      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Men can do nothing without the make-believe of a beginning. Even
    science, the strict measurer, is obliged to start with a make-believe
    unit, and must fix on a point in the stars&rsquo; unceasing journey when his
    sidereal clock shall pretend that time is at Nought. His less accurate
    grandmother Poetry has always been understood to start in the middle;
    but on reflection it appears that her proceeding is not very different
    from his; since Science, too, reckons backward as well as forward,
    divides his unit into billions, and with his clock-finger at Nought
    really sets off <i>in medias res</i>. No retrospect will take us to
    the true beginning; and whether our prologue be in heaven or on earth,
    it is but a fraction of that all-presupposing fact with which our
    story sets out.
</pre>
    <p>
      Was she beautiful or not beautiful? and what was the secret of form or
      expression which gave the dynamic quality to her glance? Was the good or
      the evil genius dominant in those beams? Probably the evil; else why was
      the effect that of unrest rather than of undisturbed charm? Why was the
      wish to look again felt as coercion and not as a longing in which the
      whole being consents?
    </p>
    <p>
      She who raised these questions in Daniel Deronda&rsquo;s mind was occupied
      in gambling: not in the open air under a southern sky, tossing coppers on
      a ruined wall, with rags about her limbs; but in one of those splendid
      resorts which the enlightenment of ages has prepared for the same species
      of pleasure at a heavy cost of gilt mouldings, dark-toned color and chubby
      nudities, all correspondingly heavy&mdash;forming a suitable condenser for
      human breath belonging, in great part, to the highest fashion, and not
      easily procurable to be breathed in elsewhere in the like proportion, at
      least by persons of little fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was near four o&rsquo;clock on a September day, so that the atmosphere
      was well-brewed to a visible haze. There was deep stillness, broken only
      by a light rattle, a light chink, a small sweeping sound, and an
      occasional monotone in French, such as might be expected to issue from an
      ingeniously constructed automaton. Round two long tables were gathered two
      serried crowds of human beings, all save one having their faces and
      attention bent on the tables. The one exception was a melancholy little
      boy, with his knees and calves simply in their natural clothing of
      epidermis, but for the rest of his person in a fancy dress. He alone had
      his face turned toward the doorway, and fixing on it the blank gaze of a
      bedizened child stationed as a masquerading advertisement on the platform
      of an itinerant show, stood close behind a lady deeply engaged at the
      roulette-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this table fifty or sixty persons were assembled, many in the outer
      rows, where there was occasionally a deposit of new-comers, being mere
      spectators, only that one of them, usually a woman, might now and then be
      observed putting down a five-franc with a simpering air, just to see what
      the passion of gambling really was. Those who were taking their pleasure
      at a higher strength, and were absorbed in play, showed very distant
      varieties of European type: Livonian and Spanish, Graeco-Italian and
      miscellaneous German, English aristocratic and English plebeian. Here
      certainly was a striking admission of human equality. The white bejewelled
      fingers of an English countess were very near touching a bony, yellow,
      crab-like hand stretching a bared wrist to clutch a heap of coin&mdash;a
      hand easy to sort with the square, gaunt face, deep-set eyes, grizzled
      eyebrows, and ill-combed scanty hair which seemed a slight metamorphosis
      of the vulture. And where else would her ladyship have graciously
      consented to sit by that dry-lipped feminine figure prematurely old,
      withered after short bloom like her artificial flowers, holding a shabby
      velvet reticule before her, and occasionally putting in her mouth the
      point with which she pricked her card? There too, very near the fair
      countess, was a respectable London tradesman, blonde and soft-handed, his
      sleek hair scrupulously parted behind and before, conscious of circulars
      addressed to the nobility and gentry, whose distinguished patronage
      enabled him to take his holidays fashionably, and to a certain extent in
      their distinguished company. Not his the gambler&rsquo;s passion that
      nullifies appetite, but a well-fed leisure, which, in the intervals of
      winning money in business and spending it showily, sees no better resource
      than winning money in play and spending it yet more showily&mdash;reflecting
      always that Providence had never manifested any disapprobation of his
      amusement, and dispassionate enough to leave off if the sweetness of
      winning much and seeing others lose had turned to the sourness of losing
      much and seeing others win. For the vice of gambling lay in losing money
      at it. In his bearing there might be something of the tradesman, but in
      his pleasures he was fit to rank with the owners of the oldest titles.
      Standing close to his chair was a handsome Italian, calm, statuesque,
      reaching across him to place the first pile of napoleons from a new bagful
      just brought him by an envoy with a scrolled mustache. The pile was in
      half a minute pushed over to an old bewigged woman with eye-glasses
      pinching her nose. There was a slight gleam, a faint mumbling smile about
      the lips of the old woman; but the statuesque Italian remained impassive,
      and&mdash;probably secure in an infallible system which placed his foot on
      the neck of chance&mdash;immediately prepared a new pile. So did a man
      with the air of an emaciated beau or worn-out libertine, who looked at
      life through one eye-glass, and held out his hand tremulously when he
      asked for change. It could surely be no severity of system, but rather
      some dream of white crows, or the induction that the eighth of the month
      was lucky, which inspired the fierce yet tottering impulsiveness of his
      play.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, while every single player differed markedly from every other, there
      was a certain uniform negativeness of expression which had the effect of a
      mask&mdash;as if they had all eaten of some root that for the time
      compelled the brains of each to the same narrow monotony of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda&rsquo;s first thought when his eyes fell on this scene of dull,
      gas-poisoned absorption, was that the gambling of Spanish shepherd-boys
      had seemed to him more enviable:&mdash;so far Rousseau might be justified
      in maintaining that art and science had done a poor service to mankind.
      But suddenly he felt the moment become dramatic. His attention was
      arrested by a young lady who, standing at an angle not far from him, was
      the last to whom his eyes traveled. She was bending and speaking English
      to a middle-aged lady seated at play beside her: but the next instant she
      returned to her play, and showed the full height of a graceful figure,
      with a face which might possibly be looked at without admiration, but
      could hardly be passed with indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inward debate which she raised in Deronda gave to his eyes a growing
      expression of scrutiny, tending farther and farther away from the glow of
      mingled undefined sensibilities forming admiration. At one moment they
      followed the movements of the figure, of the arms and hands, as this
      problematic sylph bent forward to deposit her stake with an air of firm
      choice; and the next they returned to the face which, at present
      unaffected by beholders, was directed steadily toward the game. The sylph
      was a winner; and as her taper fingers, delicately gloved in pale-gray,
      were adjusting the coins which had been pushed toward her in order to pass
      them back again to the winning point, she looked round her with a survey
      too markedly cold and neutral not to have in it a little of that nature
      which we call art concealing an inward exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the course of that survey her eyes met Deronda&rsquo;s, and instead
      of averting them as she would have desired to do, she was unpleasantly
      conscious that they were arrested&mdash;how long? The darting sense that
      he was measuring her and looking down on her as an inferior, that he was
      of different quality from the human dross around her, that he felt himself
      in a region outside and above her, and was examining her as a specimen of
      a lower order, roused a tingling resentment which stretched the moment
      with conflict. It did not bring the blood to her cheeks, but it sent it
      away from her lips. She controlled herself by the help of an inward
      defiance, and without other sign of emotion than this lip-paleness turned
      to her play. But Deronda&rsquo;s gaze seemed to have acted as an evil eye.
      Her stake was gone. No matter; she had been winning ever since she took to
      roulette with a few napoleons at command, and had a considerable reserve.
      She had begun to believe in her luck, others had begun to believe in it:
      she had visions of being followed by a <i>cortège</i> who would worship
      her as a goddess of luck and watch her play as a directing augury. Such
      things had been known of male gamblers; why should not a woman have a like
      supremacy? Her friend and chaperon who had not wished her to play at first
      was beginning to approve, only administering the prudent advice to stop at
      the right moment and carry money back to England&mdash;advice to which
      Gwendolen had replied that she cared for the excitement of play, not the
      winnings. On that supposition the present moment ought to have made the
      flood-tide in her eager experience of gambling. Yet, when her next stake
      was swept away, she felt the orbits of her eyes getting hot, and the
      certainty she had (without looking) of that man still watching her was
      something like a pressure which begins to be torturing. The more reason to
      her why she should not flinch, but go on playing as if she were
      indifferent to loss or gain. Her friend touched her elbow and proposed
      that they should quit the table. For reply Gwendolen put ten louis on the
      same spot: she was in that mood of defiance in which the mind loses sight
      of any end beyond the satisfaction of enraged resistance; and with the
      puerile stupidity of a dominant impulse includes luck among its objects of
      defiance. Since she was not winning strikingly, the next best thing was to
      lose strikingly. She controlled her muscles, and showed no tremor of mouth
      or hands. Each time her stake was swept off she doubled it. Many were now
      watching her, but the sole observation she was conscious of was Deronda&rsquo;s,
      who, though she never looked toward him, she was sure had not moved away.
      Such a drama takes no long while to play out: development and catastrophe
      can often be measured by nothing clumsier than the moment-hand. &ldquo;Faites
      votre jeu, mesdames et messieurs,&rdquo; said the automatic voice of
      destiny from between the mustache and imperial of the croupier: and
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s arm was stretched to deposit her last poor heap of
      napoleons. &ldquo;Le jeu ne va plus,&rdquo; said destiny. And in five
      seconds Gwendolen turned from the table, but turned resolutely with her
      face toward Deronda and looked at him. There was a smile of irony in his
      eyes as their glances met; but it was at least better that he should have
      kept his attention fixed on her than that he disregarded her as one of an
      insect swarm who had no individual physiognomy. Besides, in spite of his
      superciliousness and irony, it was difficult to believe that he did not
      admire her spirit as well as her person: he was young, handsome,
      distinguished in appearance&mdash;not one of these ridiculous and dowdy
      Philistines who thought it incumbent on them to blight the gaming-table
      with a sour look of protest as they passed by it. The general conviction
      that we are admirable does not easily give way before a single negative;
      rather when any of Vanity&rsquo;s large family, male or female, find their
      performance received coldly, they are apt to believe that a little more of
      it will win over the unaccountable dissident. In Gwendolen&rsquo;s habits
      of mind it had been taken for granted that she knew what was admirable and
      that she herself was admired. This basis of her thinking had received a
      disagreeable concussion, and reeled a little, but was not easily to be
      overthrown.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening the same room was more stiflingly heated, was brilliant
      with gas and with the costumes of ladies who floated their trains along it
      or were seated on the ottomans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nereid in sea-green robes and silver ornaments, with a pale sea-green
      feather fastened in silver falling backward over her green hat and light
      brown hair, was Gwendolen Harleth. She was under the wing, or rather
      soared by the shoulder, of the lady who had sat by her at the
      roulette-table; and with them was a gentleman with a white mustache and
      clipped hair: solid-browed, stiff and German. They were walking about or
      standing to chat with acquaintances, and Gwendolen was much observed by
      the seated groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A striking girl&mdash;that Miss Harleth&mdash;unlike others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she has got herself up as a sort of serpent now&mdash;all
      green and silver, and winds her neck about a little more than usual.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she must always be doing something extraordinary. She is that
      kind of girl, I fancy. Do you think her pretty, Mr. Vandernoodt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very. A man might risk hanging for her&mdash;I mean a fool might.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like a <i>nez retroussé</i>, then, and long narrow eyes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they go with such an <i>ensemble</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>ensemble du serpent</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will. Woman was tempted by a serpent; why not man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is certainly very graceful; but she wants a tinge of color in
      her cheeks. It is a sort of Lamia beauty she has.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I think her complexion one of her chief charms. It
      is a warm paleness; it looks thoroughly healthy. And that delicate nose
      with its gradual little upward curve is distracting. And then her mouth&mdash;there
      never was a prettier mouth, the lips curled backward so finely, eh,
      Mackworth?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think so? I cannot endure that sort of mouth. It looks so
      self-complacent, as if it knew its own beauty&mdash;the curves are too
      immovable. I like a mouth that trembles more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part, I think her odious,&rdquo; said a dowager. &ldquo;It
      is wonderful what unpleasant girls get into vogue. Who are these Langens?
      Does anybody know them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are quite <i>comme il faut</i>. I have dined with them several
      times at the <i>Russie</i>. The baroness is English. Miss Harleth calls
      her cousin. The girl herself is thoroughly well-bred, and as clever as
      possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! and the baron?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very good furniture picture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your baroness is always at the roulette-table,&rdquo; said
      Mackworth. &ldquo;I fancy she has taught the girl to gamble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the old woman plays a very sober game; drops a ten-franc piece
      here and there. The girl is more headlong. But it is only a freak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear she has lost all her winnings to-day. Are they rich? Who
      knows?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, who knows? Who knows that about anybody?&rdquo; said Mr.
      Vandernoodt, moving off to join the Langens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remark that Gwendolen wound her neck about more than usual this
      evening was true. But it was not that she might carry out the serpent idea
      more completely: it was that she watched for any chance of seeing Deronda,
      so that she might inquire about this stranger, under whose measuring gaze
      she was still wincing. At last her opportunity came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vandernoodt, you know everybody,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, not too
      eagerly, rather with a certain languor of utterance which she sometimes
      gave to her clear soprano. &ldquo;Who is that near the door?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are half a dozen near the door. Do you mean that old Adonis
      in the George the Fourth wig?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; the dark-haired young man on the right with the dreadful
      expression.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadful, do you call it? I think he is an uncommonly fine fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is lately come to our hotel with Sir Hugo Mallinger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Hugo Mallinger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Do you know him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; (Gwendolen colored slightly.) &ldquo;He has a place near
      us, but he never comes to it. What did you say was the name of that
      gentleman near the door?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deronda&mdash;Mr. Deronda.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a delightful name! Is he an Englishman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He is reported to be rather closely related to the baronet.
      You are interested in him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I think he is not like young men in general.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t admire young men in general?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. I always know what they will say. I can&rsquo;t
      at all guess what this Mr. Deronda would say. What <i>does</i> he say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, chiefly. I sat with his party for a good hour last night
      on the terrace, and he never spoke&mdash;and was not smoking either. He
      looked bored.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another reason why I should like to know him. I am always bored.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think he would be charmed to have an introduction. Shall I
      bring it about? Will you allow it, baroness?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&mdash;since he is related to Sir Hugo Mallinger. It is a
      new <i>rôle</i> of yours, Gwendolen, to be always bored,&rdquo; continued
      Madame von Langen, when Mr. Vandernoodt had moved away. &ldquo;Until now
      you have always seemed eager about something from morning till night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just because I am bored to death. If I am to leave off play
      I must break my arm or my collar-bone. I must make something happen;
      unless you will go into Switzerland and take me up the Matterhorn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps this Mr. Deronda&rsquo;s acquaintance will do instead of
      the Matterhorn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gwendolen did not make Deronda&rsquo;s acquaintance on this occasion.
      Mr. Vandernoodt did not succeed in bringing him up to her that evening,
      and when she re-entered her own room she found a letter recalling her
      home.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  This man contrives a secret &lsquo;twixt us two,
  That he may quell me with his meeting eyes
  Like one who quells a lioness at bay.
</pre>
    <p>
      This was the letter Gwendolen found on her table:,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    DEAREST CHILD.&mdash;I have been expecting to hear from you for a week. In
    your last you said the Langens thought of leaving Leubronn and going
    to Baden. How could you be so thoughtless as to leave me in
    uncertainty about your address? I am in the greatest anxiety lest this
    should not reach you. In any case, you were to come home at the end of
    September, and I must now entreat you to return as quickly as
    possible, for if you spent all your money it would be out of my power
    to send you any more, and you must not borrow of the Langens, for I
    could not repay them. This is the sad truth, my child&mdash;I wish I could
    prepare you for it better&mdash;but a dreadful calamity has befallen us
    all. You know nothing about business and will not understand it; but
    Grapnell &amp; Co. have failed for a million, and we are totally
    ruined&mdash;your aunt Gascoigne as well as I, only that your uncle has his
    benefice, so that by putting down their carriage and getting interest
    for the boys, the family can go on. All the property our poor father
    saved for us goes to pay the liabilities. There is nothing I can call
    my own. It is better you should know this at once, though it rends my
    heart to have to tell it you. Of course we cannot help thinking what a
    pity it was that you went away just when you did. But I shall never
    reproach you, my dear child; I would save you from all trouble if I
    could. On your way home you will have time to prepare yourself for the
    change you will find. We shall perhaps leave Offendene at once, for we
    hope that Mr. Haynes, who wanted it before, may be ready to take it
    off my hands. Of course we cannot go to the rectory&mdash;there is not a
    corner there to spare. We must get some hut or other to shelter us,
    and we must live on your uncle Gascoigne&rsquo;s charity, until I see what
    else can be done. I shall not be able to pay the debts to the
    tradesmen besides the servants&rsquo; wages. Summon up your fortitude, my
    dear child; we must resign ourselves to God&rsquo;s will. But it is hard to
    resign one&rsquo;s self to Mr. Lassman&rsquo;s wicked recklessness, which they say
    was the cause of the failure. Your poor sisters can only cry with me
    and give me no help. If you were once here, there might be a break in
    the cloud&mdash;I always feel it impossible that you can have been meant
    for poverty. If the Langens wish to remain abroad, perhaps you can put
    yourself under some one else&rsquo;s care for the journey. But come as soon
    as you can to your afflicted and loving mamma,

    FANNY DAVILOW.
</pre>
    <p>
      The first effect of this letter on Gwendolen was half-stupefying. The
      implicit confidence that her destiny must be one of luxurious ease, where
      any trouble that occurred would be well clad and provided for, had been
      stronger in her own mind than in her mamma&rsquo;s, being fed there by her
      youthful blood and that sense of superior claims which made a large part
      of her consciousness. It was almost as difficult for her to believe
      suddenly that her position had become one of poverty and of humiliating
      dependence, as it would have been to get into the strong current of her
      blooming life the chill sense that her death would really come. She stood
      motionless for a few minutes, then tossed off her hat and automatically
      looked in the glass. The coils of her smooth light-brown hair were still
      in order perfect enough for a ball-room; and as on other nights, Gwendolen
      might have looked lingeringly at herself for pleasure (surely an allowable
      indulgence); but now she took no conscious note of her reflected beauty,
      and simply stared right before her as if she had been jarred by a hateful
      sound and was waiting for any sign of its cause. By-and-by she threw
      herself in the corner of the red velvet sofa, took up the letter again and
      read it twice deliberately, letting it at last fall on the ground, while
      she rested her clasped hands on her lap and sat perfectly still, shedding
      no tears. Her impulse was to survey and resist the situation rather than
      to wail over it. There was no inward exclamation of &ldquo;Poor mamma!&rdquo;
      Her mamma had never seemed to get much enjoyment out of life, and if
      Gwendolen had been at this moment disposed to feel pity she would have
      bestowed it on herself&mdash;for was she not naturally and rightfully the
      chief object of her mamma&rsquo;s anxiety too? But it was anger, it was
      resistance that possessed her; it was bitter vexation that she had lost
      her gains at roulette, whereas if her luck had continued through this one
      day she would have had a handsome sum to carry home, or she might have
      gone on playing and won enough to support them all. Even now was it not
      possible? She had only four napoleons left in her purse, but she possessed
      some ornaments which she could sell: a practice so common in stylish
      society at German baths that there was no need to be ashamed of it; and
      even if she had not received her mamma&rsquo;s letter, she would probably
      have decided to get money for an Etruscan necklace which she happened not
      to have been wearing since her arrival; nay, she might have done so with
      an agreeable sense that she was living with some intensity and escaping
      humdrum. With ten louis at her disposal and a return of her former luck,
      which seemed probable, what could she do better than go on playing for a
      few days? If her friends at home disapproved of the way in which she got
      the money, as they certainly would, still the money would be there.
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s imagination dwelt on this course and created agreeable
      consequences, but not with unbroken confidence and rising certainty as it
      would have done if she had been touched with the gambler&rsquo;s mania.
      She had gone to the roulette-table not because of passion, but in search
      of it: her mind was still sanely capable of picturing balanced
      probabilities, and while the chance of winning allured her, the chance of
      losing thrust itself on her with alternate strength and made a vision from
      which her pride sank sensitively. For she was resolved not to tell the
      Langens that any misfortune had befallen her family, or to make herself in
      any way indebted to their compassion; and if she were to part with her
      jewelry to any observable extent, they would interfere by inquiries and
      remonstrances. The course that held the least risk of intolerable
      annoyance was to raise money on her necklace early in the morning, tell
      the Langens that her mother desired her immediate return without giving a
      reason, and take the train for Brussels that evening. She had no maid with
      her, and the Langens might make difficulties about her returning home, but
      her will was peremptory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of going to bed she made as brilliant a light as she could and
      began to pack, working diligently, though all the while visited by the
      scenes that might take place on the coming day&mdash;now by the tiresome
      explanations and farewells, and the whirling journey toward a changed
      home, now by the alternative of staying just another day and standing
      again at the roulette-table. But always in this latter scene there was the
      presence of that Deronda, watching her with exasperating irony, and&mdash;the
      two keen experiences were inevitably revived together&mdash;beholding her
      again forsaken by luck. This importunate image certainly helped to sway
      her resolve on the side of immediate departure, and to urge her packing to
      the point which would make a change of mind inconvenient. It had struck
      twelve when she came into her room, and by the time she was assuring
      herself that she had left out only what was necessary, the faint dawn was
      stealing through the white blinds and dulling her candles. What was the
      use of going to bed? Her cold bath was refreshment enough, and she saw
      that a slight trace of fatigue about the eyes only made her look the more
      interesting. Before six o&rsquo;clock she was completely equipped in her
      gray traveling dress even to her felt hat, for she meant to walk out as
      soon as she could count on seeing other ladies on their way to the
      springs. And happening to be seated sideways before the long strip of
      mirror between her two windows she turned to look at herself, leaning her
      elbow on the back of the chair in an attitude that might have been chosen
      for her portrait. It is possible to have a strong self-love without any
      self-satisfaction, rather with a self-discontent which is the more intense
      because one&rsquo;s own little core of egoistic sensibility is a supreme
      care; but Gwendolen knew nothing of such inward strife. She had a <i>naïve</i>
      delight in her fortunate self, which any but the harshest saintliness will
      have some indulgence for in a girl who had every day seen a pleasant
      reflection of that self in her friends&rsquo; flattery as well as in the
      looking-glass. And even in this beginning of troubles, while for lack of
      anything else to do she sat gazing at her image in the growing light, her
      face gathered a complacency gradual as the cheerfulness of the morning.
      Her beautiful lips curled into a more and more decided smile, till at last
      she took off her hat, leaned forward and kissed the cold glass which had
      looked so warm. How could she believe in sorrow? If it attacked her, she
      felt the force to crush it, to defy it, or run away from it, as she had
      done already. Anything seemed more possible than that she could go on
      bearing miseries, great or small.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame von Langen never went out before breakfast, so that Gwendolen could
      safely end her early walk by taking her way homeward through the Obere
      Strasse in which was the needed shop, sure to be open after seven. At that
      hour any observers whom she minded would be either on their walks in the
      region of the springs, or would be still in their bedrooms; but certainly
      there was one grand hotel, the <i>Czarina</i> from which eyes might follow
      her up to Mr. Wiener&rsquo;s door. This was a chance to be risked: might
      she not be going in to buy something which had struck her fancy? This
      implicit falsehood passed through her mind as she remembered that the <i>Czarina</i>
      was Deronda&rsquo;s hotel; but she was then already far up the Obere
      Strasse, and she walked on with her usual floating movement, every line in
      her figure and drapery falling in gentle curves attractive to all eyes
      except those which discerned in them too close a resemblance to the
      serpent, and objected to the revival of serpent-worship. She looked
      neither to the right hand nor to the left, and transacted her business in
      the shop with a coolness which gave little Mr. Wiener nothing to remark
      except her proud grace of manner, and the superior size and quality of the
      three central turquoises in the necklace she offered him. They had
      belonged to a chain once her father&rsquo;s: but she had never known her
      father; and the necklace was in all respects the ornament she could most
      conveniently part with. Who supposes that it is an impossible
      contradiction to be superstitious and rationalizing at the same time?
      Roulette encourages a romantic superstition as to the chances of the game,
      and the most prosaic rationalism as to human sentiments which stand in the
      way of raising needful money. Gwendolen&rsquo;s dominant regret was that
      after all she had only nine louis to add to the four in her purse: these
      Jew dealers were so unscrupulous in taking advantage of Christians
      unfortunate at play! But she was the Langens&rsquo; guest in their hired
      apartment, and had nothing to pay there: thirteen louis would do more than
      take her home; even if she determined on risking three, the remaining ten
      would more than suffice, since she meant to travel right on, day and
      night. As she turned homeward, nay, entered and seated herself in the <i>salon</i>
      to await her friends and breakfast, she still wavered as to her immediate
      departure, or rather she had concluded to tell the Langens simply that she
      had had a letter from her mamma desiring her return, and to leave it still
      undecided when she should start. It was already the usual breakfast-time,
      and hearing some one enter as she was leaning back rather tired and hungry
      with her eyes shut, she rose expecting to see one or other of the Langens&mdash;the
      words which might determine her lingering at least another day,
      ready-formed to pass her lips. But it was the servant bringing in a small
      packet for Miss Harleth, which had at that moment been left at the door.
      Gwendolen took it in her hand and immediately hurried into her own room.
      She looked paler and more agitated than when she had first read her mamma&rsquo;s
      letter. Something&mdash;she never quite knew what&mdash;revealed to her
      before she opened the packet that it contained the necklace she had just
      parted with. Underneath the paper it was wrapped in a cambric
      handkerchief, and within this was a scrap of torn-off note-paper, on which
      was written with a pencil, in clear but rapid handwriting&mdash;&ldquo;<i>A
      stranger who has found Miss Harleth&rsquo;s necklace returns it to her
      with the hope that she will not again risk the loss of it.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen reddened with the vexation of wounded pride. A large corner of
      the handkerchief seemed to have been recklessly torn off to get rid of a
      mark; but she at once believed in the first image of &ldquo;the stranger&rdquo;
      that presented itself to her mind. It was Deronda; he must have seen her
      go into the shop; he must have gone in immediately after and repurchased
      the necklace. He had taken an unpardonable liberty, and had dared to place
      her in a thoroughly hateful position. What could she do?&mdash;Not,
      assuredly, act on her conviction that it was he who had sent her the
      necklace and straightway send it back to him: that would be to face the
      possibility that she had been mistaken; nay, even if the &ldquo;stranger&rdquo;
      were he and no other, it would be something too gross for her to let him
      know that she had divined this, and to meet him again with that
      recognition in their minds. He knew very well that he was entangling her
      in helpless humiliation: it was another way of smiling at her ironically,
      and taking the air of a supercilious mentor. Gwendolen felt the bitter
      tears of mortification rising and rolling down her cheeks. No one had ever
      before dared to treat her with irony and contempt. One thing was clear:
      she must carry out her resolution to quit this place at once; it was
      impossible for her to reappear in the public <i>salon</i>, still less
      stand at the gaming-table with the risk of seeing Deronda. Now came an
      importunate knock at the door: breakfast was ready. Gwendolen with a
      passionate movement thrust necklace, cambric, scrap of paper, and all into
      her <i>nécessaire</i>, pressed her handkerchief against her face, and
      after pausing a minute or two to summon back her proud self-control, went
      to join her friends. Such signs of tears and fatigue as were left seemed
      accordant enough with the account she at once gave of her having sat up to
      do her packing, instead of waiting for help from her friend&rsquo;s maid.
      There was much protestation, as she had expected, against her traveling
      alone, but she persisted in refusing any arrangements for companionship.
      She would be put into the ladies&rsquo; compartment and go right on. She
      could rest exceedingly well in the train, and was afraid of nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way it happened that Gwendolen never reappeared at the
      roulette-table, but that Thursday evening left Leubronn for Brussels, and
      on Saturday morning arrived at Offendene, the home to which she and her
      family were soon to say a last good-bye.

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Let no flower of the spring pass by us; let us crown ourselves with
    rosebuds before they be withered.&rdquo;&mdash;BOOK OF WISDOM.
</pre>
    <p>
      Pity that Offendene was not the home of Miss Harleth&rsquo;s childhood, or
      endeared to her by family memories! A human life, I think, should be well
      rooted in some spot of a native land, where it may get the love of tender
      kinship for the face of earth, for the labors men go forth to, for the
      sounds and accents that haunt it, for whatever will give that early home a
      familiar unmistakable difference amid the future widening of knowledge: a
      spot where the definiteness of early memories may be inwrought with
      affection, and&mdash;kindly acquaintance with all neighbors, even to the
      dogs and donkeys, may spread not by sentimental effort and reflection, but
      as a sweet habit of the blood. At five years old, mortals are not prepared
      to be citizens of the world, to be stimulated by abstract nouns, to soar
      above preference into impartiality; and that prejudice in favor of milk
      with which we blindly begin, is a type of the way body and soul must get
      nourished at least for a time. The best introduction to astronomy is to
      think of the nightly heavens as a little lot of stars belonging to one&rsquo;s
      own homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this blessed persistence in which affection can take root had been
      wanting in Gwendolen&rsquo;s life. It was only a year before her recall
      from Leubronn that Offendene had been chosen as her mamma&rsquo;s home,
      simply for its nearness to Pennicote Rectory, and that Mrs. Davilow,
      Gwendolen, and her four half-sisters (the governess and the maid following
      in another vehicle) had been driven along the avenue for the first time,
      on a late October afternoon when the rooks were crawing loudly above them,
      and the yellow elm-leaves were whirling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The season suited the aspect of the old oblong red-brick house, rather too
      anxiously ornamented with stone at every line, not excepting the double
      row of narrow windows and the large square portico. The stone encouraged a
      greenish lichen, the brick a powdery gray, so that though the building was
      rigidly rectangular there was no harshness in the physiognomy which it
      turned to the three avenues cut east, west and south in the hundred yards&rsquo;
      breadth of old plantation encircling the immediate grounds. One would have
      liked the house to have been lifted on a knoll, so as to look beyond its
      own little domain to the long thatched roofs of the distant villages, the
      church towers, the scattered homesteads, the gradual rise of surging
      woods, and the green breadths of undulating park which made the beautiful
      face of the earth in that part of Wessex. But though standing thus behind
      a screen amid flat pastures, it had on one side a glimpse of the wider
      world in the lofty curves of the chalk downs, grand steadfast forms played
      over by the changing days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was but just large enough to be called a mansion, and was
      moderately rented, having no manor attached to it, and being rather
      difficult to let with its sombre furniture and faded upholstery. But
      inside and outside it was what no beholder could suppose to be inhabited
      by retired trades-people: a certainty which was worth many conveniences to
      tenants who not only had the taste that shrinks from new finery, but also
      were in that border-territory of rank where annexation is a burning topic:
      and to take up her abode in a house which had once sufficed for dowager
      countesses gave a perceptible tinge to Mrs. Davilow&rsquo;s satisfaction
      in having an establishment of her own. This, rather mysteriously to
      Gwendolen, appeared suddenly possible on the death of her step-father,
      Captain Davilow, who had for the last nine years joined his family only in
      a brief and fitful manner, enough to reconcile them to his long absences;
      but she cared much more for the fact than for the explanation. All her
      prospects had become more agreeable in consequence. She had disliked their
      former way of life, roving from one foreign watering-place or Parisian
      apartment to another, always feeling new antipathies to new suites of
      hired furniture, and meeting new people under conditions which made her
      appear of little importance; and the variation of having passed two years
      at a showy school, where, on all occasions of display, she had been put
      foremost, had only deepened her sense that so exceptional a person as
      herself could hardly remain in ordinary circumstances or in a social
      position less than advantageous. Any fear of this latter evil was banished
      now that her mamma was to have an establishment; for on the point of birth
      Gwendolen was quite easy. She had no notion how her maternal grandfather
      got the fortune inherited by his two daughters; but he had been a West
      Indian&mdash;which seemed to exclude further question; and she knew that
      her father&rsquo;s family was so high as to take no notice of her mamma,
      who nevertheless preserved with much pride the miniature of a Lady Molly
      in that connection. She would probably have known much more about her
      father but for a little incident which happened when she was twelve years
      old. Mrs. Davilow had brought out, as she did only at wide intervals,
      various memorials of her first husband, and while showing his miniature to
      Gwendolen recalled with a fervor which seemed to count on a peculiar
      filial sympathy, the fact that dear papa had died when his little daughter
      was in long clothes. Gwendolen, immediately thinking of the unlovable
      step-father whom she had been acquainted with the greater part of her life
      while her frocks were short, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you marry again, mamma? It would have been nicer if you had
      not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow colored deeply, a slight convulsive movement passed over her
      face, and straightway shutting up the memorials she said, with a violence
      quite unusual in her,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no feeling, child!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen, who was fond of her mamma, felt hurt and ashamed, and had never
      since dared to ask a question about her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not the only instance in which she had brought on herself the
      pain of some filial compunction. It was always arranged, when possible,
      that she should have a small bed in her mamma&rsquo;s room; for Mrs.
      Davilow&rsquo;s motherly tenderness clung chiefly to her eldest girl, who
      had been born in her happier time. One night under an attack of pain she
      found that the specific regularly placed by her bedside had been
      forgotten, and begged Gwendolen to get out of bed and reach it for her.
      That healthy young lady, snug and warm as a rosy infant in her little
      couch, objected to step out into the cold, and lying perfectly still,
      grumbling a refusal. Mrs. Davilow went without the medicine and never
      reproached her daughter; but the next day Gwendolen was keenly conscious
      of what must be in her mamma&rsquo;s mind, and tried to make amends by
      caresses which cost her no effort. Having always been the pet and pride of
      the household, waited on by mother, sisters, governess and maids, as if
      she had been a princess in exile, she naturally found it difficult to
      think her own pleasure less important than others made it, and when it was
      positively thwarted felt an astonished resentment apt, in her cruder days,
      to vent itself in one of those passionate acts which look like a
      contradiction of habitual tendencies. Though never even as a child
      thoughtlessly cruel, nay delighting to rescue drowning insects and watch
      their recovery, there was a disagreeable silent remembrance of her having
      strangled her sister&rsquo;s canary-bird in a final fit of exasperation at
      its shrill singing which had again and again jarringly interrupted her
      own. She had taken pains to buy a white mouse for her sister in
      retribution, and though inwardly excusing herself on the ground of a
      peculiar sensitiveness which was a mark of her general superiority, the
      thought of that infelonious murder had always made her wince. Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      nature was not remorseless, but she liked to make her penances easy, and
      now that she was twenty and more, some of her native force had turned into
      a self-control by which she guarded herself from penitential humiliation.
      There was more show of fire and will in her than ever, but there was more
      calculation underneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this day of arrival at Offendene, which not even Mrs. Davilow had seen
      before&mdash;the place having been taken for her by her brother-in-law,
      Mr. Gascoigne&mdash;when all had got down from the carriage, and were
      standing under the porch in front of the open door, so that they could
      have a general view of the place and a glimpse of the stone hall and
      staircase hung with sombre pictures, but enlivened by a bright wood fire,
      no one spoke; mamma, the four sisters and the governess all looked at
      Gwendolen, as if their feelings depended entirely on her decision. Of the
      girls, from Alice in her sixteenth year to Isabel in her tenth, hardly
      anything could be said on a first view, but that they were girlish, and
      that their black dresses were getting shabby. Miss Merry was elderly and
      altogether neutral in expression. Mrs. Davilow&rsquo;s worn beauty seemed
      the more pathetic for the look of entire appeal which she cast at
      Gwendolen, who was glancing round at the house, the landscape and the
      entrance hall with an air of rapid judgment. Imagine a young race-horse in
      the paddock among untrimmed ponies and patient hacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear, what do you think of the place,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow at last, in a gentle, deprecatory tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is charming,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, quickly. &ldquo;A
      romantic place; anything delightful may happen in it; it would be a good
      background for anything. No one need be ashamed of living here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is certainly nothing common about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it would do for fallen royalty or any sort of grand poverty. We
      ought properly to have been living in splendor, and have come down to
      this. It would have been as romantic as could be. But I thought my uncle
      and aunt Gascoigne would be here to meet us, and my cousin Anna,&rdquo;
      added Gwendolen, her tone changed to sharp surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are early,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, and entering the hall, she
      said to the housekeeper who came forward, &ldquo;You expect Mr. and Mrs.
      Gascoigne?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam; they were here yesterday to give particular orders
      about the fires and the dinner. But as to fires, I&rsquo;ve had &lsquo;em
      in all the rooms for the last week, and everything is well aired. I could
      wish some of the furniture paid better for all the cleaning it&rsquo;s
      had, but I <i>think</i> you&rsquo;ll see the brasses have been done
      justice to. I <i>think</i> when Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne come, they&rsquo;ll
      tell you nothing has been neglected. They&rsquo;ll be here at five, for
      certain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This satisfied Gwendolen, who was not prepared to have their arrival
      treated with indifference; and after tripping a little way up the matted
      stone staircase to take a survey there, she tripped down again, and
      followed by all the girls looked into each of the rooms opening from the
      hall&mdash;the dining-room all dark oak and worn red satin damask, with a
      copy of snarling, worrying dogs from Snyders over the side-board, and a
      Christ breaking bread over the mantel-piece; the library with a general
      aspect and smell of old brown-leather; and lastly, the drawing-room, which
      was entered through a small antechamber crowded with venerable
      knick-knacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, mamma, pray come here!&rdquo; said Gwendolen, Mrs. Davilow
      having followed slowly in talk with the housekeeper. &ldquo;Here is an
      organ. I will be Saint Cecilia: some one shall paint me as Saint Cecilia.
      Jocosa (this was her name for Miss Merry), let down my hair. See, mamma?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had thrown off her hat and gloves, and seated herself before the organ
      in an admirable pose, looking upward; while the submissive and sad Jocosa
      took out the one comb which fastened the coil of hair, and then shook out
      the mass till it fell in a smooth light-brown stream far below its owner&rsquo;s
      slim waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow smiled and said, &ldquo;A charming picture, my dear!&rdquo;
      not indifferent to the display of her pet, even in the presence of a
      housekeeper. Gwendolen rose and laughed with delight. All this seemed
      quite to the purpose on entering a new house which was so excellent a
      background.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a queer, quaint, picturesque room!&rdquo; she went on, looking
      about her. &ldquo;I like these old embroidered chairs, and the garlands on
      the wainscot, and the pictures that may be anything. That one with the
      ribs&mdash;nothing but ribs and darkness&mdash;I should think that is
      Spanish, mamma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gwendolen!&rdquo; said the small Isabel, in a tone of
      astonishment, while she held open a hinged panel of the wainscot at the
      other end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one, Gwendolen first, went to look. The opened panel had disclosed
      the picture of an upturned dead face, from which an obscure figure seemed
      to be fleeing with outstretched arms. &ldquo;How horrible!&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Davilow, with a look of mere disgust; but Gwendolen shuddered
      silently, and Isabel, a plain and altogether inconvenient child with an
      alarming memory, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never stay in this room by yourself, Gwendolen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you open things which were meant to be shut up, you
      perverse little creature?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, in her angriest tone.
      Then snatching the panel out of the hand of the culprit, she closed it
      hastily, saying, &ldquo;There is a lock&mdash;where is the key? Let the
      key be found, or else let one be made, and let nobody open it again; or
      rather, let the key be brought to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this command to everybody in general Gwendolen turned with a face which
      was flushed in reaction from her chill shudder, and said, &ldquo;Let us go
      up to our own room, mamma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper on searching found the key in the drawer of the cabinet
      close by the panel, and presently handed it to Bugle, the lady&rsquo;s-maid,
      telling her significantly to give it to her Royal Highness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, Mrs. Startin,&rdquo; said Bugle,
      who had been busy up-stairs during the scene in the drawing-room, and was
      rather offended at this irony in a new servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the young lady that&rsquo;s to command us all&mdash;and well
      worthy for looks and figure,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Startin in propitiation.
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll know what key it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have laid out what we want, go and see to the others, Bugle,&rdquo;
      Gwendolen had said, when she and Mrs. Davilow entered their black and
      yellow bedroom, where a pretty little white couch was prepared by the side
      of the black and yellow catafalque known as the best bed. &ldquo;I will
      help mamma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But her first movement was to go to the tall mirror between the windows,
      which reflected herself and the room completely, while her mamma sat down
      and also looked at the reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a becoming glass, Gwendolen; or is it the black and gold
      color that sets you off?&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, as Gwendolen stood
      obliquely with her three-quarter face turned toward the mirror, and her
      left hand brushing back the stream of hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should make a tolerable St. Cecilia with some white roses on my
      head,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,&mdash;&ldquo;only how about my nose, mamma? I
      think saint&rsquo;s noses never in the least turn up. I wish you had given
      me your perfectly straight nose; it would have done for any sort of
      character&mdash;a nose of all work. Mine is only a happy nose; it would
      not do so well for tragedy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, any nose will do to be miserable with in this world,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Davilow, with a deep, weary sigh, throwing her black bonnet on
      the table, and resting her elbow near it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, in a strongly remonstrant tone,
      turning away from the glass with an air of vexation, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      begin to be dull here. It spoils all my pleasure, and everything may be so
      happy now. What have you to be gloomy about <i>now</i>?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, seeming to rouse herself,
      and beginning to take off her dress. &ldquo;It is always enough for me to
      see you happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you should be happy yourself,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, still
      discontentedly, though going to help her mamma with caressing touches.
      &ldquo;Can nobody be happy after they are quite young? You have made me
      feel sometimes as if nothing were of any use. With the girls so
      troublesome, and Jocosa so dreadfully wooden and ugly, and everything
      make-shift about us, and you looking so dull&mdash;what was the use of my
      being anything? But now you <i>might</i> be happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I shall, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, patting the cheek that
      was bending near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but really. Not with a sort of make-believe,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, with resolute perseverance. &ldquo;See what a hand and arm!&mdash;much
      more beautiful than mine. Any one can see you were altogether more
      beautiful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, dear; I was always heavier. Never half so charming as you
      are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but what is the use of my being charming, if it is to end in
      my being dull and not minding anything? Is that what marriage always comes
      to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, child, certainly not. Marriage is the only happy state for a
      woman, as I trust you will prove.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not put up with it if it is not a happy state. I am
      determined to be happy&mdash;at least not to go on muddling away my life
      as other people do, being and doing nothing remarkable. I have made up my
      mind not to let other people interfere with me as they have done. Here is
      some warm water ready for you, mamma,&rdquo; Gwendolen ended, proceeding
      to take off her own dress and then waiting to have her hair wound up by
      her mamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a minute or two, till Mrs. Davilow said, while
      coiling the daughter&rsquo;s hair, &ldquo;I am sure I have never crossed
      you, Gwendolen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You often want me to do what I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, to give Alice lessons?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And I have done it because you asked me. But I don&rsquo;t see
      why I should, else. It bores me to death, she is so slow. She has no ear
      for music, or language, or anything else. It would be much better for her
      to be ignorant, mamma: it is her <i>rôle</i>, she would do it well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a hard thing to say of your poor sister, Gwendolen, who is
      so good to you, and waits on you hand and foot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why it is hard to call things by their right
      names, and put them in their proper places. The hardship is for me to have
      to waste my time on her. Now let me fasten up your hair, mamma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must make haste; your uncle and aunt will be here soon. For
      heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t be scornful to <i>them</i>, my dear
      child! or to your cousin Anna, whom you will always be going out with. Do
      promise me, Gwendolen. You know, you can&rsquo;t expect Anna to be equal
      to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want her to be equal,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a
      toss of her head and a smile, and the discussion ended there.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne and their daughter came, Gwendolen, far from
      being scornful, behaved as prettily as possible to them. She was
      introducing herself anew to relatives who had not seen her since the
      comparatively unfinished age of sixteen, and she was anxious&mdash;no, not
      anxious, but resolved that they should admire her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gascoigne bore a family likeness to her sister. But she was darker
      and slighter, her face was unworn by grief, her movements were less
      languid, her expression more alert and critical as that of a rector&rsquo;s
      wife bound to exert a beneficent authority. Their closest resemblance lay
      in a non-resistant disposition, inclined to imitation and obedience; but
      this, owing to the difference in their circumstances, had led them to very
      different issues. The younger sister had been indiscreet, or at least
      unfortunate in her marriages; the elder believed herself the most enviable
      of wives, and her pliancy had ended in her sometimes taking shapes of
      surprising definiteness. Many of her opinions, such as those on church
      government and the character of Archbishop Laud, seemed too decided under
      every alteration to have been arrived at otherwise than by a wifely
      receptiveness. And there was much to encourage trust in her husband&rsquo;s
      authority. He had some agreeable virtues, some striking advantages, and
      the failings that were imputed to him all leaned toward the side of
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of his advantages was a fine person, which perhaps was even more
      impressive at fifty-seven than it had been earlier in life. There were no
      distinctively clerical lines in the face, no tricks of starchiness or of
      affected ease: in his Inverness cape he could not have been identified
      except as a gentleman with handsome dark features, a nose which began with
      an intention to be aquiline but suddenly became straight, and iron-gray
      hair. Perhaps he owed this freedom from the sort of professional make-up
      which penetrates skin, tones and gestures and defies all drapery, to the
      fact that he had once been Captain Gaskin, having taken orders and a
      diphthong but shortly before his engagement to Miss Armyn. If any one had
      objected that his preparation for the clerical function was inadequate,
      his friends might have asked who made a better figure in it, who preached
      better or had more authority in his parish? He had a native gift for
      administration, being tolerant both of opinions and conduct, because he
      felt himself able to overrule them, and was free from the irritations of
      conscious feebleness. He smiled pleasantly at the foible of a taste which
      he did not share&mdash;at floriculture or antiquarianism for example,
      which were much in vogue among his fellow-clergyman in the diocese: for
      himself, he preferred following the history of a campaign, or divining
      from his knowledge of Nesselrode&rsquo;s motives what would have been his
      conduct if our cabinet had taken a different course. Mr. Gascoigne&rsquo;s
      tone of thinking after some long-quieted fluctuations had become
      ecclesiastical rather than theological; not the modern Anglican, but what
      he would have called sound English, free from nonsense; such as became a
      man who looked at a national religion by daylight, and saw it in its
      relation to other things. No clerical magistrate had greater weight at
      sessions, or less of mischievous impracticableness in relation to worldly
      affairs. Indeed, the worst imputation thrown out against him was
      worldliness: it could not be proved that he forsook the less fortunate,
      but it was not to be denied that the friendships he cultivated were of a
      kind likely to be useful to the father of six sons and two daughters; and
      bitter observers&mdash;for in Wessex, say ten years ago, there were
      persons whose bitterness may now seem incredible&mdash;remarked that the
      color of his opinions had changed in consistency with this principle of
      action. But cheerful, successful worldliness has a false air of being more
      selfish than the acrid, unsuccessful kind, whose secret history is summed
      up in the terrible words, &ldquo;Sold, but not paid for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen wondered that she had not better remembered how very fine a man
      her uncle was; but at the age of sixteen she was a less capable and more
      indifferent judge. At present it was a matter of extreme interest to her
      that she was to have the near countenance of a dignified male relative,
      and that the family life would cease to be entirely, insipidly feminine.
      She did not intend that her uncle should control her, but she saw at once
      that it would be altogether agreeable to her that he should be proud of
      introducing her as his niece. And there was every sign of his being likely
      to feel that pride. He certainly looked at her with admiration as he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have outgrown Anna, my dear,&rdquo; putting his arm tenderly
      round his daughter, whose shy face was a tiny copy of his own, and drawing
      her forward. &ldquo;She is not so old as you by a year, but her growing
      days are certainly over. I hope you will be excellent companions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did give a comparing glance at his daughter, but if he saw her
      inferiority, he might also see that Anna&rsquo;s timid appearance and
      miniature figure must appeal to a different taste from that which was
      attracted by Gwendolen, and that the girls could hardly be rivals.
      Gwendolen at least, was aware of this, and kissed her cousin with real
      cordiality as well as grace, saying, &ldquo;A companion is just what I
      want. I am so glad we are come to live here. And mamma will be much
      happier now she is near you, aunt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The aunt trusted indeed that it would be so, and felt it a blessing that a
      suitable home had been vacant in their uncle&rsquo;s parish. Then, of
      course, notice had to be taken of the four other girls, whom Gwendolen had
      always felt to be superfluous: all of a girlish average that made four
      units utterly unimportant, and yet from her earliest days an obtrusive
      influential fact in her life. She was conscious of having been much kinder
      to them than could have been expected. And it was evident to her that her
      uncle and aunt also felt it a pity there were so many girls:&mdash;what
      rational person could feel otherwise, except poor mamma, who never would
      see how Alice set up her shoulders and lifted her eyebrows till she had no
      forehead left, how Bertha and Fanny whispered and tittered together about
      everything, or how Isabel was always listening and staring and forgetting
      where she was, and treading on the toes of her suffering elders?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have brothers, Anna,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, while the sisters
      were being noticed. &ldquo;I think you are enviable there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anna, simply. &ldquo;I am very fond of them; but
      of course their education is a great anxiety to papa. He used to say they
      made me a tomboy. I really was a great romp with Rex. I think you will
      like Rex. He will come home before Christmas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember I used to think you rather wild and shy; but it is
      difficult now to imagine you a romp,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I am altered now; I am come out, and all that. But in
      reality I like to go blackberrying with Edwy and Lotta as well as ever. I
      am not very fond of going out; but I dare say I shall like it better now
      you will be often with me. I am not at all clever, and I never know what
      to say. It seems so useless to say what everybody knows, and I can think
      of nothing else, except what papa says.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall like going out with you very much,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      well disposed toward this <i>naïve</i> cousin. &ldquo;Are you fond of
      riding?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but we have only one Shetland pony amongst us. Papa says he
      can&rsquo;t afford more, besides the carriage-horses and his own nag; he
      has so many expenses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to have a horse and ride a great deal now,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, in a tone of decision. &ldquo;Is the society pleasant in this
      neighborhood?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa says it is, very. There are the clergymen all about, you know;
      and the Quallons, and the Arrowpoints, and Lord Brackenshaw, and Sir Hugo
      Mallinger&rsquo;s place, where there is nobody&mdash;that&rsquo;s very
      nice, because we make picnics there&mdash;and two or three families at
      Wanchester: oh, and old Mrs. Vulcany, at Nuttingwood, and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Anna was relieved of this tax on her descriptive powers by the
      announcement of dinner, and Gwendolen&rsquo;s question was soon indirectly
      answered by her uncle, who dwelt much on the advantages he had secured for
      them in getting a place like Offendene. Except the rent, it involved no
      more expense than an ordinary house at Wanchester would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is always worth while to make a little sacrifice for a good
      style of house,&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne, in his easy, pleasantly
      confident tone, which made the world in general seem a very manageable
      place of residence: &ldquo;especially where there is only a lady at the
      head. All the best people will call upon you; and you need give no
      expensive dinners. Of course, I have to spend a good deal in that way; it
      is a large item. But then I get my house for nothing. If I had to pay
      three hundred a year for my house I could not keep a table. My boys are
      too great a drain on me. You are better off than we are, in proportion;
      there is no great drain on you now, after your house and carriage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, Fanny, now that the children are growing up, I am
      obliged to cut and contrive,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gascoigne. &ldquo;I am not a
      good manager by nature, but Henry has taught me. He is wonderful for
      making the best of everything; he allows himself no extras, and gets his
      curates for nothing. It is rather hard that he has not been made a
      prebendary or something, as others have been, considering the friends he
      has made and the need there is for men of moderate opinions in all
      respects. If the Church is to keep its position, ability and character
      ought to tell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear Nancy, you forget the old story&mdash;thank Heaven,
      there are three hundred as good as I. And ultimately, we shall have no
      reason to complain, I am pretty sure. There could hardly be a more
      thorough friend than Lord Brackenshaw&mdash;your landlord, you know,
      Fanny. Lady Brackenshaw will call upon you. And I have spoken for
      Gwendolen to be a member of our Archery Club&mdash;the Brackenshaw Archery
      Club&mdash;the most select thing anywhere. That is, if she has no
      objection,&rdquo; added Mr. Gascoigne, looking at Gwendolen with pleasant
      irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like it of all things,&rdquo; said Gwendolen. &ldquo;There
      is nothing I enjoy more than taking aim&mdash;and hitting,&rdquo; she
      ended, with a pretty nod and smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Anna, poor child, is too short-sighted for archery. But I
      consider myself a first-rate shot, and you shall practice with me. I must
      make you an accomplished archer before our great meeting in July. In fact,
      as to neighborhood, you could hardly be better placed. There are the
      Arrowpoints&mdash;they are some of our best people. Miss Arrowpoint is a
      delightful girl&mdash;she has been presented at Court. They have a
      magnificent place&mdash;Quetcham Hall&mdash;worth seeing in point of art;
      and their parties, to which you are sure to be invited, are the best
      things of the sort we have. The archdeacon is intimate there, and they
      have always a good kind of people staying in the house. Mrs. Arrowpoint is
      peculiar, certainly; something of a caricature, in fact; but well-meaning.
      And Miss Arrowpoint is as nice as possible. It is not all young ladies who
      have mothers as handsome and graceful as yours and Anna&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow smiled faintly at this little compliment, but the husband and
      wife looked affectionately at each other, and Gwendolen thought, &ldquo;My
      uncle and aunt, at least, are happy: they are not dull and dismal.&rdquo;
      Altogether, she felt satisfied with her prospects at Offendene, as a great
      improvement on anything she had known. Even the cheap curates, she
      incidentally learned, were almost always young men of family, and Mr.
      Middleton, the actual curate, was said to be quite an acquisition: it was
      only a pity he was so soon to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one point which she was so anxious to gain that she could
      not allow the evening to pass without taking her measures toward securing
      it. Her mamma, she knew, intended to submit entirely to her uncle&rsquo;s
      judgment with regard to expenditure; and the submission was not merely
      prudential, for Mrs. Davilow, conscious that she had always been seen
      under a cloud as poor dear Fanny, who had made a sad blunder with her
      second marriage, felt a hearty satisfaction in being frankly and cordially
      identified with her sister&rsquo;s family, and in having her affairs
      canvassed and managed with an authority which presupposed a genuine
      interest. Thus the question of a suitable saddle-horse, which had been
      sufficiently discussed with mamma, had to be referred to Mr. Gascoigne;
      and after Gwendolen had played on the piano, which had been provided from
      Wanchester, had sung to her hearers&rsquo; admiration, and had induced her
      uncle to join her in a duet&mdash;what more softening influence than this
      on any uncle who would have sung finely if his time had not been too much
      taken up by graver matters?&mdash;she seized the opportune moment for
      saying, &ldquo;Mamma, you have not spoken to my uncle about my riding.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gwendolen desires above all things to have a horse to ride&mdash;a
      pretty, light, lady&rsquo;s horse,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, looking at
      Mr. Gascoigne. &ldquo;Do you think we can manage it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gascoigne projected his lower lip and lifted his handsome eyebrows
      sarcastically at Gwendolen, who had seated herself with much grace on the
      elbow of her mamma&rsquo;s chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could lend her the pony sometimes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gascoigne,
      watching her husband&rsquo;s face, and feeling quite ready to disapprove
      if he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might be inconveniencing others, aunt, and would be no
      pleasure to me. I cannot endure ponies,&rdquo; said Gwendolen. &ldquo;I
      would rather give up some other indulgence and have a horse.&rdquo; (Was
      there ever a young lady or gentleman not ready to give up an unspecified
      indulgence for the sake of the favorite one specified?)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She rides so well. She has had lessons, and the riding-master said
      she had so good a seat and hand she might be trusted with any mount,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Davilow, who, even if she had not wished her darling to have the
      horse, would not have dared to be lukewarm in trying to get it for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the price of the horse&mdash;a good sixty with the best
      chance, and then his keep,&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne, in a tone which,
      though demurring, betrayed the inward presence of something that favored
      the demand. &ldquo;There are the carriage-horses&mdash;already a heavy
      item. And remember what you ladies cost in toilet now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really wear nothing but two black dresses,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow, hastily. &ldquo;And the younger girls, of course, require no
      toilet at present. Besides, Gwendolen will save me so much by giving her
      sisters lessons.&rdquo; Here Mrs. Davilow&rsquo;s delicate cheek showed a
      rapid blush. &ldquo;If it were not for that, I must really have a more
      expensive governess, and masters besides.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen felt some anger with her mamma, but carefully concealed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is good&mdash;that is decidedly good,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Gascoigne, heartily, looking at his wife. And Gwendolen, who, it must be
      owned, was a deep young lady, suddenly moved away to the other end of the
      long drawing-room, and busied herself with arranging pieces of music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dear child has had no indulgences, no pleasures,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Davilow, in a pleading undertone. &ldquo;I feel the expense is rather
      imprudent in this first year of our settling. But she really needs the
      exercise&mdash;she needs cheering. And if you were to see her on
      horseback, it is something splendid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is what we could not afford for Anna,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Gascoigne. &ldquo;But she, dear child, would ride Lotta&rsquo;s donkey and
      think it good enough.&rdquo; (Anna was absorbed in a game with Isabel, who
      had hunted out an old back-gammon-board, and had begged to sit up an extra
      hour.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, a fine woman never looks better than on horseback,&rdquo;
      said Mr. Gascoigne. &ldquo;And Gwendolen has the figure for it. I don&rsquo;t
      say the thing should not be considered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might try it for a time, at all events. It can be given up, if
      necessary,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will consult Lord Brackenshaw&rsquo;s head groom. He is my
      <i>fidus Achates</i> in the horsey way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, much relieved. &ldquo;You are
      very kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he always is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gascoigne. And later that
      night, when she and her husband were in private, she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were almost too indulgent about the horse for
      Gwendolen. She ought not to claim so much more than your own daughter
      would think of. Especially before we see how Fanny manages on her income.
      And you really have enough to do without taking all this trouble on
      yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Nancy, one must look at things from every point of view.
      This girl is really worth some expense: you don&rsquo;t often see her
      equal. She ought to make a first-rate marriage, and I should not be doing
      my duty if I spared my trouble in helping her forward. You know yourself
      she has been under a disadvantage with such a father-in-law, and a second
      family, keeping her always in the shade. I feel for the girl, And I should
      like your sister and her family now to have the benefit of your having
      married rather a better specimen of our kind than she did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather better! I should think so. However, it is for me to be
      grateful that you will take so much on your shoulders for the sake of my
      sister and her children. I am sure I would not grudge anything to poor
      Fanny. But there is one thing I have been thinking of, though you have
      never mentioned it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boys. I hope they will not be falling in love with Gwendolen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t presuppose anything of the kind, my dear, and there
      will be no danger. Rex will never be at home for long together, and Warham
      is going to India. It is the wiser plan to take it for granted that
      cousins will not fall in love. If you begin with precautions, the affair
      will come in spite of them. One must not undertake to act for Providence
      in these matters, which can no more be held under the hand than a brood of
      chickens. The boys will have nothing, and Gwendolen will have nothing.
      They can&rsquo;t marry. At the worst there would only be a little crying,
      and you can&rsquo;t save boys and girls from that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gascoigne&rsquo;s mind was satisfied: if anything did happen, there
      was the comfort of feeling that her husband would know what was to be
      done, and would have the energy to do it.

</pre>
    <p>
      It would be a little hard to blame the rector of Pennicote that in the
      course of looking at things from every point of view, he looked at
      Gwendolen as a girl likely to make a brilliant marriage. Why should he be
      expected to differ from his contemporaries in this matter, and wish his
      niece a worse end of her charming maidenhood than they would approve as
      the best possible? It is rather to be set down to his credit that his
      feelings on the subject were entirely good-natured. And in considering the
      relation of means to ends, it would have been mere folly to have been
      guided by the exceptional and idyllic&mdash;to have recommended that
      Gwendolen should wear a gown as shabby as Griselda&rsquo;s in order that a
      marquis might fall in love with her, or to have insisted that since a fair
      maiden was to be sought, she should keep herself out of the way. Mr.
      Gascoigne&rsquo;s calculations were of the kind called rational, and he
      did not even think of getting a too frisky horse in order that Gwendolen
      might be threatened with an accident and be rescued by a man of property.
      He wished his niece well, and he meant her to be seen to advantage in the
      best society of the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle&rsquo;s intention fell in perfectly with Gwendolen&rsquo;s own
      wishes. But let no one suppose that she also contemplated a brilliant
      marriage as the direct end of her witching the world with her grace on
      horseback, or with any other accomplishment. That she was to be married
      some time or other she would have felt obliged to admit; and that her
      marriage would not be of a middling kind, such as most girls were
      contented with, she felt quietly, unargumentatively sure. But her thoughts
      never dwelt on marriage as the fulfillment of her ambition; the dramas in
      which she imagined herself a heroine were not wrought up to that close. To
      be very much sued or hopelessly sighed for as a bride was indeed an
      indispensable and agreeable guarantee of womanly power; but to become a
      wife and wear all the domestic fetters of that condition, was on the whole
      a vexatious necessity. Her observation of matrimony had inclined her to
      think it rather a dreary state in which a woman could not do what she
      liked, had more children than were desirable, was consequently dull, and
      became irrevocably immersed in humdrum. Of course marriage was social
      promotion; she could not look forward to a single life; but promotions
      have sometimes to be taken with bitter herbs&mdash;a peerage will not
      quite do instead of leadership to the man who meant to lead; and this
      delicate-limbed sylph of twenty meant to lead. For such passions dwell in
      feminine breasts also. In Gwendolen&rsquo;s, however, they dwelt among
      strictly feminine furniture, and had no disturbing reference to the
      advancement of learning or the balance of the constitution; her knowledge
      being such as with no sort of standing-room or length of lever could have
      been expected to move the world. She meant to do what was pleasant to
      herself in a striking manner; or rather, whatever she could do so as to
      strike others with admiration and get in that reflected way a more ardent
      sense of living, seemed pleasant to her fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gwendolen will not rest without having the world at her feet,&rdquo;
      said Miss Merry, the meek governess: hyperbolical words which have long
      come to carry the most moderate meanings; for who has not heard of private
      persons having the world at their feet in the shape of some half-dozen
      items of flattering regard generally known in a genteel suburb? And words
      could hardly be too wide or vague to indicate the prospect that made a
      hazy largeness about poor Gwendolen on the heights of her young
      self-exultation. Other people allowed themselves to be made slaves of, and
      to have their lives blown hither and thither like empty ships in which no
      will was present. It was not to be so with her; she would no longer be
      sacrificed to creatures worth less than herself, but would make the very
      best of the chances that life offered her, and conquer circumstances by
      her exceptional cleverness. Certainly, to be settled at Offendene, with
      the notice of Lady Brackenshaw, the archery club, and invitations to dine
      with the Arrowpoints, as the highest lights in her scenery, was not a
      position that seemed to offer remarkable chances; but Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      confidence lay chiefly in herself. She felt well equipped for the mastery
      of life. With regard to much in her lot hitherto, she held herself rather
      hardly dealt with, but as to her &ldquo;education,&rdquo; she would have
      admitted that it had left her under no disadvantages. In the school-room
      her quick mind had taken readily that strong starch of unexplained rules
      and disconnected facts which saves ignorance from any painful sense of
      limpness; and what remained of all things knowable, she was conscious of
      being sufficiently acquainted with through novels, plays and poems. About
      her French and music, the two justifying accomplishments of a young lady,
      she felt no ground for uneasiness; and when to all these qualifications,
      negative and positive, we add the spontaneous sense of capability some
      happy persons are born with, so that any subject they turn their attention
      to impresses them with their own power of forming a correct judgment on
      it, who can wonder if Gwendolen felt ready to manage her own destiny?
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many subjects in the world&mdash;perhaps the majority&mdash;in
      which she felt no interest, because they were stupid; for subjects are apt
      to appear stupid to the young as light seems dull to the old; but she
      would not have felt at all helpless in relation to them if they had turned
      up in conversation. It must be remembered that no one had disputed her
      power or her general superiority. As on the arrival at Offendene, so
      always, the first thought of those about her had been, what will Gwendolen
      think?&mdash;if the footman trod heavily in creaking boots, or if the
      laundress&rsquo;s work was unsatisfactory, the maid said, &ldquo;This will
      never do for Miss Harleth&rdquo;; if the wood smoked in the bedroom
      fireplace, Mrs. Davilow, whose own weak eyes suffered much from this
      inconvenience, spoke apologetically of it to Gwendolen. If, when they were
      under the stress of traveling, she did not appear at the breakfast table
      till every one else had finished, the only question was, how Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      coffee and toast should still be of the hottest and crispest; and when she
      appeared with her freshly-brushed light-brown hair streaming backward and
      awaiting her mamma&rsquo;s hand to coil it up, her large brown eyes
      glancing bright as a wave-washed onyx from under their long lashes, it was
      always she herself who had to be tolerant&mdash;to beg that Alice who sat
      waiting on her would not stick up her shoulders in that frightful manner,
      and that Isabel, instead of pushing up to her and asking questions, would
      go away to Miss Merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always she was the princess in exile, who in time of famine was to have
      her breakfast-roll made of the finest-bolted flour from the seven thin
      ears of wheat, and in a general decampment was to have her silver fork
      kept out of the baggage. How was this to be accounted for? The answer may
      seem to lie quite on the surface:&mdash;in her beauty, a certain
      unusualness about her, a decision of will which made itself felt in her
      graceful movements and clear unhesitating tones, so that if she came into
      the room on a rainy day when everybody else was flaccid and the use of
      things in general was not apparent to them, there seemed to be a sudden,
      sufficient reason for keeping up the forms of life; and even the waiters
      at hotels showed the more alacrity in doing away with crumbs and creases
      and dregs with struggling flies in them. This potent charm, added to the
      fact that she was the eldest daughter, toward whom her mamma had always
      been in an apologetic state of mind for the evils brought on her by a
      step-father, may seem so full a reason for Gwendolen&rsquo;s domestic
      empire, that to look for any other would be to ask the reason of daylight
      when the sun is shining. But beware of arriving at conclusions without
      comparison. I remember having seen the same assiduous, apologetic
      attention awarded to persons who were not at all beautiful or unusual,
      whose firmness showed itself in no very graceful or euphonious way, and
      who were not eldest daughters with a tender, timid mother, compunctious at
      having subjected them to inconveniences. Some of them were a very common
      sort of men. And the only point of resemblance among them all was a strong
      determination to have what was pleasant, with a total fearlessness in
      making themselves disagreeable or dangerous when they did not get it. Who
      is so much cajoled and served with trembling by the weak females of a
      household as the unscrupulous male&mdash;capable, if he has not free way
      at home, of going and doing worse elsewhere? Hence I am forced to doubt
      whether even without her potent charm and peculiar filial position
      Gwendolen might not still have played the queen in exile, if only she had
      kept her inborn energy of egoistic desire, and her power of inspiring fear
      as to what she might say or do. However, she had the charm, and those who
      feared her were also fond of her; the fear and the fondness being perhaps
      both heightened by what may be called the iridescence of her character&mdash;the
      play of various, nay, contrary tendencies. For Macbeth&rsquo;s rhetoric
      about the impossibility of being many opposite things in the same moment,
      referred to the clumsy necessities of action and not to the subtler
      possibilities of feeling. We cannot speak a loyal word and be meanly
      silent; we cannot kill and not kill in the same moment; but a moment is
      wide enough for the loyal and mean desire, for the outlash of a murderous
      thought and the sharp backward stroke of repentance.

      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                              &ldquo;Her wit
  Values itself so highly, that to her
  All matter else seems weak.&rdquo;
            &mdash;<i>Much Ado About Nothing.</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s reception in the neighborhood fulfilled her uncle&rsquo;s
      expectations. From Brackenshaw Castle to the Firs at Wanchester, where Mr.
      Quallon the banker kept a generous house, she was welcomed with manifest
      admiration, and even those ladies who did not quite like her, felt a
      comfort in having a new, striking girl to invite; for hostesses who
      entertain much must make up their parties as ministers make up their
      cabinets, on grounds other than personal liking. Then, in order to have
      Gwendolen as a guest, it was not necessary to ask any one who was
      disagreeable, for Mrs. Davilow always made a quiet, picturesque figure as
      a chaperon, and Mr. Gascoigne was everywhere in request for his own sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the houses where Gwendolen was not quite liked, and yet invited, was
      Quetcham Hall. One of her first invitations was to a large dinner-party
      there, which made a sort of general introduction for her to the society of
      the neighborhood; for in a select party of thirty and of well-composed
      proportions as to age, few visitable families could be entirely left out.
      No youthful figure there was comparable to Gwendolen&rsquo;s as she passed
      through the long suite of rooms adorned with light and flowers, and,
      visible at first as a slim figure floating along in white drapery,
      approached through one wide doorway after another into fuller illumination
      and definiteness. She had never had that sort of promenade before, and she
      felt exultingly that it befitted her: any one looking at her for the first
      time might have supposed that long galleries and lackeys had always been a
      matter of course in her life; while her cousin Anna, who was really more
      familiar with these things, felt almost as much embarrassed as a rabbit
      suddenly deposited in that well-lit-space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that with Gascoigne?&rdquo; said the archdeacon, neglecting
      a discussion of military manoeuvres on which, as a clergyman, he was
      naturally appealed to. And his son, on the other side of the room&mdash;a
      hopeful young scholar, who had already suggested some &ldquo;not less
      elegant than ingenious,&rdquo; emendations of Greek texts&mdash;said
      nearly at the same time, &ldquo;By George! who is that girl with the
      awfully well-set head and jolly figure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But to a mind of general benevolence, wishing everybody to look well, it
      was rather exasperating to see how Gwendolen eclipsed others: how even the
      handsome Miss Lawe, explained to be the daughter of Lady Lawe, looked
      suddenly broad, heavy and inanimate; and how Miss Arrowpoint,
      unfortunately also dressed in white, immediately resembled a <i>carte-de-visite</i>
      in which one would fancy the skirt alone to have been charged for. Since
      Miss Arrowpoint was generally liked for the amiable unpretending way in
      which she wore her fortunes, and made a softening screen for the oddities
      of her mother, there seemed to be some unfitness in Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      looking so much more like a person of social importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not really so handsome if you come to examine her features,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Arrowpoint, later in the evening, confidentially to Mrs.
      Vulcany. &ldquo;It is a certain style she has, which produces a great
      effect at first, but afterward she is less agreeable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Gwendolen, not intending it, but intending the contrary, had
      offended her hostess, who, though not a splenetic or vindictive woman, had
      her susceptibilities. Several conditions had met in the Lady of Quetcham
      which to the reasoners in that neighborhood seemed to have an essential
      connection with each other. It was occasionally recalled that she had been
      the heiress of a fortune gained by some moist or dry business in the city,
      in order fully to account for her having a squat figure, a harsh
      parrot-like voice, and a systematically high head-dress; and since these
      points made her externally rather ridiculous, it appeared to many only
      natural that she should have what are called literary tendencies. A little
      comparison would have shown that all these points are to be found apart;
      daughters of aldermen being often well-grown and well-featured, pretty
      women having sometimes harsh or husky voices, and the production of feeble
      literature being found compatible with the most diverse forms of <i>physique</i>,
      masculine as well as feminine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen, who had a keen sense of absurdity in others, but was kindly
      disposed toward any one who could make life agreeable to her, meant to win
      Mrs. Arrowpoint by giving her an interest and attention beyond what others
      were probably inclined to show. But self-confidence is apt to address
      itself to an imaginary dullness in others; as people who are well off
      speak in a cajoling tone to the poor, and those who are in the prime of
      life raise their voice and talk artificially to seniors, hastily
      conceiving them to be deaf and rather imbecile. Gwendolen, with all her
      cleverness and purpose to be agreeable, could not escape that form of
      stupidity: it followed in her mind, unreflectingly, that because Mrs.
      Arrowpoint was ridiculous she was also likely to be wanting in
      penetration, and she went through her little scenes without suspicion that
      the various shades of her behavior were all noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are fond of books as well as of music, riding, and archery, I
      hear,&rdquo; Mrs. Arrowpoint said, going to her for a <i>tete-à-tete</i>
      in the drawing-room after dinner. &ldquo;Catherine will be very glad to
      have so sympathetic a neighbor.&rdquo; This little speech might have
      seemed the most graceful politeness, spoken in a low, melodious tone; but
      with a twang, fatally loud, it gave Gwendolen a sense of exercising
      patronage when she answered, gracefully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I who am fortunate. Miss Arrowpoint will teach me what good
      music is. I shall be entirely a learner. I hear that she is a thorough
      musician.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catherine has certainly had every advantage. We have a first-rate
      musician in the house now&mdash;Herr Klesmer; perhaps you know all his
      compositions. You must allow me to introduce him to you. You sing, I
      believe. Catherine plays three instruments, but she does not sing. I hope
      you will let us hear you. I understand you are an accomplished singer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&mdash;&lsquo;die Kraft ist schwach, allein die Lust ist
      gross,&rsquo; as Mephistopheles says.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are a student of Goethe. Young ladies are so advanced now.
      I suppose you have read everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really. I shall be so glad if you will tell me what to read. I
      have been looking into all the books in the library at Offendene, but
      there is nothing readable. The leaves all stick together and smell musty.
      I wish I could write books to amuse myself, as you can! How delightful it
      must be to write books after one&rsquo;s own taste instead of reading
      other people&rsquo;s! Home-made books must be so nice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Mrs. Arrowpoint&rsquo;s glance was a little sharper, but
      the perilous resemblance to satire in the last sentence took the hue of
      girlish simplicity when Gwendolen added,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would give anything to write a book!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should you not?&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint, encouragingly.
      &ldquo;You have but to begin as I did. Pen, ink, and paper are at
      everybody&rsquo;s command. But I will send you all I have written with
      pleasure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. I shall be so glad to read your writings. Being acquainted
      with authors must give a peculiar understanding of their books: one would
      be able to tell then which parts were funny and which serious. I am sure I
      often laugh in the wrong place.&rdquo; Here Gwendolen herself became aware
      of danger, and added quickly, &ldquo;In Shakespeare, you know, and other
      great writers that we can never see. But I always want to know more than
      there is in the books.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are interested in any of my subjects I can lend you many
      extra sheets in manuscript,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint&mdash;while
      Gwendolen felt herself painfully in the position of the young lady who
      professed to like potted sprats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are things I dare say I shall publish eventually: several
      friends have urged me to do so, and one doesn&rsquo;t like to be
      obstinate. My Tasso, for example&mdash;I could have made it twice the
      size.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dote on Tasso,&rdquo; said Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you shall have all my papers, if you like. So many, you know,
      have written about Tasso; but they are all wrong. As to the particular
      nature of his madness, and his feelings for Leonora, and the real cause of
      his imprisonment, and the character of Leonora, who, in my opinion, was a
      cold-hearted woman, else she would have married him in spite of her
      brother&mdash;they are all wrong. I differ from everybody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very interesting!&rdquo; said Gwendolen. &ldquo;I like to
      differ from everybody. I think it is so stupid to agree. That is the worst
      of writing your opinions; you make people agree with you.&rdquo; This
      speech renewed a slight suspicion in Mrs. Arrowpoint, and again her glance
      became for a moment examining. But Gwendolen looked very innocent, and
      continued with a docile air:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of Tasso except the <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i>,
      which we read and learned by heart at school.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, his life is more interesting than his poetry, I have
      constructed the early part of his life as a sort of romance. When one
      thinks of his father Bernardo, and so on, there is much that must be true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imagination is often truer than fact,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      decisively, though she could no more have explained these glib words than
      if they had been Coptic or Etruscan. &ldquo;I shall be so glad to learn
      all about Tasso&mdash;and his madness especially. I suppose poets are
      always a little mad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure&mdash;&lsquo;the poet&rsquo;s eye in a fine frenzy
      rolling&rsquo;; and somebody says of Marlowe,

  &lsquo;For that fine madness still he did maintain,
  Which always should possess the poet&rsquo;s brain.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was not always found out, was it?&rdquo; said Gwendolen
      innocently. &ldquo;I suppose some of them rolled their eyes in private.
      Mad people are often very cunning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a shade flitted over Mrs. Arrowpoint&rsquo;s face; but the entrance
      of the gentlemen prevented any immediate mischief between her and this too
      quick young lady, who had over-acted her <i>naïveté</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, here comes Herr Klesmer,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint, rising;
      and presently bringing him to Gwendolen, she left them to a dialogue which
      was agreeable on both sides, Herr Klesmer being a felicitous combination
      of the German, the Sclave and the Semite, with grand features, brown hair
      floating in artistic fashion, and brown eyes in spectacles. His English
      had little foreignness except its fluency; and his alarming cleverness was
      made less formidable just then by a certain softening air of silliness
      which will sometimes befall even Genius in the desire of being agreeable
      to Beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Music was soon begun. Miss Arrowpoint and Herr Klesmer played a
      four-handed piece on two pianos, which convinced the company in general
      that it was long, and Gwendolen in particular that the neutral,
      placid-faced Miss Arrowpoint had a mastery of the instrument which put her
      own execution out of question&mdash;though she was not discouraged as to
      her often-praised touch and style. After this every one became anxious to
      hear Gwendolen sing; especially Mr. Arrowpoint; as was natural in a host
      and a perfect gentleman, of whom no one had anything to say but that he
      married Miss Cuttler and imported the best cigars; and he led her to the
      piano with easy politeness. Herr Klesmer closed the instrument in
      readiness for her, and smiled with pleasure at her approach; then placed
      himself at a distance of a few feet so that he could see her as she sang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen was not nervous; what she undertook to do she did without
      trembling, and singing was an enjoyment to her. Her voice was a moderately
      powerful soprano (some one had told her it was like Jenny Lind&rsquo;s),
      her ear good, and she was able to keep in tune, so that her singing gave
      pleasure to ordinary hearers, and she had been used to unmingled applause.
      She had the rare advantage of looking almost prettier when she was singing
      than at other times, and that Herr Klesmer was in front of her seemed not
      disagreeable. Her song, determined on beforehand, was a favorite aria of
      Belini&rsquo;s, in which she felt quite sure of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; said Mr. Arrowpoint, who had remained near, and
      the word was echoed around without more insincerity than we recognize in a
      brotherly way as human. But Herr Klesmer stood like a statue&mdash;if a
      statue can be imagined in spectacles; at least, he was as mute as a
      statue. Gwendolen was pressed to keep her seat and double the general
      pleasure, and she did not wish to refuse; but before resolving to do so,
      she moved a little toward Herr Klesmer, saying with a look of smiling
      appeal, &ldquo;It would be too cruel to a great musician. You cannot like
      to hear poor amateur singing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, truly; but that makes nothing,&rdquo; said Herr Klesmer,
      suddenly speaking in an odious German fashion with staccato endings, quite
      unobservable in him before, and apparently depending on a change of mood,
      as Irishmen resume their strongest brogue when they are fervid or
      quarrelsome. &ldquo;That makes nothing. It is always acceptable to see you
      sing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there ever so unexpected an assertion of superiority&mdash;at least
      before the late Teutonic conquest? Gwendolen colored deeply, but, with her
      usual presence of mind, did not show an ungraceful resentment by moving
      away immediately; and Miss Arrowpoint, who had been near enough to
      overhear (and also to observe that Herr Klesmer&rsquo;s mode of looking at
      Gwendolen was more conspicuously admiring than was quite consistent with
      good taste), now with the utmost tact and kindness came close to her and
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imagine what I have to go through with this professor! He can
      hardly tolerate anything we English do in music. We can only put up with
      his severity, and make use of it to find out the worst that can be said of
      us. It is a little comfort to know that; and one can bear it when every
      one else is admiring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very much obliged to him for telling me the worst,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, recovering herself. &ldquo;I dare say I have been
      extremely ill taught, in addition to having no talent&mdash;only liking
      for music.&rdquo; This was very well expressed considering that it had
      never entered her mind before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is true: you have not been well taught,&rdquo; said Herr
      Klesmer, quietly. Woman was dear to him, but music was dearer. &ldquo;Still,
      you are not quite without gifts. You sing in tune, and you have a pretty
      fair organ. But you produce your notes badly; and that music which you
      sing is beneath you. It is a form of melody which expresses a puerile
      state of culture&mdash;a dawdling, canting, see-saw kind of stuff&mdash;the
      passion and thought of people without any breadth of horizon. There is a
      sort of self-satisfied folly about every phrase of such melody; no cries
      of deep, mysterious passion&mdash;no conflict&mdash;no sense of the
      universal. It makes men small as they listen to it. Sing now something
      larger. And I shall see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not now&mdash;by-and-by,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a sinking
      of heart at the sudden width of horizon opened round her small musical
      performance. For a lady desiring to lead, this first encounter in her
      campaign was startling. But she was bent on not behaving foolishly, and
      Miss Arrowpoint helped her by saying, &ldquo;Yes, by-and-by. I always
      require half an hour to get up my courage after being criticised by Herr
      Klesmer. We will ask him to play to us now: he is bound to show us what is
      good music.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To be quite safe on this point Herr Klesmer played a composition of his
      own, a fantasia called <i>Freudvoll, Leidvoll, Gedankenvoll</i>&mdash;an
      extensive commentary on some melodic ideas not too grossly evident; and he
      certainly fetched as much variety and depth of passion out of the piano as
      that moderately responsive instrument lends itself to, having an imperious
      magic in his fingers that seem to send a nerve-thrill through ivory key
      and wooden hammer, and compel the strings to make a quivering lingering
      speech for him. Gwendolen, in spite of her wounded egoism, had fullness of
      nature enough to feel the power of this playing, and it gradually turned
      her inward sob of mortification into an excitement which lifted her for
      the moment into a desperate indifference about her own doings, or at least
      a determination to get a superiority over them by laughing at them as if
      they belonged to somebody else. Her eyes had become brighter, her cheeks
      slightly flushed, and her tongue ready for any mischievous remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would sing to us again, Miss Harleth,&rdquo; said young
      Clintock, the archdeacon&rsquo;s classical son, who had been so fortunate
      as to take her to dinner, and came up to renew conversation as soon as
      Herr Klesmer&rsquo;s performance was ended, &ldquo;That is the style of
      music for me. I never can make anything of this tip-top playing. It is
      like a jar of leeches, where you can never tell either beginnings or
      endings. I could listen to your singing all day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we should be glad of something popular now&mdash;another song
      from you would be a relaxation,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint, who had also
      come near with polite intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be because you are in a puerile state of culture, and
      have no breadth of horizon. I have just learned that. I have been taught
      how bad my taste is, and am feeling growing pains. They are never
      pleasant,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, not taking any notice of Mrs. Arrowpoint,
      and looking up with a bright smile at young Clintock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arrowpoint was not insensible to this rudeness, but merely said,
      &ldquo;Well, we will not press anything disagreeably,&rdquo; and as there
      was a perceptible outburst of imprisoned conversation just then, and a
      movement of guests seeking each other, she remained seated where she was,
      and looked around her with the relief of a hostess at finding she is not
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you like this neighborhood,&rdquo; said young Clintock,
      well-pleased with his station in front of Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exceedingly. There seems to be a little of everything and not much
      of anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is rather equivocal praise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with me. I like a little of everything; a little absurdity, for
      example, is very amusing. I am thankful for a few queer people; but much
      of them is a bore.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Mrs. Arrowpoint, who was hearing this dialogue, perceived quite a new
      tone in Gwendolen&rsquo;s speech, and felt a revival of doubt as to her
      interest in Tasso&rsquo;s madness.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there should be more croquet, for one thing,&rdquo; said
      young Clintock; &ldquo;I am usually away, but if I were more here I should
      go in for a croquet club. You are one of the archers, I think. But depend
      upon it croquet is the game of the future. It wants writing up, though.
      One of our best men has written a poem on it, in four cantos;&mdash;as
      good as Pope. I want him to publish it&mdash;You never read anything
      better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall study croquet to-morrow. I shall take to it instead of
      singing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, not that; but do take to croquet. I will send you Jenning&rsquo;s
      poem if you like. I have a manuscript copy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a great friend of yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, rather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if he is only rather, I think I will decline. Or, if you send
      it to me, will you promise not to catechise me upon it and ask me which
      part I like best? Because it is not so easy to know a poem without reading
      it as to know a sermon without listening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo; Mrs. Arrowpoint thought, &ldquo;this girl is
      double and satirical. I shall be on my guard against her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gwendolen, nevertheless, continued to receive polite attentions from
      the family at Quetcham, not merely because invitations have larger grounds
      than those of personal liking, but because the trying little scene at the
      piano had awakened a kindly solicitude toward her in the gentle mind of
      Miss Arrowpoint, who managed all the invitations and visits, her mother
      being otherwise occupied.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Croyez-vous m&rsquo;avoir humiliée pour m&rsquo;avoir appris que la terre tourne
    autour du soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m&rsquo;en estime pas moins.&rdquo;
                                 &mdash;FONTENELLE: <i>Pluralité des Mondes</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      That lofty criticism had caused Gwendolen a new sort of pain. She would
      not have chosen to confess how unfortunate she thought herself in not
      having had Miss Arrowpoint&rsquo;s musical advantages, so as to be able to
      question Herr Klesmer&rsquo;s taste with the confidence of thorough
      knowledge; still less, to admit even to herself that Miss Arrowpoint each
      time they met raised an unwonted feeling of jealousy in her: not in the
      least because she was an heiress, but because it was really provoking that
      a girl whose appearance you could not characterize except by saying that
      her figure was slight and of middle stature, her features small, her eyes
      tolerable, and her complexion sallow, had nevertheless a certain mental
      superiority which could not be explained away&mdash;an exasperating
      thoroughness in her musical accomplishment, a fastidious discrimination in
      her general tastes, which made it impossible to force her admiration and
      kept you in awe of her standard. This insignificant-looking young lady of
      four-and-twenty, whom any one&rsquo;s eyes would have passed over
      negligently if she had not been Miss Arrowpoint, might be suspected of a
      secret opinion that Miss Harleth&rsquo;s acquirements were rather of a
      common order, and such an opinion was not made agreeable to think of by
      being always veiled under a perfect kindness of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gwendolen did not like to dwell on facts which threw an unfavorable
      light on itself. The musical Magus who had so suddenly widened her horizon
      was not always on the scene; and his being constantly backward and forward
      between London and Quetcham soon began to be thought of as offering
      opportunities for converting him to a more admiring state of mind.
      Meanwhile, in the manifest pleasure her singing gave at Brackenshaw
      Castle, the Firs, and elsewhere, she recovered her equanimity, being
      disposed to think approval more trustworthy than objection, and not being
      one of the exceptional persons who have a parching thirst for a perfection
      undemanded by their neighbors. Perhaps it would have been rash to say then
      that she was at all exceptional inwardly, or that the unusual in her was
      more than her rare grace of movement and bearing, and a certain daring
      which gave piquancy to a very common egoistic ambition, such as exists
      under many clumsy exteriors and is taken no notice of. For I suppose that
      the set of the head does not really determine the hunger of the inner self
      for supremacy: it only makes a difference sometimes as to the way in which
      the supremacy is held attainable, and a little also to the degree in which
      it can be attained; especially when the hungry one is a girl, whose
      passion for doing what is remarkable has an ideal limit in consistency
      with the highest breeding and perfect freedom from the sordid need of
      income. Gwendolen was as inwardly rebellious against the restraints of
      family conditions, and as ready to look through obligations into her own
      fundamental want of feeling for them, as if she had been sustained by the
      boldest speculations; but she really had no such speculations, and would
      at once have marked herself off from any sort of theoretical or
      practically reforming women by satirizing them. She rejoiced to feel
      herself exceptional; but her horizon was that of the genteel romance where
      the heroine&rsquo;s soul poured out in her journal is full of vague power,
      originality, and general rebellion, while her life moves strictly in the
      sphere of fashion; and if she wanders into a swamp, the pathos lies
      partly, so to speak, in her having on her satin shoes. Here is a restraint
      which nature and society have provided on the pursuit of striking
      adventure; so that a soul burning with a sense of what the universe is
      not, and ready to take all existence as fuel, is nevertheless held captive
      by the ordinary wirework of social forms and does nothing particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      This commonplace result was what Gwendolen found herself threatened with
      even in the novelty of the first winter at Offendene. What she was clear
      upon was, that she did not wish to lead the same sort of life as ordinary
      young ladies did; but what she was not clear upon was, how she should set
      about leading any other, and what were the particular acts which she would
      assert her freedom by doing. Offendene remained a good background, if
      anything would happen there; but on the whole the neighborhood was in
      fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the effect of her beauty on a first presentation, there was not
      much excitement to be got out of her earliest invitations, and she came
      home after little sallies of satire and knowingness, such as had offended
      Mrs. Arrowpoint, to fill the intervening days with the most girlish
      devices. The strongest assertion she was able to make of her individual
      claims was to leave out Alice&rsquo;s lessons (on the principle that Alice
      was more likely to excel in ignorance), and to employ her with Miss Merry,
      and the maid who was understood to wait on all the ladies, in helping to
      arrange various dramatic costumes which Gwendolen pleased herself with
      having in readiness for some future occasions of acting in charades or
      theatrical pieces, occasions which she meant to bring about by force of
      will or contrivance. She had never acted&mdash;only made a figure in <i>tableaux
      vivans</i> at school; but she felt assured that she could act well, and
      having been once or twice to the Théâtre Français, and also heard her
      mamma speak of Rachel, her waking dreams and cogitations as to how she
      would manage her destiny sometimes turned on the question whether she
      would become an actress like Rachel, since she was more beautiful than
      that thin Jewess. Meanwhile the wet days before Christmas were passed
      pleasantly in the preparation of costumes, Greek, Oriental, and Composite,
      in which Gwendolen attitudinized and speechified before a domestic
      audience, including even the housekeeper, who was once pressed into it
      that she might swell the notes of applause; but having shown herself
      unworthy by observing that Miss Harleth looked far more like a queen in
      her own dress than in that baggy thing with her arms all bare, she was not
      invited a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I look as well as Rachel, mamma?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, one day
      when she had been showing herself in her Greek dress to Anna, and going
      through scraps of scenes with much tragic intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have better arms than Rachel,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, &ldquo;your
      arms would do for anything, Gwen. But your voice is not so tragic as hers;
      it is not so deep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can make it deeper, if I like,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      provisionally; then she added, with decision, &ldquo;I think a higher
      voice is more tragic: it is more feminine; and the more feminine a woman
      is, the more tragic it seems when she does desperate actions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be something in that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow,
      languidly. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know what good there is in making one&rsquo;s
      blood creep. And if there is anything horrible to be done, I should like
      it to be left to the men.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mamma, you are so dreadfully prosaic! As if all the great
      poetic criminals were not women! I think the men are poor cautious
      creatures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear, and you&mdash;who are afraid to be alone in the night&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t think you would be very bold in crime, thank God.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not talking about reality, mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      impatiently. Then her mamma being called out of the room, she turned
      quickly to her cousin, as if taking an opportunity, and said, &ldquo;Anna,
      do ask my uncle to let us get up some charades at the rectory. Mr.
      Middleton and Warham could act with us&mdash;just for practice. Mamma says
      it will not do to have Mr. Middleton consulting and rehearsing here. He is
      a stick, but we could give him suitable parts. Do ask, or else I will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not till Rex comes. He is so clever, and such a dear old thing,
      and he will act Napoleon looking over the sea. He looks just like
      Napoleon. Rex can do anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t in the least believe in your Rex, Anna,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, laughing at her. &ldquo;He will turn out to be like those
      wretched blue and yellow water-colors of his which you hang up in your
      bedroom and worship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, you will see,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;It is not that I
      know what is clever, but he has got a scholarship already, and papa says
      he will get a fellowship, and nobody is better at games. He is cleverer
      than Mr. Middleton, and everybody but you call Mr. Middleton clever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he may be in a dark-lantern sort of way. But he <i>is</i> a
      stick. If he had to say, &lsquo;Perdition catch my soul, but I do love
      her,&rsquo; he would say it in just the same tone as, &lsquo;Here endeth
      the second lesson.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gwendolen!&rdquo; said Anna, shocked at these promiscuous
      allusions. &ldquo;And it is very unkind of you to speak so of him, for he
      admires you very much. I heard Warham say one day to mamma, &lsquo;Middleton
      is regularly spooney upon Gwendolen.&rsquo; She was very angry with him;
      but I know what it means. It is what they say at college for being in
      love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help it?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, rather contemptuously.
      &ldquo;Perdition catch my soul if I love <i>him</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course; papa, I think, would not wish it. And he is to go
      away soon. But it makes me sorry when you ridicule him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall you do to me when I ridicule Rex?&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      wickedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Gwendolen, dear, you <i>will not</i>?&rdquo; said Anna, her
      eyes filling with tears. &ldquo;I could not bear it. But there really is
      nothing in him to ridicule. Only you may find out things. For no one ever
      thought of laughing at Mr. Middleton before you. Every one said he was
      nice-looking, and his manners perfect. I am sure I have always been
      frightened at him because of his learning and his square-cut coat, and his
      being a nephew of the bishop&rsquo;s, and all that. But you will not
      ridicule Rex&mdash;promise me.&rdquo; Anna ended with a beseeching look
      which touched Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a dear little coz,&rdquo; she said, just touching the tip
      of Anna&rsquo;s chin with her thumb and forefinger. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      ever want to do anything that will vex you. Especially if Rex is to make
      everything come off&mdash;charades and everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And when at last Rex was there, the animation he brought into the life of
      Offendene and the rectory, and his ready partnership in Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      plans, left her no inclination for any ridicule that was not of an open
      and flattering kind, such as he himself enjoyed. He was a fine
      open-hearted youth, with a handsome face strongly resembling his father&rsquo;s
      and Anna&rsquo;s, but softer in expression than the one, and larger in
      scale than the other: a bright, healthy, loving nature, enjoying ordinary
      innocent things so much that vice had no temptation for him, and what he
      knew of it lay too entirely in the outer courts and little-visited
      chambers of his mind for him to think of it with great repulsion. Vicious
      habits were with him &ldquo;what some fellows did&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;stupid
      stuff&rdquo; which he liked to keep aloof from. He returned Anna&rsquo;s
      affection as fully as could be expected of a brother whose pleasures apart
      from her were more than the sum total of hers; and he had never known a
      stronger love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cousins were continually together at the one house or the other&mdash;chiefly
      at Offendene, where there was more freedom, or rather where there was a
      more complete sway for Gwendolen; and whatever she wished became a ruling
      purpose for Rex. The charades came off according to her plans; and also
      some other little scenes not contemplated by her in which her acting was
      more impromptu. It was at Offendene that the charades and <i>tableaux</i>
      were rehearsed and presented, Mrs. Davilow seeing no objection even to Mr.
      Middleton&rsquo;s being invited to share in them, now that Rex too was
      there&mdash;especially as his services were indispensable: Warham, who was
      studying for India with a Wanchester &ldquo;coach,&rdquo; having no time
      to spare, and being generally dismal under a cram of everything except the
      answers needed at the forthcoming examination, which might disclose the
      welfare of our Indian Empire to be somehow connected with a quotable
      knowledge of Browne&rsquo;s Pastorals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Middleton was persuaded to play various grave parts, Gwendolen having
      flattered him on his enviable immobility of countenance; and at first a
      little pained and jealous at her comradeship with Rex, he presently drew
      encouragement from the thought that this sort of cousinly familiarity
      excluded any serious passion. Indeed, he occasionally felt that her more
      formal treatment of himself was such a sign of favor as to warrant his
      making advances before he left Pennicote, though he had intended to keep
      his feelings in reserve until his position should be more assured. Miss
      Gwendolen, quite aware that she was adored by this unexceptionable young
      clergyman with pale whiskers and square-cut collar, felt nothing more on
      the subject than that she had no objection to being adored: she turned her
      eyes on him with calm mercilessness and caused him many mildly agitating
      hopes by seeming always to avoid dramatic contact with him&mdash;for all
      meanings, we know, depend on the key of interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some persons might have thought beforehand that a young man of Anglican
      leanings, having a sense of sacredness much exercised on small things as
      well as great, rarely laughing save from politeness, and in general
      regarding the mention of spades by their naked names as rather coarse,
      would not have seen a fitting bride for himself in a girl who was daring
      in ridicule, and showed none of the special grace required in the
      clergyman&rsquo;s wife; or, that a young man informed by theological
      reading would have reflected that he was not likely to meet the taste of a
      lively, restless young lady like Miss Harleth. But are we always obliged
      to explain why the facts are not what some persons thought beforehand? The
      apology lies on their side, who had that erroneous way of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Rex, who would possibly have been sorry for poor Middleton if he
      had been aware of the excellent curate&rsquo;s inward conflict, he was too
      completely absorbed in a first passion to have observation for any person
      or thing. He did not observe Gwendolen; he only felt what she said or did,
      and the back of his head seemed to be a good organ of information as to
      whether she was in the room or out. Before the end of the first fortnight
      he was so deeply in love that it was impossible for him to think of his
      life except as bound up with Gwendolen&rsquo;s. He could see no obstacles,
      poor boy; his own love seemed a guarantee of hers, since it was one with
      the unperturbed delight in her image, so that he could no more dream of
      her giving him pain than an Egyptian could dream of snow. She sang and
      played to him whenever he liked, was always glad of his companionship in
      riding, though his borrowed steeds were often comic, was ready to join in
      any fun of his, and showed a right appreciation of Anna. No mark of
      sympathy seemed absent. That because Gwendolen was the most perfect
      creature in the world she was to make a grand match, had not occurred to
      him. He had no conceit&mdash;at least not more than goes to make up the
      necessary gum and consistence of a substantial personality: it was only
      that in the young bliss of loving he took Gwendolen&rsquo;s perfection as
      part of that good which had seemed one with life to him, being the outcome
      of a happy, well-embodied nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      One incident which happened in the course of their dramatic attempts
      impressed Rex as a sign of her unusual sensibility. It showed an aspect of
      her nature which could not have been preconceived by any one who, like
      him, had only seen her habitual fearlessness in active exercises and her
      high spirits in society.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a good deal of rehearsing it was resolved that a select party should
      be invited to Offendene to witness the performances which went with so
      much satisfaction to the actors. Anna had caused a pleasant surprise;
      nothing could be neater than the way in which she played her little parts;
      one would even have suspected her of hiding much sly observation under her
      simplicity. And Mr. Middleton answered very well by not trying to be
      comic. The main source of doubt and retardation had been Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      desire to appear in her Greek dress. No word for a charade would occur to
      her either waking or dreaming that suited her purpose of getting a
      statuesque pose in this favorite costume. To choose a motive from Racine
      was of no use, since Rex and the others could not declaim French verse,
      and improvised speeches would turn the scene into burlesque. Besides, Mr.
      Gascoigne prohibited the acting of scenes from plays: he usually protested
      against the notion that an amusement which was fitting for every one else
      was unfitting for a clergyman; but he would not in this matter overstep
      the line of decorum as drawn in that part of Wessex, which did not exclude
      his sanction of the young people&rsquo;s acting charades in his
      sister-in-law&rsquo;s house&mdash;a very different affair from private
      theatricals in the full sense of the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody of course was concerned to satisfy this wish of Gwendolen&rsquo;s,
      and Rex proposed that they should wind up with a tableau in which the
      effect of her majesty would not be marred by any one&rsquo;s speech. This
      pleased her thoroughly, and the only question was the choice of the
      tableau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something pleasant, children, I beseech you,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have any Greek wickedness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no worse than Christian wickedness, mamma,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, whose mention of Rachelesque heroines had called forth that
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And less scandalous,&rdquo; said Rex. &ldquo;Besides, one thinks of
      it as all gone by and done with. What do you say to Briseis being led
      away? I would be Achilles, and you would be looking round at me&mdash;after
      the print we have at the rectory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a good attitude for me,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, in a
      tone of acceptance. But afterward she said with decision, &ldquo;No. It
      will not do. There must be three men in proper costume, else it will be
      ridiculous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; said Rex, after a little reflection. &ldquo;Hermione
      as the statue in Winter&rsquo;s Tale? I will be Leontes, and Miss Merry,
      Paulina, one on each side. Our dress won&rsquo;t signify,&rdquo; he went
      on laughingly; &ldquo;it will be more Shakespearian and romantic if
      Leontes looks like Napoleon, and Paulina like a modern spinster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Hermione was chosen; all agreeing that age was of no consequence, but
      Gwendolen urged that instead of the mere tableau there should be just
      enough acting of the scene to introduce the striking up of the music as a
      signal for her to step down and advance; when Leontes, instead of
      embracing her, was to kneel and kiss the hem of her garment, and so the
      curtain was to fall. The antechamber with folding doors lent itself
      admirably to the purpose of a stage, and the whole of the establishment,
      with the addition of Jarrett the village carpenter, was absorbed in the
      preparations for an entertainment, which, considering that it was an
      imitation of acting, was likely to be successful, since we know from
      ancient fable that an imitation may have more chance of success than the
      original.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen was not without a special exultation in the prospect of this
      occasion, for she knew that Herr Klesmer was again at Quetcham, and she
      had taken care to include him among the invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer came. He was in one of his placid, silent moods, and sat in serene
      contemplation, replying to all appeals in benignant-sounding syllables
      more or less articulate&mdash;as taking up his cross meekly in a world
      overgrown with amateurs, or as careful how he moved his lion paws lest he
      should crush a rampant and vociferous mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything indeed went off smoothly and according to expectation&mdash;all
      that was improvised and accidental being of a probable sort&mdash;until
      the incident occurred which showed Gwendolen in an unforeseen phase of
      emotion. How it came about was at first a mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tableau of Hermione was doubly striking from its dissimilarity with
      what had gone before: it was answering perfectly, and a murmur of applause
      had been gradually suppressed while Leontes gave his permission that
      Paulina should exercise her utmost art and make the statue move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hermione, her arm resting on a pillar, was elevated by about six inches,
      which she counted on as a means of showing her pretty foot and instep,
      when at the given signal she should advance and descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Music, awake her, strike!&rdquo; said Paulina (Mrs. Davilow, who,
      by special entreaty, had consented to take the part in a white burnous and
      hood).
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Klesmer, who had been good-natured enough to seat himself at the
      piano, struck a thunderous chord&mdash;but in the same instant, and before
      Hermione had put forth her foot, the movable panel, which was on a line
      with the piano, flew open on the right opposite the stage and disclosed
      the picture of the dead face and the fleeing figure, brought out in pale
      definiteness by the position of the wax-lights. Everyone was startled, but
      all eyes in the act of turning toward the open panel were recalled by a
      piercing cry from Gwendolen, who stood without change of attitude, but
      with a change of expression that was terrifying in its terror. She looked
      like a statue into which a soul of Fear had entered: her pallid lips were
      parted; her eyes, usually narrowed under their long lashes, were dilated
      and fixed. Her mother, less surprised than alarmed, rushed toward her, and
      Rex, too, could not help going to her side. But the touch of her mother&rsquo;s
      arm had the effect of an electric charge; Gwendolen fell on her knees and
      put her hands before her face. She was still trembling, but mute, and it
      seemed that she had self-consciousness enough to aim at controlling her
      signs of terror, for she presently allowed herself to be raised from her
      kneeling posture and led away, while the company were relieving their
      minds by explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A magnificent bit of <i>plastik</i> that!&rdquo; said Klesmer to
      Miss Arrowpoint. And a quick fire of undertoned question and answer went
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it part of the play?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, surely not. Miss Harleth was too much affected. A sensitive
      creature!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! I was not aware that there was a painting behind that
      panel; were you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; how should I? Some eccentricity in one of the Earl&rsquo;s
      family long ago, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very painful! Pray shut it up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the door locked? It is very mysterious. It must be the spirits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is no medium present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that? We must conclude that there is, when such
      things happen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the door was not locked; it was probably the sudden vibration
      from the piano that sent it open.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This conclusion came from Mr. Gascoigne, who begged Miss Merry if possible
      to get the key. But this readiness to explain the mystery was thought by
      Mrs. Vulcany unbecoming in a clergyman, and she observed in an undertone
      that Mr. Gascoigne was always a little too worldly for her taste. However,
      the key was produced, and the rector turned it in the lock with an
      emphasis rather offensively rationalizing&mdash;as who should say, &ldquo;it
      will not start open again&rdquo;&mdash;putting the key in his pocket as a
      security.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Gwendolen soon reappeared, showing her usual spirits, and
      evidently determined to ignore as far as she could the striking change she
      had made in the part of Hermione.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Klesmer said to her, &ldquo;We have to thank you for devising a
      perfect climax: you could not have chosen a finer bit of <i>plastik</i>,&rdquo;
      there was a flush of pleasure in her face. She liked to accept as a belief
      what was really no more than delicate feigning. He divined that the
      betrayal into a passion of fear had been mortifying to her, and wished her
      to understand that he took it for good acting. Gwendolen cherished the
      idea that now he was struck with her talent as well as her beauty, and her
      uneasiness about his opinion was half turned to complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      But too many were in the secret of what had been included in the
      rehearsals, and what had not, and no one besides Klesmer took the trouble
      to soothe Gwendolen&rsquo;s imagined mortification. The general sentiment
      was that the incident should be let drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had really been a medium concerned in the starting open of the
      panel: one who had quitted the room in haste and crept to bed in much
      alarm of conscience. It was the small Isabel, whose intense curiosity,
      unsatisfied by the brief glimpse she had had of the strange picture on the
      day of arrival at Offendene, had kept her on the watch for an opportunity
      of finding out where Gwendolen had put the key, of stealing it from the
      discovered drawer when the rest of the family were out, and getting on a
      stool to unlock the panel. While she was indulging her thirst for
      knowledge in this way, a noise which she feared was an approaching
      footstep alarmed her: she closed the door and attempted hurriedly to lock
      it, but failing and not daring to linger, she withdrew the key and trusted
      that the panel would stick, as it seemed well inclined to do. In this
      confidence she had returned the key to its former place, stilling any
      anxiety by the thought that if the door were discovered to be unlocked
      nobody would know how the unlocking came about. The inconvenient Isabel,
      like other offenders, did not foresee her own impulse to confession, a
      fatality which came upon her the morning after the party, when Gwendolen
      said at the breakfast-table, &ldquo;I know the door was locked before the
      housekeeper gave me the key, for I tried it myself afterward. Some one
      must have been to my drawer and taken the key.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Isabel that Gwendolen&rsquo;s awful eyes had rested on her
      more than on the other sisters, and without any time for resolve, she
      said, with a trembling lip:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please forgive me, Gwendolen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The forgiveness was sooner bestowed than it would have been if Gwendolen
      had not desired to dismiss from her own and every one else&rsquo;s memory
      any case in which she had shown her susceptibility to terror. She wondered
      at herself in these occasional experiences, which seemed like a brief
      remembered madness, an unexplained exception from her normal life; and in
      this instance she felt a peculiar vexation that her helpless fear had
      shown itself, not, as usual, in solitude, but in well-lit company. Her
      ideal was to be daring in speech and reckless in braving dangers, both
      moral and physical; and though her practice fell far behind her ideal,
      this shortcoming seemed to be due to the pettiness of circumstances, the
      narrow theatre which life offers to a girl of twenty, who cannot conceive
      herself as anything else than a lady, or as in any position which would
      lack the tribute of respect. She had no permanent consciousness of other
      fetters, or of more spiritual restraints, having always disliked whatever
      was presented to her under the name of religion, in the same way that some
      people dislike arithmetic and accounts: it had raised no other emotion in
      her, no alarm, no longing; so that the question whether she believed it
      had not occurred to her any more than it had occurred to her to inquire
      into the conditions of colonial property and banking, on which, as she had
      had many opportunities of knowing, the family fortune was dependent. All
      these facts about herself she would have been ready to admit, and even,
      more or less indirectly, to state. What she unwillingly recognized, and
      would have been glad for others to be unaware of, was that liability of
      hers to fits of spiritual dread, though this fountain of awe within her
      had not found its way into connection with the religion taught her or with
      any human relations. She was ashamed and frightened, as at what might
      happen again, in remembering her tremor on suddenly feeling herself alone,
      when, for example, she was walking without companionship and there came
      some rapid change in the light. Solitude in any wide scene impressed her
      with an undefined feeling of immeasurable existence aloof from her, in the
      midst of which she was helplessly incapable of asserting herself. The
      little astronomy taught her at school used sometimes to set her
      imagination at work in a way that made her tremble: but always when some
      one joined her she recovered her indifference to the vastness in which she
      seemed an exile; she found again her usual world in which her will was of
      some avail, and the religious nomenclature belonging to this world was no
      more identified for her with those uneasy impressions of awe than her
      uncle&rsquo;s surplices seen out of use at the rectory. With human ears
      and eyes about her, she had always hitherto recovered her confidence, and
      felt the possibility of winning empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her mamma and others her fits of timidity or terror were sufficiently
      accounted for by her &ldquo;sensitiveness&rdquo; or the &ldquo;excitability
      of her nature&rdquo;; but these explanatory phrases required conciliation
      with much that seemed to be blank indifference or rare self-mastery. Heat
      is a great agent and a useful word, but considered as a means of
      explaining the universe it requires an extensive knowledge of differences;
      and as a means of explaining character &ldquo;sensitiveness&rdquo; is in
      much the same predicament. But who, loving a creature like Gwendolen,
      would not be inclined to regard every peculiarity in her as a mark of
      preeminence? That was what Rex did. After the Hermione scene he was more
      persuaded than ever that she must be instinct with all feeling, and not
      only readier to respond to a worshipful love, but able to love better than
      other girls. Rex felt the summer on his young wings and soared happily.

</pre>
    <p>
      The first sign of the unimagined snow-storm was like the transparent white
      cloud that seems to set off the blue. Anna was in the secret of Rex&rsquo;s
      feeling; though for the first time in their lives he had said nothing to
      her about what he most thought of, and he only took it for granted that
      she knew it. For the first time, too, Anna could not say to Rex what was
      continually in her mind. Perhaps it might have been a pain which she would
      have had to conceal, that he should so soon care for some one else more
      than for herself, if such a feeling had not been thoroughly neutralized by
      doubt and anxiety on his behalf. Anna admired her cousin&mdash;would have
      said with simple sincerity, &ldquo;Gwendolen is always very good to me,&rdquo;
      and held it in the order of things for herself to be entirely subject to
      this cousin; but she looked at her with mingled fear and distrust, with a
      puzzled contemplation as of some wondrous and beautiful animal whose
      nature was a mystery, and who, for anything Anna knew, might have an
      appetite for devouring all the small creatures that were her own
      particular pets. And now Anna&rsquo;s heart was sinking under the heavy
      conviction which she dared not utter, that Gwendolen would never care for
      Rex. What she herself held in tenderness and reverence had constantly
      seemed indifferent to Gwendolen, and it was easier to imagine her scorning
      Rex than returning any tenderness of his. Besides, she was always thinking
      of being something extraordinary. And poor Rex! Papa would be angry with
      him if he knew. And of course he was too young to be in love in that way;
      and she, Anna had thought that it would be years and years before any
      thing of that sort came, and that she would be Rex&rsquo;s housekeeper
      ever so long. But what a heart must that be which did not return his love!
      Anna, in the prospect of his suffering, was beginning to dislike her too
      fascinating cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to her, as it did to Rex, that the weeks had been filled with a
      tumultuous life evident to all observers: if he had been questioned on the
      subject he would have said that he had no wish to conceal what he hoped
      would be an engagement which he should immediately tell his father of: and
      yet for the first time in his life he was reserved not only about his
      feelings but&mdash;which was more remarkable to Anna&mdash;about certain
      actions. She, on her side, was nervous each time her father or mother
      began to speak to her in private lest they should say anything about Rex
      and Gwendolen. But the elders were not in the least alive to this
      agitating drama, which went forward chiefly in a sort of pantomime
      extremely lucid in the minds thus expressing themselves, but easily missed
      by spectators who were running their eyes over the <i>Guardian</i> or the
      <i>Clerical Gazette</i>, and regarded the trivialities of the young ones
      with scarcely more interpretation than they gave to the action of lively
      ants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going, Rex?&rdquo; said Anna one gray morning when
      her father had set off in his carriage to the sessions, Mrs. Gascoigne
      with him, and she had observed that her brother had on his antigropelos,
      the utmost approach he possessed to a hunting equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to see the hounds throw off at the Three Barns.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to take Gwendolen?&rdquo; said Anna, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told you, did she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I thought&mdash;Does papa know you are going?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I am aware of. I don&rsquo;t suppose he would trouble
      himself about the matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to use his horse?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows I do that whenever I can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Gwendolen ride after the hounds, Rex,&rdquo; said
      Anna, whose fears gifted her with second-sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Rex, smiling rather provokingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa and mamma and aunt Davilow all wish her not to. They think it
      is not right for her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you suppose she is going to do what is not right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gwendolen minds nobody sometimes,&rdquo; said Anna getting bolder
      by dint of a little anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she would not mind me,&rdquo; said Rex, perversely making a
      joke of poor Anna&rsquo;s anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Rex, I cannot bear it. You will make yourself very unhappy.&rdquo;
      Here Anna burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nannie, Nannie, what on earth is the matter with you?&rdquo; said
      Rex, a little impatient at being kept in this way, hat on and whip in
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will not care for you one bit&mdash;I know she never will!&rdquo;
      said the poor child in a sobbing whisper. She had lost all control of
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rex reddened and hurried away from her out of the hall door, leaving her
      to the miserable consciousness of having made herself disagreeable in
      vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did think of her words as he rode along; they had the unwelcomeness
      which all unfavorable fortune-telling has, even when laughed at; but he
      quickly explained them as springing from little Anna&rsquo;s tenderness,
      and began to be sorry that he was obliged to come away without soothing
      her. Every other feeling on the subject, however, was quickly merged in a
      resistant belief to the contrary of hers, accompanied with a new
      determination to prove that he was right. This sort of certainty had just
      enough kinship to doubt and uneasiness to hurry on a confession which an
      untouched security might have delayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen was already mounted and riding up and down the avenue when Rex
      appeared at the gate. She had provided herself against disappointment in
      case he did not appear in time by having the groom ready behind her, for
      she would not have waited beyond a reasonable time. But now the groom was
      dismissed, and the two rode away in delightful freedom. Gwendolen was in
      her highest spirits, and Rex thought that she had never looked so lovely
      before; her figure, her long white throat, and the curves of her cheek and
      chin were always set off to perfection by the compact simplicity of her
      riding dress. He could not conceive a more perfect girl; and to a youthful
      lover like Rex it seems that the fundamental identity of the good, the
      true and the beautiful, is already extant and manifest in the object of
      his love. Most observers would have held it more than equally accountable
      that a girl should have like impressions about Rex, for in his handsome
      face there was nothing corresponding to the undefinable stinging quality&mdash;as
      it were a trace of demon ancestry&mdash;which made some beholders hesitate
      in their admiration of Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an exquisite January morning in which there was no threat of rain,
      but a gray sky making the calmest background for the charms of a mild
      winter scene&mdash;the grassy borders of the lanes, the hedgerows
      sprinkled with red berries and haunted with low twitterings, the purple
      bareness of the elms, the rich brown of the furrows. The horses&rsquo;
      hoofs made a musical chime, accompanying their young voices. She was
      laughing at his equipment, for he was the reverse of a dandy, and he was
      enjoying her laughter; the freshness of the morning mingled with the
      freshness of their youth; and every sound that came from their clear
      throats, every glance they gave each other, was the bubbling outflow from
      a spring of joy. It was all morning to them, within and without. And
      thinking of them in these moments one is tempted to that futile sort of
      wishing&mdash;if only things could have been a little otherwise then, so
      as to have been greatly otherwise after&mdash;if only these two beautiful
      young creatures could have pledged themselves to each other then and
      there, and never through life have swerved from that pledge! For some of
      the goodness which Rex believed in was there. Goodness is a large, often a
      prospective word; like harvest, which at one stage when we talk of it lies
      all underground, with an indeterminate future; is the germ prospering in
      the darkness? at another, it has put forth delicate green blades, and
      by-and-by the trembling blossoms are ready to be dashed off by an hour of
      rough wind or rain. Each stage has its peculiar blight, and may have the
      healthy life choked out of it by a particular action of the foul land
      which rears or neighbors it, or by damage brought from foulness afar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anna had got it into her head that you would want to ride after the
      hounds this morning,&rdquo; said Rex, whose secret associations with Anna&rsquo;s
      words made this speech seem quite perilously near the most momentous of
      subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, laughingly. &ldquo;What a little
      clairvoyant she is!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you?&rdquo; said Rex, who had not believed in her intending
      to do it if the elders objected, but confided in her having good reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t tell what I shall do till I get
      there. Clairvoyants are often wrong: they foresee what is likely. I am not
      fond of what is likely: it is always dull. I do what is unlikely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there you tell me a secret. When once I knew what people in
      general would be likely to do, I should know you would do the opposite. So
      you would have come round to a likelihood of your own sort. I shall be
      able to calculate on you. You couldn&rsquo;t surprise me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I could. I should turn round and do what was likely for people
      in general,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a musical laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see you can&rsquo;t escape some sort of likelihood. And
      contradictoriness makes the strongest likelihood of all. You must give up
      a plan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shall not. My plan is to do what pleases me.&rdquo; (Here
      should any young lady incline to imitate Gwendolen, let her consider the
      set of her head and neck: if the angle there had been different, the chin
      protrusive, and the cervical vertebrae a trifle more curved in their
      position, ten to one Gwendolen&rsquo;s words would have had a jar in them
      for the sweet-natured Rex. But everything odd in her speech was humor and
      pretty banter, which he was only anxious to turn toward one point.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you manage to feel only what pleases you?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not; that comes from what other people do. But if the
      world were pleasanter, one would only feel what was pleasant. Girls&rsquo;
      lives are so stupid: they never do what they like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that was more the case of the men. They are forced to do
      hard things, and are often dreadfully bored, and knocked to pieces too.
      And then, if we love a girl very dearly we want to do as she likes, so
      after all you have your own way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it. I never saw a married woman who had her
      own way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should you like to do?&rdquo; said Rex, quite guilelessly, and
      in real anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know!&mdash;go to the North Pole, or ride
      steeple-chases, or go to be a queen in the East like Lady Hester Stanhope,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, flightily. Her words were born on her lips, but she would
      have been at a loss to give an answer of deeper origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you would never be married?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I didn&rsquo;t say that. Only when I married, I should not do
      as other women do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might do just as you liked if you married a man who loved you
      more dearly than anything else in the world,&rdquo; said Rex, who, poor
      youth, was moving in themes outside the curriculum in which he had
      promised to win distinction. &ldquo;I know one who does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of Mr. Middleton, for heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, hastily, a quick blush spreading over her face and neck;
      &ldquo;that is Anna&rsquo;s chant. I hear the hounds. Let us go on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her chestnut to a canter, and Rex had no choice but to follow her.
      Still he felt encouraged. Gwendolen was perfectly aware that her cousin
      was in love with her; but she had no idea that the matter was of any
      consequence, having never had the slightest visitation of painful love
      herself. She wished the small romance of Rex&rsquo;s devotion to fill up
      the time of his stay at Pennicote, and to avoid explanations which would
      bring it to an untimely end. Besides, she objected, with a sort of
      physical repulsion, to being directly made love to. With all her
      imaginative delight in being adored, there was a certain fierceness of
      maidenhood in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all other thoughts were soon lost for her in the excitement of the
      scene at the Three Barns. Several gentlemen of the hunt knew her, and she
      exchanged pleasant greetings. Rex could not get another word with her. The
      color, the stir of the field had taken possession of Gwendolen with a
      strength which was not due to habitual associations, for she had never yet
      ridden after the hounds&mdash;only said she should like to do it, and so
      drawn forth a prohibition; her mamma dreading the danger, and her uncle
      declaring that for his part he held that kind of violent exercise unseemly
      in a woman, and that whatever might be done in other parts of the country,
      no lady of good position followed the Wessex hunt: no one but Mrs. Gadsby,
      the yeomanry captain&rsquo;s wife, who had been a kitchenmaid and still
      spoke like one. This last argument had some effect on Gwendolen, and had
      kept her halting between her desire to assert her freedom and her horror
      of being classed with Mrs. Gadsby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the most unexceptionable women in the neighborhood occasionally
      went to see the hounds throw off; but it happened that none of them were
      present this morning to abstain from following, while Mrs. Gadsby, with
      her doubtful antecedents, grammatical and otherwise, was not visible to
      make following seem unbecoming. Thus Gwendolen felt no check on the animal
      stimulus that came from the stir and tongue of the hounds, the pawing of
      the horses, the varying voices of men, the movement hither and thither of
      vivid color on the background of green and gray stillness:&mdash;that
      utmost excitement of the coming chase which consists in feeling something
      like a combination of dog and horse, with the superadded thrill of social
      vanities and consciousness of centaur-power which belongs to humankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rex would have felt more of the same enjoyment if he could have kept
      nearer to Gwendolen, and not seen her constantly occupied with
      acquaintances, or looked at by would-be acquaintances, all on lively
      horses which veered about and swept the surrounding space as effectually
      as a revolving lever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you here this fine morning, Miss Harleth,&rdquo; said
      Lord Brackenshaw, a middle-aged peer of aristocratic seediness in stained
      pink, with easy-going manners which would have made the threatened deluge
      seem of no consequence. &ldquo;We shall have a first-rate run. A pity you
      didn&rsquo;t go with us. Have you ever tried your little chestnut at a
      ditch? you wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least in the world,&rdquo; said Gwendolen. And that was
      true: she was never fearful in action and companionship. &ldquo;I have
      often taken him at some rails and a ditch too, near&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, by Jove!&rdquo; said his lordship, quietly, in notation that
      something was happening which must break off the dialogue: and as he
      reined off his horse, Rex was bringing his sober hackney up to Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      side when&mdash;the hounds gave tongue, and the whole field was in motion
      as if the whirl of the earth were carrying it; Gwendolen along with
      everything else; no word of notice to Rex, who without a second thought
      followed too. Could he let Gwendolen go alone? under other circumstances
      he would have enjoyed the run, but he was just now perturbed by the check
      which had been put on the impetus to utter his love, and get utterance in
      return, an impetus which could not at once resolve itself into a totally
      different sort of chase, at least with the consciousness of being on his
      father&rsquo;s gray nag, a good horse enough in his way, but of sober
      years and ecclesiastical habits. Gwendolen on her spirited little chestnut
      was up with the best, and felt as secure as an immortal goddess, having,
      if she had thought of risk, a core of confidence that no ill luck would
      happen to her. But she thought of no such thing, and certainly not of any
      risk there might be for her cousin. If she had thought of him, it would
      have struck her as a droll picture that he should be gradually falling
      behind, and looking round in search of gates: a fine lithe youth, whose
      heart must be panting with all the spirit of a beagle, stuck as if under a
      wizard&rsquo;s spell on a stiff clerical hackney, would have made her
      laugh with a sense of fun much too strong for her to reflect on his
      mortification. But Gwendolen was apt to think rather of those who saw her
      than of those whom she could not see; and Rex was soon so far behind that
      if she had looked she would not have seen him. For I grieve to say that in
      the search for a gate, along a lane lately mended, Primrose fell, broke
      his knees, and undesignedly threw Rex over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately a blacksmith&rsquo;s son who also followed the hounds under
      disadvantages, namely, on foot (a loose way of hunting which had struck
      some even frivolous minds as immoral), was naturally also in the rear, and
      happened to be within sight of Rex&rsquo;s misfortune. He ran to give help
      which was greatly needed, for Rex was a great deal stunned, and the
      complete recovery of sensation came in the form of pain. Joel Dagge on
      this occasion showed himself that most useful of personages, whose
      knowledge is of a kind suited to the immediate occasion: he not only knew
      perfectly well what was the matter with the horse, how far they were both
      from the nearest public-house and from Pennicote Rectory, and could
      certify to Rex that his shoulder was only a bit out of joint, but also
      offered experienced surgical aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, sir, let me shove it in again for you! I&rsquo;s seen Nash,
      the bone-setter, do it, and done it myself for our little Sally twice
      over. It&rsquo;s all one and the same, shoulders is. If you&rsquo;ll
      trusten to me and tighten your mind up a bit, I&rsquo;ll do it for you in
      no time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come then, old fellow,&rdquo; said Rex, who could tighten his mind
      better than his seat in the saddle. And Joel managed the operation, though
      not without considerable expense of pain to his patient, who turned so
      pitiably pale while tightening his mind, that Joel remarked, &ldquo;Ah,
      sir, you aren&rsquo;t used to it, that&rsquo;s how it is. I&rsquo;s see
      lots and lots o&rsquo; joints out. I see a man with his eye pushed out
      once&mdash;that was a rum go as ever I see. You can&rsquo;t have a bit o&rsquo;
      fun wi&rsquo;out such sort o&rsquo; things. But it went in again. I&rsquo;s
      swallowed three teeth mysen, as sure as I&rsquo;m alive. Now, sirrey&rdquo;
      (this was addressed to Primrose), &ldquo;come alonk&mdash;you musn&rsquo;t
      make believe as you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Joel being clearly a low character, it is, happily, not necessary to say
      more of him to the refined reader, than that he helped Rex to get home
      with as little delay as possible. There was no alternative but to get
      home, though all the while he was in anxiety about Gwendolen, and more
      miserable in the thought that she, too, might have had an accident, than
      in the pain of his own bruises and the annoyance he was about to cause his
      father. He comforted himself about her by reflecting that every one would
      be anxious to take care of her, and that some acquaintance would be sure
      to conduct her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gascoigne was already at home, and was writing letters in his study,
      when he was interrupted by seeing poor Rex come in with a face which was
      not the less handsome and ingratiating for being pale and a little
      distressed. He was secretly the favorite son, and a young portrait of the
      father; who, however, never treated him with any partiality&mdash;rather,
      with an extra rigor. Mr. Gascoigne having inquired of Anna, knew that Rex
      had gone with Gwendolen to the meet at the Three Barns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he said hastily, not laying down his
      pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, sir; Primrose has fallen down and broken his
      knees.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been with him?&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne, with a
      touch of severity. He rarely gave way to temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Three Barns to see the hounds throw off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were fool enough to follow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I didn&rsquo;t go at any fences, but the horse got his
      leg into a hole.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you got hurt yourself, I hope, eh!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got my shoulder put out, but a young blacksmith put it in again
      for me. I&rsquo;m just a little battered, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sit down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry about the horse, sir; I knew it would be a
      vexation to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what has become of Gwendolen?&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne,
      abruptly. Rex, who did not imagine that his father had made any inquiries
      about him, answered at first with a blush, which was the more remarkable
      for his previous paleness. Then he said, nervously,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am anxious to know&mdash;I should like to go or send at once to
      Offendene&mdash;but she rides so well, and I think she would keep up&mdash;there
      would most likely be many round her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it was she who led you on, eh?&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne,
      laying down his pen, leaning back in his chair, and looking at Rex with
      more marked examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was natural for her to want to go: she didn&rsquo;t intend it
      beforehand&mdash;she was led away by the spirit of the thing. And, of
      course, I went when she went.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gascoigne left a brief interval of silence, and then said, with quiet
      irony,&mdash;&ldquo;But now you observe, young gentleman, that you are not
      furnished with a horse which will enable you to play the squire to your
      cousin. You must give up that amusement. You have spoiled my nag for me,
      and that is enough mischief for one vacation. I shall beg you to get ready
      to start for Southampton to-morrow and join Stilfox, till you go up to
      Oxford with him. That will be good for your bruises as well as your
      studies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Rex felt his heart swelling and comporting itself as if it had been
      no better than a girl&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will not insist on my going immediately, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel too ill?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; here Rex bit his lips and felt
      the tears starting, to his great vexation; then he rallied and tried to
      say more firmly, &ldquo;I want to go to Offendene, but I can go this
      evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going there myself. I can bring word about Gwendolen, if that
      is what you want.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rex broke down. He thought he discerned an intention fatal to his
      happiness, nay, his life. He was accustomed to believe in his father&rsquo;s
      penetration, and to expect firmness. &ldquo;Father, I can&rsquo;t go away
      without telling her that I love her, and knowing that she loves me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gascoigne was inwardly going through some self-rebuke for not being
      more wary, and was now really sorry for the lad; but every consideration
      was subordinate to that of using the wisest tactics in the case. He had
      quickly made up his mind and to answer the more quietly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, you are too young to be taking momentous, decisive
      steps of that sort. This is a fancy which you have got into your head
      during an idle week or two: you must set to work at something and dismiss
      it. There is every reason against it. An engagement at your age would be
      totally rash and unjustifiable; and moreover, alliances between first
      cousins are undesirable. Make up your mind to a brief disappointment. Life
      is full of them. We have all got to be broken in; and this is a mild
      beginning for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not mild. I can&rsquo;t bear it. I shall be good for nothing. I
      shouldn&rsquo;t mind anything, if it were settled between us. I could do
      anything then,&rdquo; said Rex, impetuously. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s of no
      use to pretend that I will obey you. I can&rsquo;t do it. If I said I
      would, I should be sure to break my word. I should see Gwendolen again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, wait till to-morrow morning, that we may talk of the matter
      again&mdash;you will promise me that,&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne, quietly;
      and Rex did not, could not refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector did not even tell his wife that he had any other reason for
      going to Offendene that evening than his desire to ascertain that
      Gwendolen had got home safely. He found her more than safe&mdash;elated.
      Mr. Quallon, who had won the brush, had delivered the trophy to her, and
      she had brought it before her, fastened on the saddle; more than that,
      Lord Brackenshaw had conducted her home, and had shown himself delighted
      with her spirited riding. All this was told at once to her uncle, that he
      might see how well justified she had been in acting against his advice;
      and the prudential rector did feel himself in a slight difficulty, for at
      that moment he was particularly sensible that it was his niece&rsquo;s
      serious interest to be well regarded by the Brackenshaws, and their
      opinion as to her following the hounds really touched the essence of his
      objection. However, he was not obliged to say anything immediately, for
      Mrs. Davilow followed up Gwendolen&rsquo;s brief triumphant phrases with,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, I do hope you will not do it again, Gwendolen. I should
      never have a moment&rsquo;s quiet. Her father died by an accident, you
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mrs. Davilow had turned away from Gwendolen, and looked at Mr.
      Gascoigne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, dear,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, kissing her merrily, and
      passing over the question of the fears which Mrs. Davilow had meant to
      account for, &ldquo;children don&rsquo;t take after their parents in
      broken legs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one word had yet been said about Rex. In fact there had been no
      anxiety about him at Offendene. Gwendolen had observed to her mamma,
      &ldquo;Oh, he must have been left far behind, and gone home in despair,&rdquo;
      and it could not be denied that this was fortunate so far as it made way
      for Lord Brackenshaw&rsquo;s bringing her home. But now Mr. Gascoigne
      said, with some emphasis, looking at Gwendolen,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the exploit has ended better for you than for Rex.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I dare say he had to make a terrible round. You have not
      taught Primrose to take the fences, uncle,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, without
      the faintest shade of alarm in her looks and tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rex has had a fall,&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne, curtly, throwing
      himself into an arm-chair resting his elbows and fitting his palms and
      fingers together, while he closed his lips and looked at Gwendolen, who
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, poor fellow! he is not hurt, I hope?&rdquo; with a correct look
      of anxiety such as elated mortals try to super-induce when their pulses
      are all the while quick with triumph; and Mrs. Davilow, in the same
      moment, uttered a low &ldquo;Good heavens! There!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gascoigne went on: &ldquo;He put his shoulder out, and got some
      bruises, I believe.&rdquo; Here he made another little pause of
      observation; but Gwendolen, instead of any such symptoms as pallor and
      silence, had only deepened the compassionateness of her brow and eyes, and
      said again, &ldquo;Oh, poor fellow! it is nothing serious, then?&rdquo;
      and Mr. Gascoigne held his diagnosis complete. But he wished to make
      assurance doubly sure, and went on still with a purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got his arm set again rather oddly. Some blacksmith&mdash;not a
      parishioner of mine&mdash;was on the field&mdash;a loose fish, I suppose,
      but handy, and set the arm for him immediately. So after all, I believe, I
      and Primrose come off worst. The horse&rsquo;s knees are cut to pieces. He
      came down in a hole, it seems, and pitched Rex over his head.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s face had allowably become contented again, since Rex&rsquo;s
      arm had been reset; and now, at the descriptive suggestions in the latter
      part of her uncle&rsquo;s speech, her elated spirits made her features
      less unmanageable than usual; the smiles broke forth, and finally a
      descending scale of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a pretty young lady&mdash;to laugh at other people&rsquo;s
      calamities,&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne, with a milder sense of
      disapprobation than if he had not had counteracting reasons to be glad
      that Gwendolen showed no deep feeling on the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray forgive me, uncle. Now Rex is safe, it is so droll to fancy
      the figure he and Primrose would cut&mdash;in a lane all by themselves&mdash;only
      a blacksmith running up. It would make a capital caricature of &lsquo;Following
      the Hounds.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen rather valued herself on her superior freedom in laughing where
      others might only see matter for seriousness. Indeed, the laughter became
      her person so well that her opinion of its gracefulness was often shared
      by others; and it even entered into her uncle&rsquo;s course of thought at
      this moment, that it was no wonder a boy should be fascinated by this
      young witch&mdash;who, however, was more mischievous than could be
      desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you laugh at broken bones, child?&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow,
      still under her dominant anxiety. &ldquo;I wish we had never allowed you
      to have the horse. You will see that we were wrong,&rdquo; she added,
      looking with a grave nod at Mr. Gascoigne&mdash;&ldquo;at least I was, to
      encourage her in asking for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, seriously, Gwendolen,&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne, in a
      judicious tone of rational advice to a person understood to be altogether
      rational, &ldquo;I strongly recommend you&mdash;I shall ask you to oblige
      me so far&mdash;not to repeat your adventure of to-day. Lord Brackenshaw
      is very kind, but I feel sure that he would concur with me in what I say.
      To be spoken of as &lsquo;the young lady who hunts&rsquo; by way of
      exception, would give a tone to the language about you which I am sure you
      would not like. Depend upon it, his lordship would not choose that Lady
      Beatrice or Lady Maria should hunt in this part of the country, if they
      were old enough to do so. When you are married, it will be different: you
      may do whatever your husband sanctions. But if you intend to hunt, you
      must marry a man who can keep horses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I should do anything so horrible as to marry
      without <i>that</i> prospect, at least,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, pettishly.
      Her uncle&rsquo;s speech had given her annoyance, which she could not show
      more directly; but she felt that she was committing herself, and after
      moving carelessly to another part of the room, went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She always speaks in that way about marriage,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow; &ldquo;but it will be different when she has seen the right
      person.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her heart has never been in the least touched, that you know of?&rdquo;
      said Mr. Gascoigne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow shook her head silently. &ldquo;It was only last night she
      said to me, &lsquo;Mamma, I wonder how girls manage to fall in love. It is
      easy to make them do it in books. But men are too ridiculous.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gascoigne laughed a little, and made no further remark on the subject.
      The next morning at breakfast he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are your bruises, Rex?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not very mellow yet, sir; only beginning to turn a little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel quite ready for a journey to Southampton?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; answered Rex, with his heart metaphorically in
      his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can wait till to-morrow, and go to say goodbye to them at
      Offendene.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gascoigne, who now knew the whole affair, looked steadily at her
      coffee lest she also should begin to cry, as Anna was doing already.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gascoigne felt that he was applying a sharp remedy to poor Rex&rsquo;s
      acute attack, but he believed it to be in the end the kindest. To let him
      know the hopelessness of his love from Gwendolen&rsquo;s own lips might be
      curative in more ways than one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can only be thankful that she doesn&rsquo;t care about him,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Gascoigne, when she joined her husband in his study. &ldquo;There
      are things in Gwendolen I cannot reconcile myself to. My Anna is worth two
      of her, with all her beauty and talent. It looks very ill in her that she
      will not help in the schools with Anna&mdash;not even in the
      Sunday-school. What you or I advise is of no consequence to her: and poor
      Fannie is completely under her thumb. But I know you think better of her,&rdquo;
      Mrs. Gascoigne ended with a deferential hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, there is no harm in the girl. It is only that she has
      a high spirit, and it will not do to hold the reins too tight. The point
      is, to get her well married. She has a little too much fire in her for her
      present life with her mother and sisters. It is natural and right that she
      should be married soon&mdash;not to a poor man, but one who can give her a
      fitting position.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Rex, with his arm in a sling, was on his two miles&rsquo; walk
      to Offendene. He was rather puzzled by the unconditional permission to see
      Gwendolen, but his father&rsquo;s real ground of action could not enter
      into his conjectures. If it had, he would first have thought it horribly
      cold-blooded, and then have disbelieved in his father&rsquo;s conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got to the house, everybody was there but Gwendolen. The four
      girls, hearing him speak in the hall, rushed out of the library, which was
      their school-room, and hung round him with compassionate inquiries about
      his arm. Mrs. Davilow wanted to know exactly what had happened, and where
      the blacksmith lived, that she might make him a present; while Miss Merry,
      who took a subdued and melancholy part in all family affairs, doubted
      whether it would not be giving too much encouragement to that kind of
      character. Rex had never found the family troublesome before, but just now
      he wished them all away and Gwendolen there, and he was too uneasy for
      good-natured feigning. When at last he had said, &ldquo;Where is
      Gwendolen?&rdquo; and Mrs. Davilow had told Alice to go and see if her
      sister were come down, adding, &ldquo;I sent up her breakfast this
      morning. She needed a long rest.&rdquo; Rex took the shortest way out of
      his endurance by saying, almost impatiently, &ldquo;Aunt, I want to speak
      to Gwendolen&mdash;I want to see her alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, dear; go into the drawing-room. I will send her there,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Davilow, who had observed that he was fond of being with
      Gwendolen, as was natural, but had not thought of this as having any
      bearing on the realities of life: it seemed merely part of the Christmas
      holidays which were spinning themselves out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rex for his part thought that the realities of life were all hanging on
      this interview. He had to walk up and down the drawing-room in expectation
      for nearly ten minutes&mdash;ample space for all imaginative fluctuations;
      yet, strange to say, he was unvaryingly occupied in thinking what and how
      much he could do, when Gwendolen had accepted him, to satisfy his father
      that the engagement was the most prudent thing in the world, since it
      inspired him with double energy for work. He was to be a lawyer, and what
      reason was there why he should not rise as high as Eldon did? He was
      forced to look at life in the light of his father&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the door opened and she whose presence he was longing for
      entered, there came over him suddenly and mysteriously a state of tremor
      and distrust which he had never felt before. Miss Gwendolen, simple as she
      stood there, in her black silk, cut square about the round white pillar of
      her throat, a black band fastening her hair which streamed backward in
      smooth silky abundance, seemed more queenly than usual. Perhaps it was
      that there was none of the latent fun and tricksiness which had always
      pierced in her greeting of Rex. How much of this was due to her
      presentiment from what he had said yesterday that he was going to talk of
      love? How much from her desire to show regret about his accident?
      Something of both. But the wisdom of ages has hinted that there is a side
      of the bed which has a malign influence if you happen to get out on it;
      and this accident befalls some charming persons rather frequently. Perhaps
      it had befallen Gwendolen this morning. The hastening of her toilet, the
      way in which Bugle used the brush, the quality of the shilling serial
      mistakenly written for her amusement, the probabilities of the coming day,
      and, in short, social institutions generally, were all objectionable to
      her. It was not that she was out of temper, but that the world was not
      equal to the demands of her fine organism.
    </p>
    <p>
      However it might be, Rex saw an awful majesty about her as she entered and
      put out her hand to him, without the least approach to a smile in eyes or
      mouth. The fun which had moved her in the evening had quite evaporated
      from the image of his accident, and the whole affair seemed stupid to her.
      But she said with perfect propriety, &ldquo;I hope you are not much hurt,
      Rex; I deserve that you should reproach me for your accident.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Rex, feeling the soul within him spreading
      itself like an attack of illness. &ldquo;There is hardly any thing the
      matter with me. I am so glad you had the pleasure: I would willingly pay
      for it by a tumble, only I was sorry to break the horse&rsquo;s knees.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen walked to the hearth and stood looking at the fire in the most
      inconvenient way for conversation, so that he could only get a side view
      of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father wants me to go to Southampton for the rest of the
      vacation,&rdquo; said Rex, his baritone trembling a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Southampton! That&rsquo;s a stupid place to go to, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, chilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be to me, because you would not be there.&rdquo; Silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you mind about me going away, Gwendolen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Every one is of consequence in this dreary country,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, curtly. The perception that poor Rex wanted to be tender
      made her curl up and harden like a sea-anemone at the touch of a finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you angry with me, Gwendolen? Why do you treat me in this way
      all at once?&rdquo; said Rex, flushing, and with more spirit in his voice,
      as if he too were capable of being angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen looked round at him and smiled. &ldquo;Treat you? Nonsense! I am
      only rather cross. Why did you come so very early? You must expect to find
      tempers in dishabille.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be as cross with me as you like&mdash;only don&rsquo;t treat me
      with indifference,&rdquo; said Rex, imploringly. &ldquo;All the happiness
      of my life depends on your loving me&mdash;if only a little&mdash;better
      than any one else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to take her hand, but she hastily eluded his grasp and moved to
      the other end of the hearth, facing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t make love to me! I hate it!&rdquo; she looked at
      him fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rex turned pale and was silent, but could not take his eyes off her, and
      the impetus was not yet exhausted that made hers dart death at him.
      Gwendolen herself could not have foreseen that she should feel in this
      way. It was all a sudden, new experience to her. The day before she had
      been quite aware that her cousin was in love with her; she did not mind
      how much, so that he said nothing about it; and if any one had asked her
      why she objected to love-making speeches, she would have said, laughingly,
      &ldquo;Oh I am tired of them all in the books.&rdquo; But now the life of
      passion had begun negatively in her. She felt passionately averse to this
      volunteered love.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Rex at twenty the joy of life seemed at an end more absolutely than it
      can do to a man at forty. But before they had ceased to look at each
      other, he did speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that last word you have to say to me, Gwendolen? Will it always
      be so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not help seeing his wretchedness and feeling a little regret for
      the old Rex who had not offended her. Decisively, but yet with some return
      of kindness, she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About making love? Yes. But I don&rsquo;t dislike you for anything
      else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was just a perceptible pause before he said a low &ldquo;good-bye.&rdquo;
      and passed out of the room. Almost immediately after, she heard the heavy
      hall door bang behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow, too, had heard Rex&rsquo;s hasty departure, and presently
      came into the drawing-room, where she found Gwendolen seated on the low
      couch, her face buried, and her hair falling over her figure like a
      garment. She was sobbing bitterly. &ldquo;My child, my child, what is it?&rdquo;
      cried the mother, who had never before seen her darling struck down in
      this way, and felt something of the alarmed anguish that women, feel at
      the sight of overpowering sorrow in a strong man; for this child had been
      her ruler. Sitting down by her with circling arms, she pressed her cheek
      against Gwendolen&rsquo;s head, and then tried to draw it upward.
      Gwendolen gave way, and letting her head rest against her mother, cried
      out sobbingly, &ldquo;Oh, mamma, what can become of my life? there is
      nothing worth living for!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, dear?&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow. Usually she herself had been
      rebuked by her daughter for involuntary signs of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never love anybody. I can&rsquo;t love people. I hate them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time will come, dear, the time will come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen was more and more convulsed with sobbing; but putting her arms
      round her mother&rsquo;s neck with an almost painful clinging, she said
      brokenly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear any one to be very near me but you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the mother began to sob, for this spoiled child had never shown such
      dependence on her before: and so they clung to each other.

      There was a much more lasting trouble at the rectory. Rex arrived there
      only to throw himself on his bed in a state of apparent apathy, unbroken
      till the next day, when it began to be interrupted by more positive signs
      of illness. Nothing could be said about his going to Southampton: instead
      of that, the chief thought of his mother and Anna was how to tend this
      patient who did not want to be well, and from being the brightest, most
      grateful spirit in the household, was metamorphosed into an irresponsive,
      dull-eyed creature who met all affectionate attempts with a murmur of
      &ldquo;Let me alone.&rdquo; His father looked beyond the crisis, and
      believed it to be the shortest way out of an unlucky affair; but he was
      sorry for the inevitable suffering, and went now and then to sit by him in
      silence for a few minutes, parting with a gentle pressure of his hand on
      Rex&rsquo;s blank brow, and a &ldquo;God bless you, my boy.&rdquo; Warham
      and the younger children used to peep round the edge of the door to see
      this incredible thing of their lively brother being laid low; but fingers
      were immediately shaken at them to drive them back. The guardian who was
      always there was Anna, and her little hand was allowed to rest within her
      brother&rsquo;s, though he never gave it a welcoming pressure. Her soul
      was divided between anguish for Rex and reproach of Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is wicked of me, but I think I never <i>can</i> love her
      again,&rdquo; came as the recurrent burden of poor little Anna&rsquo;s
      inward monody. And even Mrs. Gascoigne had an angry feeling toward her
      niece which she could not refrain from expressing (apologetically) to her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of course it is better, and we ought to be thankful that she
      is not in love with the poor boy; but really. Henry, I think she is hard;
      she has the heart of a coquette. I can not help thinking that she must
      have made him believe something, or the disappointment would not have
      taken hold of him in that way. And some blame attaches to poor Fanny; she
      is quite blind about that girl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gascoigne answered imperatively: &ldquo;The less said on that point
      the better, Nancy. I ought to have been more awake myself. As to the boy,
      be thankful if nothing worse ever happens to him. Let the thing die out as
      quickly as possible; and especially with regard to Gwendolen&mdash;let it
      be as if it had never been.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector&rsquo;s dominant feeling was that there had been a great
      escape. Gwendolen in love with Rex in return would have made a much harder
      problem, the solution of which might have been taken out of his hands. But
      he had to go through some further difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fine morning Rex asked for his bath, and made his toilet as usual.
      Anna, full of excitement at this change, could do nothing but listen for
      his coming down, and at last hearing his step, ran to the foot of the
      stairs to meet him. For the first time he gave her a faint smile, but it
      looked so melancholy on his pale face that she could hardly help crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nannie!&rdquo; he said gently, taking her hand and leading her
      slowly along with him to the drawing-room. His mother was there, and when
      she came to kiss him, he said: &ldquo;What a plague I am!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat still and looked out of the bow-window on the lawn and shrubs
      covered with hoar-frost, across which the sun was sending faint occasional
      gleams:&mdash;something like that sad smile on Rex&rsquo;s face, Anna
      thought. He felt as if he had had a resurrection into a new world, and did
      not know what to do with himself there, the old interests being left
      behind. Anna sat near him, pretending to work, but really watching him
      with yearning looks. Beyond the garden hedge there was a road where wagons
      and carts sometimes went on field-work: a railed opening was made in the
      hedge, because the upland with its bordering wood and clump of ash-trees
      against the sky was a pretty sight. Presently there came along a wagon
      laden with timber; the horses were straining their grand muscles, and the
      driver having cracked his whip, ran along anxiously to guide the leader&rsquo;s
      head, fearing a swerve. Rex seemed to be shaken into attention, rose and
      looked till the last quivering trunk of the timber had disappeared, and
      then walked once or twice along the room. Mrs. Gascoigne was no longer
      there, and when he came to sit down again, Anna, seeing a return of speech
      in her brother&rsquo;s eyes, could not resist the impulse to bring a
      little stool and seat herself against his knee, looking up at him with an
      expression which seemed to say, &ldquo;Do speak to me.&rdquo; And he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;m thinking of, Nannie. I will go
      to Canada, or somewhere of that sort.&rdquo; (Rex had not studied the
      character of our colonial possessions.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Rex, not for always!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to get my bread there. I should like to build a hut, and work
      hard at clearing, and have everything wild about me, and a great wide
      quiet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not take me with you?&rdquo; said Anna, the big tears coming
      fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like it better than anything; and settlers go with their
      families. I would sooner go there than stay here in England. I could make
      the fires, and mend the clothes, and cook the food; and I could learn how
      to make the bread before we went. It would be nicer than anything&mdash;like
      playing at life over again, as we used to do when we made our tent with
      the drugget, and had our little plates and dishes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father and mother would not let you go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think they would, when I explained everything. It would save
      money; and papa would have more to bring up the boys with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was further talk of the same practical kind at intervals, and it
      ended in Rex&rsquo;s being obliged to consent that Anna should go with him
      when he spoke to his father on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it was when the rector was alone in his study. Their mother
      would become reconciled to whatever he decided on, but mentioned to her
      first, the question would have distressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my children!&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne, cheerfully, as they
      entered. It was a comfort to see Rex about again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May we sit down with you a little, papa?&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;Rex
      has something to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a noticeable group that these three creatures made, each of them
      with a face of the same structural type&mdash;the straight brow, the nose
      suddenly straightened from an intention of being aquiline, the short upper
      lip, the short but strong and well-hung chin: there was even the same tone
      of complexion and set of the eye. The gray-haired father was at once
      massive and keen-looking; there was a perpendicular line in his brow which
      when he spoke with any force of interest deepened; and the habit of ruling
      gave him an air of reserved authoritativeness. Rex would have seemed a
      vision of his father&rsquo;s youth, if it had been possible to imagine Mr.
      Gascoigne without distinct plans and without command, smitten with a heart
      sorrow, and having no more notion of concealment than a sick animal; and
      Anna was a tiny copy of Rex, with hair drawn back and knotted, her face
      following his in its changes of expression, as if they had one soul
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know all about what has upset me, father,&rdquo; Rex began, and
      Mr. Gascoigne nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite done up for life in this part of the world. I am sure it
      will be no use my going back to Oxford. I couldn&rsquo;t do any reading. I
      should fail, and cause you expense for nothing. I want to have your
      consent to take another course, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gascoigne nodded more slowly, the perpendicular line on his brow
      deepened, and Anna&rsquo;s trembling increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would allow me a small outfit, I should like to go to the
      colonies and work on the land there.&rdquo; Rex thought the vagueness of
      the phrase prudential; &ldquo;the colonies&rdquo; necessarily embracing
      more advantages, and being less capable of being rebutted on a single
      ground than any particular settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, and with me, papa,&rdquo; said Anna, not bearing to be left out
      from the proposal even temporarily. &ldquo;Rex would want some one to take
      care of him, you know&mdash;some one to keep house. And we shall never,
      either of us, be married. And I should cost nothing, and I should be so
      happy. I know it would be hard to leave you and mamma; but there are all
      the others to bring up, and we two should be no trouble to you any more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna had risen from her seat, and used the feminine argument of going
      closer to her papa as she spoke. He did not smile, but he drew her on his
      knee and held her there, as if to put her gently out of the question while
      he spoke to Rex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will admit that my experience gives me some power of judging
      for you, and that I can probably guide you in practical matters better
      than you can guide yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rex was obliged to say, &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And perhaps you will admit&mdash;though I don&rsquo;t wish to press
      that point&mdash;that you are bound in duty to consider my judgment and
      wishes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never yet placed myself in opposition to you, sir.&rdquo;
      Rex in his secret soul could not feel that he was bound not to go to the
      colonies, but to go to Oxford again&mdash;which was the point in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will do so if you persist in setting your mind toward a
      rash and foolish procedure, and deafening yourself to considerations which
      my experience of life assures me of. You think, I suppose, that you have
      had a shock which has changed all your inclinations, stupefied your
      brains, unfitted you for anything but manual labor, and given you a
      dislike to society? Is that what you believe?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like that. I shall never be up to the sort of work I must
      do to live in this part of the world. I have not the spirit for it. I
      shall never be the same again. And without any disrespect to you, father,
      I think a young fellow should be allowed to choose his way of life, if he
      does nobody any harm. There are plenty to stay at home, and those who like
      might be allowed to go where there are empty places.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose I am convinced on good evidence&mdash;as I am&mdash;that
      this state of mind of yours is transient, and that if you went off as you
      propose, you would by-and-by repent, and feel that you had let yourself
      slip back from the point you have been gaining by your education till now?
      Have you not strength of mind enough to see that you had better act on my
      assurance for a time, and test it? In my opinion, so far from agreeing
      with you that you should be free to turn yourself into a colonist and work
      in your shirt-sleeves with spade and hatchet&mdash;in my opinion you have
      no right whatever to expatriate yourself until you have honestly
      endeavored to turn to account the education you have received here. I say
      nothing of the grief to your mother and me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry; but what can I do? I can&rsquo;t study&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      certain,&rdquo; said Rex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not just now, perhaps. You will have to miss a term. I have made
      arrangements for you&mdash;how you are to spend the next two months. But I
      confess I am disappointed in you, Rex. I thought you had more sense than
      to take up such ideas&mdash;to suppose that because you have fallen into a
      very common trouble, such as most men have to go through, you are loosened
      from all bonds of duty&mdash;just as if your brain had softened and you
      were no longer a responsible being.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What could Rex say? Inwardly he was in a state of rebellion, but he had no
      arguments to meet his father&rsquo;s; and while he was feeling, in spite
      of any thing that might be said, that he should like to go off to &ldquo;the
      colonies&rdquo; to-morrow, it lay in a deep fold of his consciousness that
      he ought to feel&mdash;if he had been a better fellow he would have felt&mdash;more
      about his old ties. This is the sort of faith we live by in our soul
      sicknesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rex got up from his seat, as if he held the conference to be at an end.
      &ldquo;You assent to my arrangement, then?&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne, with
      that distinct resolution of tone which seems to hold one in a vise.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little pause before Rex answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try what I
      can do, sir. I can&rsquo;t promise.&rdquo; His thought was, that trying
      would be of no use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father kept Anna, holding her fast, though she wanted to follow Rex.
      &ldquo;Oh, papa,&rdquo; she said, the tears coming with her words when the
      door had closed; &ldquo;it is very hard for him. Doesn&rsquo;t he look
      ill?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but he will soon be better; it will all blow over. And now,
      Anna, be as quiet as a mouse about it all. Never let it be mentioned when
      he is gone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, papa. But I would not be like Gwendolen for any thing&mdash;to
      have people fall in love with me so. It is very dreadful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna dared not say that she was disappointed at not being allowed to go to
      the colonies with Rex; but that was her secret feeling, and she often
      afterward went inwardly over the whole affair, saying to herself, &ldquo;I
      should have done with going out, and gloves, and crinoline, and having to
      talk when I am taken to dinner&mdash;and all that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to mark the time, and connect the course of individual lives with
      the historic stream, for all classes of thinkers. This was the period when
      the broadening of gauge in crinolines seemed to demand an agitation for
      the general enlargement of churches, ball-rooms, and vehicles. But Anna
      Gascoigne&rsquo;s figure would only allow the size of skirt manufactured
      for young ladies of fourteen.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I&rsquo;ll tell thee, Berthold, what men&rsquo;s hopes are like:
  A silly child that, quivering with joy,
  Would cast its little mimic fishing-line
  Baited with loadstone for a bowl of toys
  In the salt ocean.
</pre>
    <p>
      Eight months after the arrival of the family at Offendene, that is to say
      in the end of the following June, a rumor was spread in the neighborhood
      which to many persons was matter of exciting interest. It had no reference
      to the results of the American war, but it was one which touched all
      classes within a certain circuit round Wanchester: the corn-factors, the
      brewers, the horse-dealers, and saddlers, all held it a laudable thing,
      and one which was to be rejoiced in on abstract grounds, as showing the
      value of an aristocracy in a free country like England; the blacksmith in
      the hamlet of Diplow felt that a good time had come round; the wives of
      laboring men hoped their nimble boys of ten or twelve would be taken into
      employ by the gentlemen in livery; and the farmers about Diplow admitted,
      with a tincture of bitterness and reserve, that a man might now again
      perhaps have an easier market or exchange for a rick of old hay or a
      wagon-load of straw. If such were the hopes of low persons not in society,
      it may be easily inferred that their betters had better reasons for
      satisfaction, probably connected with the pleasures of life rather than
      its business. Marriage, however, must be considered as coming under both
      heads; and just as when a visit of majesty is announced, the dream of
      knighthood or a baronetcy is to be found under various municipal
      nightcaps, so the news in question raised a floating indeterminate vision
      of marriage in several well-bred imaginations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news was that Diplow Hall, Sir Hugo Mallinger&rsquo;s place, which had
      for a couple of years turned its white window-shutters in a painfully
      wall-eyed manner on its fine elms and beeches, its lilied pool and grassy
      acres specked with deer, was being prepared for a tenant, and was for the
      rest of the summer and through the hunting season to be inhabited in a
      fitting style both as to house and stable. But not by Sir Hugo himself: by
      his nephew, Mr. Mallinger Grandcourt, who was presumptive heir to the
      baronetcy, his uncle&rsquo;s marriage having produced nothing but girls.
      Nor was this the only contingency with which fortune flattered young
      Grandcourt, as he was pleasantly called; for while the chance of the
      baronetcy came through his father, his mother had given a baronial streak
      to his blood, so that if certain intervening persons slightly painted in
      the middle distance died, he would become a baron and peer of this realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the uneven allotment of nature that the male bird alone has the
      tuft, but we have not yet followed the advice of hasty philosophers who
      would have us copy nature entirely in these matters; and if Mr. Mallinger
      Grandcourt became a baronet or a peer, his wife would share the title&mdash;which
      in addition to his actual fortune was certainly a reason why that wife,
      being at present unchosen, should be thought of by more than one person
      with a sympathetic interest as a woman sure to be well provided for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some readers of this history will doubtless regard it as incredible that
      people should construct matrimonial prospects on the mere report that a
      bachelor of good fortune and possibilities was coming within reach, and
      will reject the statement as a mere outflow of gall: they will aver that
      neither they nor their first cousins have minds so unbridled; and that in
      fact this is not human nature, which would know that such speculations
      might turn out to be fallacious, and would therefore not entertain them.
      But, let it be observed, nothing is here narrated of human nature
      generally: the history in its present stage concerns only a few people in
      a corner of Wessex&mdash;whose reputation, however, was unimpeached, and
      who, I am in the proud position of being able to state, were all on
      visiting terms with persons of rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were the Arrowpoints, for example, in their beautiful place at
      Quetcham: no one could attribute sordid views in relation to their
      daughter&rsquo;s marriage to parents who could leave her at least half a
      million; but having affectionate anxieties about their Catherine&rsquo;s
      position (she having resolutely refused Lord Slogan, an unexceptionable
      Irish peer, whose estate wanted nothing but drainage and population), they
      wondered, perhaps from something more than a charitable impulse, whether
      Mr. Grandcourt was good-looking, of sound constitution, virtuous, or at
      least reformed, and if liberal-conservative, not too liberal-conservative;
      and without wishing anybody to die, thought his succession to the title an
      event to be desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Arrowpoints had such ruminations, it is the less surprising that
      they were stimulated in Mr. Gascoigne, who for being a clergyman was not
      the less subject to the anxieties of a parent and guardian; and we have
      seen how both he and Mrs. Gascoigne might by this time have come to feel
      that he was overcharged with the management of young creatures who were
      hardly to be held in with bit or bridle, or any sort of metaphor that
      would stand for judicious advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, people did not tell each other all they felt and thought about
      young Grandcourt&rsquo;s advent: on no subject is this openness found
      prudently practicable&mdash;not even on the generation of acids, or the
      destination of the fixed stars: for either your contemporary with a mind
      turned toward the same subjects may find your ideas ingenious and
      forestall you in applying them, or he may have other views on acids and
      fixed stars, and think ill of you in consequence. Mr. Gascoigne did not
      ask Mr. Arrowpoint if he had any trustworthy source of information about
      Grandcourt considered as a husband for a charming girl; nor did Mrs.
      Arrowpoint observe to Mrs. Davilow that if the possible peer sought a wife
      in the neighborhood of Diplow, the only reasonable expectation was that he
      would offer his hand to Catherine, who, however, would not accept him
      unless he were in all respects fitted to secure her happiness. Indeed,
      even to his wife the rector was silent as to the contemplation of any
      matrimonial result, from the probability that Mr. Grandcourt would see
      Gwendolen at the next Archery Meeting; though Mrs. Gascoigne&rsquo;s mind
      was very likely still more active in the same direction. She had said
      interjectionally to her sister, &ldquo;It would be a mercy, Fanny, if that
      girl were well married!&rdquo; to which Mrs. Davilow discerning some
      criticism of her darling in the fervor of that wish, had not chosen to
      make any audible reply, though she had said inwardly, &ldquo;You will not
      get her to marry for your pleasure&rdquo;; the mild mother becoming rather
      saucy when she identified herself with her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her husband Mrs. Gascoigne said, &ldquo;I hear Mr. Grandcourt has got
      two places of his own, but he comes to Diplow for the hunting. It is to be
      hoped he will set a good example in the neighborhood. Have you heard what
      sort of a young man he is, Henry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gascoigne had not heard; at least, if his male acquaintances had
      gossiped in his hearing, he was not disposed to repeat their gossip, or to
      give it any emphasis in his own mind. He held it futile, even if it had
      been becoming, to show any curiosity as to the past of a young man whose
      birth, wealth, and consequent leisure made many habits venial which under
      other circumstances would have been inexcusable. Whatever Grandcourt had
      done, he had not ruined himself; and it is well-known that in gambling,
      for example, whether of the business or holiday sort, a man who has the
      strength of mind to leave off when he has only ruined others, is a
      reformed character. This is an illustration merely: Mr. Gascoigne had not
      heard that Grandcourt had been a gambler; and we can hardly pronounce him
      singular in feeling that a landed proprietor with a mixture of noble blood
      in his veins was not to be an object of suspicious inquiry like a reformed
      character who offers himself as your butler or footman. Reformation, where
      a man can afford to do without it, can hardly be other than genuine.
      Moreover, it was not certain on any other showing hitherto, that Mr.
      Grandcourt had needed reformation more than other young men in the ripe
      youth of five-and-thirty; and, at any rate, the significance of what he
      had been must be determined by what he actually was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow, too, although she would not respond to her sister&rsquo;s
      pregnant remark, could not be inwardly indifferent to an advent that might
      promise a brilliant lot for Gwendolen. A little speculation on &ldquo;what
      may be&rdquo; comes naturally, without encouragement&mdash;comes
      inevitably in the form of images, when unknown persons are mentioned; and
      Mr. Grandcourt&rsquo;s name raised in Mrs. Davilow&rsquo;s mind first of
      all the picture of a handsome, accomplished, excellent young man whom she
      would be satisfied with as a husband for her daughter; but then came the
      further speculation&mdash;would Gwendolen be satisfied with him? There was
      no knowing what would meet that girl&rsquo;s taste or touch her affections&mdash;it
      might be something else than excellence; and thus the image of the perfect
      suitor gave way before a fluctuating combination of qualities that might
      be imagined to win Gwendolen&rsquo;s heart. In the difficulty of arriving
      at the particular combination which would insure that result, the mother
      even said to herself, &ldquo;It would not signify about her being in love,
      if she would only accept the right person.&rdquo; For whatever marriage
      had been for herself, how could she the less desire it for her daughter?
      The difference her own misfortunes made was, that she never dared to dwell
      much to Gwendolen on the desirableness of marriage, dreading an answer
      something like that of the future Madame Roland, when her gentle mother
      urging the acceptance of a suitor, said, &ldquo;Tu seras heureuse, ma
      chère.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oui, maman, comme toi.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In relation to the problematic Mr. Grandcourt least of all would Mrs.
      Davilow have willingly let fall a hint of the aerial castle-building which
      she had the good taste to be ashamed of; for such a hint was likely enough
      to give an adverse poise to Gwendolen&rsquo;s own thought, and make her
      detest the desirable husband beforehand. Since that scene after poor Rex&rsquo;s
      farewell visit, the mother had felt a new sense of peril in touching the
      mystery of her child&rsquo;s feeling, and in rashly determining what was
      her welfare: only she could think of welfare in no other shape than
      marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discussion of the dress that Gwendolen was to wear at the Archery
      Meeting was a relevant topic, however; and when it had been decided that
      as a touch of color on her white cashmere, nothing, for her complexion,
      was comparable to pale green&mdash;a feather which she was trying in her
      hat before the looking-glass having settled the question&mdash;Mrs.
      Davilow felt her ears tingle when Gwendolen, suddenly throwing herself
      into the attitude of drawing her bow, said with a look of comic enjoyment,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I pity all the other girls at the Archery Meeting&mdash;all
      thinking of Mr. Grandcourt! And they have not a shadow of a chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow had not the presence of mind to answer immediately, and
      Gwendolen turned round quickly toward her, saying, wickedly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you know they have not, mamma. You and my uncle and aunt&mdash;you
      all intend him to fall in love with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow, piqued into a little stratagem, said, &ldquo;Oh, my, dear,
      that is not so certain. Miss Arrowpoint has charms which you have not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but they demand thought. My arrow will pierce him before he
      has time for thought. He will declare himself my slave&mdash;I shall send
      him round the world to bring me back the wedding ring of a happy woman&mdash;in
      the meantime all the men who are between him and the title will die of
      different diseases&mdash;he will come back Lord Grandcourt&mdash;but
      without the ring&mdash;and fall at my feet. I shall laugh at him&mdash;he
      will rise in resentment&mdash;I shall laugh more&mdash;he will call for
      his steed and ride to Quetcham, where he will find Miss Arrowpoint just
      married to a needy musician, Mrs. Arrowpoint tearing her cap off, and Mr.
      Arrowpoint standing by. Exit Lord Grandcourt, who returns to Diplow, and,
      like M. Jabot, <i>change de linge</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Was ever any young witch like this? You thought of hiding things from her&mdash;sat
      upon your secret and looked innocent, and all the while she knew by the
      corner of your eye that it was exactly five pounds ten you were sitting
      on! As well turn the key to keep out the damp! It was probable that by
      dint of divination she already knew more than any one else did of Mr.
      Grandcourt. That idea in Mrs. Davilow&rsquo;s mind prompted the sort of
      question which often comes without any other apparent reason than the
      faculty of speech and the not knowing what to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what kind of a man do you imagine him to be, Gwendolen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see!&rdquo; said the witch, putting her forefinger to her
      lips, with a little frown, and then stretching out the finger with
      decision. &ldquo;Short&mdash;just above my shoulder&mdash;trying to make
      himself tall by turning up his mustache and keeping his beard long&mdash;a
      glass in his right eye to give him an air of distinction&mdash;a strong
      opinion about his waistcoat, but uncertain and trimming about the weather,
      on which he will try to draw me out. He will stare at me all the while,
      and the glass in his eye will cause him to make horrible faces, especially
      when he smiles in a flattering way. I shall cast down my eyes in
      consequence, and he will perceive that I am not indifferent to his
      attentions. I shall dream that night that I am looking at the
      extraordinary face of a magnified insect&mdash;and the next morning he
      will make an offer of his hand; the sequel as before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a portrait of some one you have seen already, Gwen. Mr.
      Grandcourt may be a delightful young man for what you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a high note of careless
      admission, taking off her best hat and turning it round on her hand
      contemplatively. &ldquo;I wonder what sort of behavior a delightful young
      man would have? I know he would have hunters and racers, and a London
      house and two country-houses&mdash;one with battlements and another with a
      veranda. And I feel sure that with a little murdering he might get a
      title.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The irony of this speech was of the doubtful sort that has some genuine
      belief mixed up with it. Poor Mrs. Davilow felt uncomfortable under it.
      Her own meanings being usually literal and in intention innocent; and she
      said with a distressed brow:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk in that way, child, for heaven&rsquo;s sake! you
      do read such books&mdash;they give you such ideas of everything. I declare
      when your aunt and I were your age we knew nothing about wickedness. I
      think it was better so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not bring me up in that way, mamma?&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen. But immediately perceiving in the crushed look and rising sob
      that she had given a deep wound, she tossed down her hat and knelt at her
      mother&rsquo;s feet crying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, mamma! I was only speaking in fun. I meant nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I, Gwendolen?&rdquo; said poor Mrs. Davilow, unable to
      hear the retraction, and sobbing violently while she made the effort to
      speak. &ldquo;Your will was always too strong for me&mdash;if everything
      else had been different.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This disjoined logic was intelligible enough to the daughter. &ldquo;Dear
      mamma, I don&rsquo;t find fault with you&mdash;I love you,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, really compunctious. &ldquo;How can you help what I am?
      Besides, I am very charming. Come, now.&rdquo; Here Gwendolen with her
      handkerchief gently rubbed away her mother&rsquo;s tears. &ldquo;Really&mdash;I
      am contented with myself. I like myself better than I should have liked my
      aunt and you. How dreadfully dull you must have been!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such tender cajolery served to quiet the mother, as it had often done
      before after like collisions. Not that the collisions had often been
      repeated at the same point; for in the memory of both they left an
      association of dread with the particular topics which had occasioned them:
      Gwendolen dreaded the unpleasant sense of compunction toward her mother,
      which was the nearest approach to self-condemnation and self-distrust that
      she had known; and Mrs. Davilow&rsquo;s timid maternal conscience dreaded
      whatever had brought on the slightest hint of reproach. Hence, after this
      little scene, the two concurred in excluding Mr. Grandcourt from their
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Gascoigne once or twice referred to him, Mrs. Davilow feared
      least Gwendolen should betray some of her alarming keen-sightedness about
      what was probably in her uncle&rsquo;s mind; but the fear was not
      justified. Gwendolen knew certain differences in the characters with which
      she was concerned as birds know climate and weather; and for the very
      reason that she was determined to evade her uncle&rsquo;s control, she was
      determined not to clash with him. The good understanding between them was
      much fostered by their enjoyment of archery together: Mr. Gascoigne, as
      one of the best bowmen in Wessex, was gratified to find the elements of
      like skill in his niece; and Gwendolen was the more careful not to lose
      the shelter of his fatherly indulgence, because since the trouble with Rex
      both Mrs. Gascoigne and Anna had been unable to hide what she felt to be a
      very unreasonable alienation from her. Toward Anna she took some pains to
      behave with a regretful affectionateness; but neither of them dared to
      mention Rex&rsquo;s name, and Anna, to whom the thought of him was part of
      the air she breathed, was ill at ease with the lively cousin who had
      ruined his happiness. She tried dutifully to repress any sign of her
      changed feeling; but who in pain can imitate the glance and hand-touch of
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This unfair resentment had rather a hardening effect on Gwendolen, and
      threw her into a more defiant temper. Her uncle too might be offended if
      she refused the next person who fell in love with her; and one day when
      that idea was in her mind she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, I see now why girls are glad to be married&mdash;to escape
      being expected to please everybody but themselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily, Mr. Middleton was gone without having made any avowal; and
      notwithstanding the admiration for the handsome Miss Harleth, extending
      perhaps over thirty square miles in a part of Wessex well studded with
      families whose numbers included several disengaged young men, each glad to
      seat himself by the lively girl with whom it was so easy to get on in
      conversation,&mdash;notwithstanding these grounds for arguing that
      Gwendolen was likely to have other suitors more explicit than the cautious
      curate, the fact was not so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Care has been taken not only that the trees should not sweep the stars
      down, but also that every man who admires a fair girl should not be
      enamored of her, and even that every man who is enamored should not
      necessarily declare himself. There are various refined shapes in which the
      price of corn, known to be potent cause in their relation, might, if
      inquired into, show why a young lady, perfect in person, accomplishments,
      and costume, has not the trouble of rejecting many offers; and nature&rsquo;s
      order is certainly benignant in not obliging us one and all to be
      desperately in love with the most admirable mortal we have ever seen.
      Gwendolen, we know, was far from holding that supremacy in the minds of
      all observers. Besides, it was but a poor eight months since she had come
      to Offendene, and some inclinations become manifest slowly, like the
      sunward creeping of plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      In face of this fact that not one of the eligible young men already in the
      neighborhood had made Gwendolen an offer, why should Mr. Grandcourt be
      thought of as likely to do what they had left undone?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps because he was thought of as still more eligible; since a great
      deal of what passes for likelihood in the world is simply the reflex of a
      wish. Mr. and Mrs. Arrowpoint, for example, having no anxiety that Miss
      Harleth should make a brilliant marriage, had quite a different likelihood
      in their minds.

      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  <i>1st Gent.</i> What woman should be? Sir, consult the taste
                   Of marriageable men. This planet&rsquo;s store
                   In iron, cotton, wool, or chemicals&mdash;
                   All matter rendered to our plastic skill,
                   Is wrought in shapes responsive to demand;
                   The market&rsquo;s pulse makes index high or low,
                   By rule sublime. Our daughters must be wives,
                   And to the wives must be what men will choose;
                   Men&rsquo;s taste is woman&rsquo;s test. You mark the phrase?
                   &lsquo;Tis good, I think?&mdash;the sense well-winged and poised
                   With t&rsquo;s and s&rsquo;s.
  <i>2nd Gent.</i>                      Nay, but turn it round;
                   Give us the test of taste. A fine <i>menu</i>&mdash;
                   Is it to-day what Roman epicures
                   Insisted that a gentleman must eat
                   To earn the dignity of dining well?
</pre>
    <p>
      Brackenshaw Park, where the archery meeting was held, looked out from its
      gentle heights far over the neighboring valley to the outlying eastern
      downs and the broad, slow rise of cultivated country, hanging like a vast
      curtain toward the west. The castle which stood on the highest platform of
      the clustered hills, was built of rough-hewn limestone, full of lights and
      shadows made by the dark dust of lichens and the washings of the rain.
      Masses of beech and fir sheltered it on the north, and spread down here
      and there along the green slopes like flocks seeking the water which
      gleamed below. The archery-ground was a carefully-kept enclosure on a bit
      of table-land at the farthest end of the park, protected toward the
      southwest by tall elms and a thick screen of hollies, which kept the
      gravel walk and the bit of newly-mown turf where the targets were placed
      in agreeable afternoon shade. The Archery Hall with an arcade in front
      showed like a white temple against the greenery on the north side.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could make a better background for the flower-groups of ladies,
      moving and bowing and turning their necks as it would become the leisurely
      lilies to do if they took to locomotion. The sounds too were very pleasant
      to hear, even when the military band from Wanchester ceased to play:
      musical laughs in all the registers and a harmony of happy, friendly
      speeches, now rising toward mild excitement, now sinking to an agreeable
      murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      No open-air amusement could be much freer from those noisy, crowding
      conditions which spoil most modern pleasures; no Archery Meeting could be
      more select, the number of friends accompanying the members being
      restricted by an award of tickets, so as to keep the maximum within the
      limits of convenience for the dinner and ball to be held in the castle.
      Within the enclosure no plebeian spectators were admitted except Lord
      Brackenshaw&rsquo;s tenants and their families, and of these it was
      chiefly the feminine members who used the privilege, bringing their little
      boys and girls or younger brothers and sisters. The males among them
      relieved the insipidity of the entertainment by imaginative betting, in
      which the stake was &ldquo;anything you like,&rdquo; on their favorite
      archers; but the young maidens, having a different principle of
      discrimination, were considering which of those sweetly-dressed ladies
      they would choose to be, if the choice were allowed them. Probably the
      form these rural souls would most have striven for as a tabernacle, was
      some other than Gwendolen&rsquo;s&mdash;one with more pink in her cheeks
      and hair of the most fashionable yellow; but among the male judges in the
      ranks immediately surrounding her there was unusual unanimity in
      pronouncing her the finest girl present.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder she enjoyed her existence on that July day. Pre-eminence is
      sweet to those who love it, even under mediocre circumstances. Perhaps it
      was not quite mythical that a slave has been proud to be bought first; and
      probably a barn-door fowl on sale, though he may not have understood
      himself to be called the best of a bad lot, may have a self-informed
      consciousness of his relative importance, and strut consoled. But for
      complete enjoyment the outward and the inward must concur. And that
      concurrence was happening to Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can deny that bows and arrows are among the prettiest weapons in the
      world for feminine forms to play with? They prompt attitudes full of grace
      and power, where that fine concentration of energy seen in all
      markmanship, is freed from associations of bloodshed. The time-honored
      British resource of &ldquo;killing something&rdquo; is no longer carried
      on with bow and quiver; bands defending their passes against an invading
      nation fight under another sort of shade than a cloud of arrows; and
      poisoned darts are harmless survivals either in rhetoric or in regions
      comfortably remote. Archery has no ugly smell of brimstone; breaks nobody&rsquo;s
      shins, breeds no athletic monsters; its only danger is that of failing,
      which for generous blood is enough to mould skilful action. And among the
      Brackenshaw archers the prizes were all of the nobler symbolic kind; not
      properly to be carried off in a parcel, degrading honor into gain; but the
      gold arrow and the silver, the gold star and the silver, to be worn for a
      long time in sign of achievement and then transferred to the next who did
      excellently. These signs of pre-eminence had the virtue of wreaths without
      their inconveniences, which might have produced a melancholy effect in the
      heat of the ball-room. Altogether the Brackenshaw Archery Club was an
      institution framed with good taste, so as not to have by necessity any
      ridiculous incidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to-day all incalculable elements were in its favor. There was mild
      warmth, and no wind to disturb either hair or drapery or the course of the
      arrow; all skillful preparation had fair play, and when there was a
      general march to extract the arrows, the promenade of joyous young
      creatures in light speech and laughter, the graceful movement in common
      toward a common object, was a show worth looking at. Here Gwendolen seemed
      a Calypso among her nymphs. It was in her attitudes and movements that
      every one was obliged to admit her surpassing charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl is like a high-mettled racer,&rdquo; said Lord
      Brackenshaw to young Clintock, one of the invited spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First chop! tremendously pretty too,&rdquo; said the elegant
      Grecian, who had been paying her assiduous attention; &ldquo;I never saw
      her look better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps she had never looked so well. Her face was beaming with young
      pleasure in which there was no malign rays of discontent; for being
      satisfied with her own chances, she felt kindly toward everybody and was
      satisfied with the universe. Not to have the highest distinction in rank,
      not to be marked out as an heiress, like Miss Arrowpoint, gave an added
      triumph in eclipsing those advantages. For personal recommendation she
      would not have cared to change the family group accompanying her for any
      other: her mamma&rsquo;s appearance would have suited an amiable duchess;
      her uncle and aunt Gascoigne with Anna made equally gratifying figures in
      their way; and Gwendolen was too full of joyous belief in herself to feel
      in the least jealous though Miss Arrowpoint was one of the best
      archeresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the reappearance of the formidable Herr Klesmer, which caused some
      surprise in the rest of the company, seemed only to fall in with Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      inclination to be amused. Short of Apollo himself, what great musical <i>maestro</i>
      could make a good figure at an archery meeting? There was a very satirical
      light in Gwendolen&rsquo;s eyes as she looked toward the Arrowpoint party
      on their first entrance, when the contrast between Klesmer and the average
      group of English country people seemed at its utmost intensity in the
      close neighborhood of his hosts&mdash;or patrons, as Mrs. Arrowpoint would
      have liked to hear them called, that she might deny the possibility of any
      longer patronizing genius, its royalty being universally acknowledged. The
      contrast might have amused a graver personage than Gwendolen. We English
      are a miscellaneous people, and any chance fifty of us will present many
      varieties of animal architecture or facial ornament; but it must be
      admitted that our prevailing expression is not that of a lively,
      impassioned race, preoccupied with the ideal and carrying the real as a
      mere make-weight. The strong point of the English gentleman pure is the
      easy style of his figure and clothing; he objects to marked ins and outs
      in his costume, and he also objects to looking inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fancy an assemblage where the men had all that ordinary stamp of the
      well-bred Englishman, watching the entrance of Herr Klesmer&mdash;his mane
      of hair floating backward in massive inconsistency with the chimney-pot
      hat, which had the look of having been put on for a joke above his
      pronounced but well-modeled features and powerful clear-shaven mouth and
      chin; his tall, thin figure clad in a way which, not being strictly
      English, was all the worse for its apparent emphasis of intention. Draped
      in a loose garment with a Florentine <i>berretta</i> on his head, he would
      have been fit to stand by the side of Leonardo de Vinci; but how when he
      presented himself in trousers which were not what English feeling demanded
      about the knees?&mdash;and when the fire that showed itself in his glances
      and the movements of his head, as he looked round him with curiosity, was
      turned into comedy by a hat which ruled that mankind should have
      well-cropped hair and a staid demeanor, such, for example, as Mr.
      Arrowsmith&rsquo;s, whose nullity of face and perfect tailoring might pass
      everywhere without ridicule? One feels why it is often better for
      greatness to be dead, and to have got rid of the outward man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many present knew Klesmer, or knew of him; but they had only seen him on
      candle-light occasions when he appeared simply as a musician, and he had
      not yet that supreme, world-wide celebrity which makes an artist great to
      the most ordinary people by their knowledge of his great expensiveness. It
      was literally a new light for them to see him in&mdash;presented
      unexpectedly on this July afternoon in an exclusive society: some were
      inclined to laugh, others felt a little disgust at the want of judgment
      shown by the Arrowpoints in this use of an introductory card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What extreme guys those artistic fellows usually are!&rdquo; said
      young Clintock to Gwendolen. &ldquo;Do look at the figure he cuts, bowing
      with his hand on his heart to Lady Brackenshaw&mdash;and Mrs. Arrowpoint&rsquo;s
      feather just reaching his shoulder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are one of the profane,&rdquo; said Gwendolen. &ldquo;You are
      blind to the majesty of genius. Herr Klesmer smites me with awe; I feel
      crushed in his presence; my courage all oozes from me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you understand all about his music.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a light laugh; &ldquo;it is
      he who understands all about mine and thinks it pitiable.&rdquo; Klesmer&rsquo;s
      verdict on her singing had been an easier joke to her since he had been
      struck by her <i>plastik</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not addressed to the ears of the future, I suppose. I&rsquo;m
      glad of that: it suits mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are very kind. But how remarkably well Miss Arrowpoint
      looks to-day! She would make quite a fine picture in that gold-colored
      dress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too splendid, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps a little too symbolical&mdash;too much like the
      figure of Wealth in an allegory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech of Gwendolen&rsquo;s had rather a malicious sound, but it was
      not really more than a bubble of fun. She did not wish Miss Arrowpoint or
      any one else to be out of the way, believing in her own good fortune even
      more than in her skill. The belief in both naturally grew stronger as the
      shooting went on, for she promised to achieve one of the best scores&mdash;a
      success which astonished every one in a new member; and to Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      temperament one success determined another. She trod on air, and all
      things pleasant seemed possible. The hour was enough for her, and she was
      not obliged to think what she should do next to keep her life at the due
      pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does the scoring stand, I wonder?&rdquo; said Lady Brackenshaw,
      a gracious personage who, adorned with two little girls and a boy of stout
      make, sat as lady paramount. Her lord had come up to her in one of the
      intervals of shooting. &ldquo;It seems to me that Miss Harleth is likely
      to win the gold arrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad, I think she will, if she carries it on! she is running Juliet
      Fenn hard. It is wonderful for one in her first year. Catherine is not up
      to her usual mark,&rdquo; continued his lordship, turning to the heiress&rsquo;s
      mother who sat near. &ldquo;But she got the gold arrow last time. And
      there&rsquo;s a luck even in these games of skill. That&rsquo;s better. It
      gives the hinder ones a chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catherine will be very glad for others to win,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Arrowpoint, &ldquo;she is so magnanimous. It was entirely her
      considerateness that made us bring Herr Klesmer instead of Canon Stopley,
      who had expressed a wish to come. For her own pleasure, I am sure she
      would rather have brought the Canon; but she is always thinking of others.
      I told her it was not quite <i>en règle</i> to bring one so far out of our
      own set; but she said, &lsquo;Genius itself is not <i>en règle</i>; it
      comes into the world to make new rules.&rsquo; And one must admit that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, to be sure,&rdquo; said Lord Brackenshaw, in a tone of careless
      dismissal, adding quickly, &ldquo;For my part, I am not magnanimous; I
      should like to win. But, confound it! I never have the chance now. I&rsquo;m
      getting old and idle. The young ones beat me. As old Nestor says&mdash;the
      gods don&rsquo;t give us everything at one time: I was a young fellow
      once, and now I am getting an old and wise one. Old, at any rate; which is
      a gift that comes to everybody if they live long enough, so it raises no
      jealousy.&rdquo; The Earl smiled comfortably at his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my lord, people who have been neighbors twenty years must not
      talk to each other about age,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint. &ldquo;Years,
      as the Tuscans say, are made for the letting of houses. But where is our
      new neighbor? I thought Mr. Grandcourt was to be here to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, by the way, so he was. The time&rsquo;s getting on too,&rdquo;
      said his lordship, looking at his watch. &ldquo;But he only got to Diplow
      the other day. He came to us on Tuesday and said he had been a little
      bothered. He may have been pulled in another direction. Why, Gascoigne!&rdquo;&mdash;the
      rector was just then crossing at a little distance with Gwendolen on his
      arm, and turned in compliance with the call&mdash;&ldquo;this is a little
      too bad; you not only beat us yourself, but you bring up your niece to
      beat all the archeresses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> rather scandalous in her to get the better of elder
      members,&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne, with much inward satisfaction curling
      his short upper lip. &ldquo;But it is not my doing, my lord. I only meant
      her to make a tolerable figure, without surpassing any one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my fault, either,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with pretty
      archness. &ldquo;If I am to aim, I can&rsquo;t help hitting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, that may be a fatal business for some people,&rdquo; said
      Lord Brackenshaw, good-humoredly; then taking out his watch and looking at
      Mrs. Arrowpoint again&mdash;&ldquo;The time&rsquo;s getting on, as you
      say. But Grandcourt is always late. I notice in town he&rsquo;s always
      late, and he&rsquo;s no bowman&mdash;understands nothing about it. But I
      told him he must come; he would see the flower of the neighborhood here.
      He asked about you&mdash;had seen Arrowpoint&rsquo;s card. I think you had
      not made his acquaintance in town. He has been a good deal abroad. People
      don&rsquo;t know him much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we are strangers,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint. &ldquo;But that
      is not what might have been expected. For his uncle Sir Hugo Mallinger and
      I are great friends when we meet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; uncles and nephews are not so likely to be seen
      together as uncles and nieces,&rdquo; said his lordship, smiling toward
      the rector. &ldquo;But just come with me one instant, Gascoigne, will you?
      I want to speak a word about the clout-shooting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen chose to go too and be deposited in the same group with her
      mamma and aunt until she had to shoot again. That Mr. Grandcourt might
      after all not appear on the archery-ground, had begun to enter into
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s thought as a possible deduction from the completeness of
      her pleasure. Under all her saucy satire, provoked chiefly by her
      divination that her friends thought of him as a desirable match for her,
      she felt something very far from indifference as to the impression she
      would make on him. True, he was not to have the slightest power over her
      (for Gwendolen had not considered that the desire to conquer is itself a
      sort of subjection); she had made up her mind that he was to be one of
      those complimentary and assiduously admiring men of whom even her narrow
      experience had shown her several with various-colored beards and various
      styles of bearing; and the sense that her friends would want her to think
      him delightful, gave her a resistant inclination to presuppose him
      ridiculous. But that was no reason why she could spare his presence: and
      even a passing prevision of trouble in case she despised and refused him,
      raised not the shadow of a wish that he should save her that trouble by
      showing no disposition to make her an offer. Mr. Grandcourt taking hardly
      any notice of her, and becoming shortly engaged to Miss Arrowpoint, was
      not a picture which flattered her imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence Gwendolen had been all ear to Lord Brackenshaw&rsquo;s mode of
      accounting for Grandcourt&rsquo;s non-appearance; and when he did arrive,
      no consciousness&mdash;not even Mrs. Arrowpoint&rsquo;s or Mr. Gascoigne&rsquo;s&mdash;was
      more awake to the fact than hers, although she steadily avoided looking
      toward any point where he was likely to be. There should be no slightest
      shifting of angles to betray that it was of any consequence to her whether
      the much-talked-of Mr. Mallinger Grandcourt presented himself or not. She
      became again absorbed in the shooting, and so resolutely abstained from
      looking round observantly that, even supposing him to have taken a
      conspicuous place among the spectators, it might be clear she was not
      aware of him. And all the while the certainty that he was there made a
      distinct thread in her consciousness. Perhaps her shooting was the better
      for it: at any rate, it gained in precision, and she at last raised a
      delightful storm of clapping and applause by three hits running in the
      gold&mdash;a feat which among the Brackenshaw archers had not the vulgar
      reward of a shilling poll-tax, but that of a special gold star to be worn
      on the breast. That moment was not only a happy one to herself&mdash;it
      was just what her mamma and her uncle would have chosen for her. There was
      a general falling into ranks to give her space that she might advance
      conspicuously to receive the gold star from the hands of Lady Brackenshaw;
      and the perfect movement of her fine form was certainly a pleasant thing
      to behold in the clear afternoon light when the shadows were long and
      still. She was the central object of that pretty picture, and every one
      present must gaze at her. That was enough: she herself was determined to
      see nobody in particular, or to turn her eyes any way except toward Lady
      Brackenshaw, but her thoughts undeniably turned in other ways. It entered
      a little into her pleasure that Herr Klesmer must be observing her at a
      moment when music was out of the question, and his superiority very far in
      the back-ground; for vanity is as ill at ease under indifference as
      tenderness is under a love which it cannot return; and the unconquered
      Klesmer threw a trace of his malign power even across her pleasant
      consciousness that Mr. Grandcourt was seeing her to the utmost advantage,
      and was probably giving her an admiration unmixed with criticism. She did
      not expect to admire <i>him</i>, but that was not necessary to her peace
      of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen met Lady Brackenshaw&rsquo;s gracious smile without blushing
      (which only came to her when she was taken by surprise), but with a
      charming gladness of expression, and then bent with easy grace to have the
      star fixed near her shoulder. That little ceremony had been over long
      enough for her to have exchanged playful speeches and received
      congratulations as she moved among the groups who were now interesting
      themselves in the results of the scoring; but it happened that she stood
      outside examining the point of an arrow with rather an absent air when
      Lord Brackenshaw came up to her and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Harleth, here is a gentleman who is not willing to wait any
      longer for an introduction. He has been getting Mrs. Davilow to send me
      with him. Will you allow me to introduce Mr. Mallinger Grandcourt?&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
    The beginning of an acquaintance whether with persons or things is to
    get a definite outline for our ignorance.
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Grandcourt&rsquo;s wish to be introduced had no suddenness for
      Gwendolen; but when Lord Brackenshaw moved aside a little for the
      prefigured stranger to come forward and she felt herself face to face with
      the real man, there was a little shock which flushed her cheeks and
      vexatiously deepened with her consciousness of it. The shock came from the
      reversal of her expectations: Grandcourt could hardly have been more
      unlike all her imaginary portraits of him. He was slightly taller than
      herself, and their eyes seemed to be on a level; there was not the
      faintest smile on his face as he looked at her, not a trace of
      self-consciousness or anxiety in his bearing: when he raised his hat he
      showed an extensive baldness surrounded with a mere fringe of
      reddish-blonde hair, but he also showed a perfect hand; the line of
      feature from brow to chin undisguised by beard was decidedly handsome,
      with only moderate departures from the perpendicular, and the slight
      whisker too was perpendicular. It was not possible for a human aspect to
      be freer from grimace or solicitous wrigglings: also it was perhaps not
      possible for a breathing man wide awake to look less animated. The correct
      Englishman, drawing himself up from his bow into rigidity, assenting
      severely, and seemed to be in a state of internal drill, suggests a
      suppressed vivacity, and may be suspected of letting go with some violence
      when he is released from parade; but Grandcourt&rsquo;s bearing had no
      rigidity, it inclined rather to the flaccid. His complexion had a faded
      fairness resembling that of an actress when bare of the artificial white
      and red; his long narrow gray eyes expressed nothing but indifference.
      Attempts at description are stupid: who can all at once describe a human
      being? Even when he is presented to us we only begin that knowledge of his
      appearance which must be completed by innumerable impressions under
      differing circumstances. We recognize the alphabet; we are not sure of the
      language. I am only mentioning the point that Gwendolen saw by the light
      of a prepared contrast in the first minutes of her meeting with
      Grandcourt: they were summed up in the words, &ldquo;He is not ridiculous.&rdquo;
      But forthwith Lord Brackenshaw was gone, and what is called conversation
      had begun, the first and constant element in it being that Grandcourt
      looked at Gwendolen persistently with a slightly exploring gaze, but
      without change of expression, while she only occasionally looked at him
      with a flash of observation a little softened by coquetry. Also, after her
      answers there was a longer or shorter pause before he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to think archery was a great bore,&rdquo; Grandcourt began.
      He spoke with a fine accent, but with a certain broken drawl, as of a
      distinguished personage with a distinguished cold on his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you converted to-day?&rdquo; said Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Pause, during which she imagined various degrees and modes of opinion
      about herself that might be entertained by Grandcourt.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, since I saw you shooting. In things of this sort one generally
      sees people missing and simpering.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are a first-rate shot with a rifle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Pause, during which Gwendolen, having taken a rapid observation of
      Grandcourt, made a brief graphic description of him to an indefinite
      hearer.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have left off shooting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, you are a formidable person. People who have done things
      once and left them off make one feel very contemptible, as if one were
      using cast-off fashions. I hope you have not left off all follies, because
      I practice a great many.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Pause, during which Gwendolen made several interpretations of her own
      speech.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you call follies?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in general, I think, whatever is agreeable is called a folly.
      But you have not left off hunting, I hear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Pause, wherein Gwendolen recalled what she had heard about Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      position, and decided that he was the most aristocratic-looking man she
      had ever seen.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must do something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you care about the turf?&mdash;or is that among the things
      you have left off?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Pause, during which Gwendolen thought that a man of extremely calm, cold
      manners might be less disagreeable as a husband than other men, and not
      likely to interfere with his wife&rsquo;s preferences.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I run a horse now and then; but I don&rsquo;t go in for the thing
      as some men do. Are you fond of horses?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed; I never like my life so well as when I am on
      horseback, having a great gallop. I think of nothing. I only feel myself
      strong and happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Pause, wherein Gwendolen wondered whether Grandcourt would like what she
      said, but assured herself that she was not going to disguise her tastes.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like danger?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. When I am on horseback I never think of danger.
      It seems to me that if I broke my bones I should not feel it. I should go
      at anything that came in my way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Pause during which Gwendolen had run through a whole hunting season with
      two chosen hunters to ride at will.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would perhaps like tiger-hunting or pig-sticking. I saw some of
      that for a season or two in the East. Everything here is poor stuff after
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> are fond of danger, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Pause, wherein Gwendolen speculated on the probability that the men of
      coldest manners were the most adventurous, and felt the strength of her
      own insight, supposing the question had to be decided.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must have something or other. But one gets used to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to think I am very fortunate, because everything is new to
      me: it is only that I can&rsquo;t get enough of it. I am not used to
      anything except being dull, which I should like to leave off as you have
      left off shooting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Pause, during which it occurred to Gwendolen that a man of cold and
      distinguished manners might possibly be a dull companion; but on the other
      hand she thought that most persons were dull, that she had not observed
      husbands to be companions&mdash;and that after all she was not going to
      accept Grandcourt.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you dull?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a dreadful neighborhood. There is nothing to be done in it.
      That is why I practiced my archery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Pause, during which Gwendolen reflected that the life of an unmarried
      woman who could not go about and had no command of anything must
      necessarily be dull through all degrees of comparison as time went on.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made yourself queen of it. I imagine you will carry the
      first prize.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. I have great rivals. Did you not observe
      how well Miss Arrowpoint shot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Pause, wherein Gwendolen was thinking that men had been known to choose
      some one else than the woman they most admired, and recalled several
      experiences of that kind in novels.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Arrowpoint. No&mdash;that is, yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go now and hear what the scoring says? Every one is going
      to the other end now&mdash;shall we join them? I think my uncle is looking
      toward me. He perhaps wants me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen found a relief for herself by thus changing the situation: not
      that the <i>tete-à-tete</i> was quite disagreeable to her; but while it
      lasted she apparently could not get rid of the unwonted flush in her
      cheeks and the sense of surprise which made her feel less mistress of
      herself than usual. And this Mr. Grandcourt, who seemed to feel his own
      importance more than he did hers&mdash;a sort of unreasonableness few of
      us can tolerate&mdash;must not take for granted that he was of great
      moment to her, or that because others speculated on him as a desirable
      match she held herself altogether at his beck. How Grandcourt had filled
      up the pauses will be more evident hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have just missed the gold arrow, Gwendolen,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Gascoigne. &ldquo;Miss Juliet Fenn scores eight above you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to hear it. I should have felt that I was making
      myself too disagreeable&mdash;taking the best of everything,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, quite easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to be jealous of Juliet Fenn, a girl as middling as
      mid-day market in everything but her archery and plainness, in which last
      she was noticeable like her father: underhung and with receding brow
      resembling that of the more intelligent fishes. (Surely, considering the
      importance which is given to such an accident in female offspring,
      marriageable men, or what the new English calls &ldquo;intending
      bridegrooms,&rdquo; should look at themselves dispassionately in the
      glass, since their natural selection of a mate prettier than themselves is
      not certain to bar the effect of their own ugliness.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There was now a lively movement in the mingling groups, which carried the
      talk along with it. Every one spoke to every one else by turns, and
      Gwendolen, who chose to see what was going on around her now, observed
      that Grandcourt was having Klesmer presented to him by some one unknown to
      her&mdash;a middle-aged man, with dark, full face and fat hands, who
      seemed to be on the easiest terms with both, and presently led the way in
      joining the Arrowpoints, whose acquaintance had already been made by both
      him and Grandcourt. Who this stranger was she did not care much to know;
      but she wished to observe what was Grandcourt&rsquo;s manner toward others
      than herself. Precisely the same: except that he did not look much at Miss
      Arrowpoint, but rather at Klesmer, who was speaking with animation&mdash;now
      stretching out his long fingers horizontally, now pointing downward with
      his fore-finger, now folding his arms and tossing his mane, while he
      addressed himself first to one and then to the other, including
      Grandcourt, who listened with an impassive face and narrow eyes, his left
      fore-finger in his waistcoat-pocket, and his right slightly touching his
      thin whisker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder which style Miss Arrowpoint admires most,&rdquo; was a
      thought that glanced through Gwendolen&rsquo;s mind, while her eyes and
      lips gathered rather a mocking expression. But she would not indulge her
      sense of amusement by watching, as if she were curious, and she gave all
      her animation to those immediately around her, determined not to care
      whether Mr. Grandcourt came near her again or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did come, however, and at a moment when he could propose to conduct
      Mrs. Davilow to her carriage, &ldquo;Shall we meet again in the ball-room?&rdquo;
      she said as he raised his hat at parting. The &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in reply
      had the usual slight drawl and perfect gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were wrong for once, Gwendolen,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow,
      during their few minutes&rsquo; drive to the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what, mamma?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Mr. Grandcourt&rsquo;s appearance and manners. You can&rsquo;t
      find anything ridiculous in him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I could if I tried, but I don&rsquo;t want to do it,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, rather pettishly; and her mother was afraid to say more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the rule on these occasions for the ladies and gentlemen to dine
      apart, so that the dinner might make a time of comparative ease and rest
      for both. Indeed, the gentlemen had a set of archery stories about the
      epicurism of the ladies, who had somehow been reported to show a revolting
      masculine judgment in venison, even asking for the fat&mdash;a proof of
      the frightful rate at which corruption might go on in women, but for
      severe social restraint, and every year the amiable Lord Brackenshaw, who
      was something of a <i>gourmet</i>, mentioned Byron&rsquo;s opinion that a
      woman should never be seen eating,&mdash;introducing it with a
      confidential&mdash;&ldquo;The fact is&rdquo; as if he were for the first
      time admitting his concurrence in that sentiment of the refined poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the ladies&rsquo; dining-room it was evident that Gwendolen was not a
      general favorite with her own sex: there were no beginnings of intimacy
      between her and other girls, and in conversation they rather noticed what
      she said than spoke to her in free exchange. Perhaps it was that she was
      not much interested in them, and when left alone in their company had a
      sense of empty benches. Mrs. Vulcany once remarked that Miss Harleth was
      too fond of the gentlemen; but we know that she was not in the least fond
      of them&mdash;she was only fond of their homage&mdash;and women did not
      give her homage. The exception to this willing aloofness from her was Miss
      Arrowpoint, who often managed unostentatiously to be by her side, and
      talked to her with quiet friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows, as I do, that our friends are ready to quarrel over a
      husband for us,&rdquo; thought Gwendolen, &ldquo;and she is determined not
      to enter into the quarrel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Miss Arrowpoint has the best manners I ever saw,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Davilow, when she and Gwendolen were in a dressing-room with
      Mrs. Gascoigne and Anna, but at a distance where they could have their
      talk apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were like her,&rdquo; said Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Are you getting discontented with yourself, Gwen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I am discontented with things. She seems contented.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you ought to be satisfied to-day. You must have enjoyed
      the shooting. I saw you did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is over now, and I don&rsquo;t know what will come next,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, stretching herself with a sort of moan and throwing up her
      arms. They were bare now; it was the fashion to dance in the archery
      dress, throwing off the jacket; and the simplicity of her white cashmere
      with its border of pale green set off her form to the utmost. A thin line
      of gold round her neck, and the gold star on her breast, were her only
      ornaments. Her smooth soft hair piled up into a grand crown made a clear
      line about her brow. Sir Joshua would have been glad to take her portrait;
      and he would have had an easier task than the historian at least in this,
      that he would not have had to represent the truth of change&mdash;only to
      give stability to one beautiful moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dancing will come next,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow &ldquo;You are
      sure to enjoy that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall only dance in the quadrille. I told Mr. Clintock so. I
      shall not waltz or polk with any one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why in the world do you say that all on a sudden?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear having ugly people so near me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom do you mean by ugly people?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, plenty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Clintock, for example, is not ugly.&rdquo; Mrs. Davilow dared
      not mention Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hate woolen cloth touching me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy!&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow to her sister who now came up from
      the other end of the room. &ldquo;Gwendolen says she will not waltz or
      polk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is rather given to whims, I think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gascoigne,
      gravely. &ldquo;It would be more becoming in her to behave as other young
      ladies do on such an occasion as this; especially when she has had the
      advantage of first-rate dancing lessons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I dance if I don&rsquo;t like it, aunt? It is not in the
      catechism.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My <i>dear</i>!&rdquo; said Mrs. Gascoigne, in a tone of severe
      check, and Anna looked frightened at Gwendolen&rsquo;s daring. But they
      all passed on without saying any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently something had changed Gwendolen&rsquo;s mood since the hour of
      exulting enjoyment in the archery-ground. But she did not look the worse
      under the chandeliers in the ball-room, where the soft splendor of the
      scene and the pleasant odors from the conservatory could not but be
      soothing to the temper, when accompanied with the consciousness of being
      preeminently sought for. Hardly a dancing man but was anxious to have her
      for a partner, and each whom she accepted was in a state of melancholy
      remonstrance that she would not waltz or polk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you under a vow, Miss Harleth?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Why are you
      so cruel to us all?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You waltzed with me in February.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And
      you who waltz so perfectly!&rdquo; were exclamations not without piquancy
      for her. The ladies who waltzed naturally thought that Miss Harleth only
      wanted to make herself particular; but her uncle when he overheard her
      refusal, supported her by saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gwendolen has usually good reasons.&rdquo; He thought she was
      certainly more distinguished in not waltzing, and he wished her to be
      distinguished. The archery ball was intended to be kept at the subdued
      pitch that suited all dignities clerical and secular; it was not an
      escapement for youthful high spirits, and he himself was of opinion that
      the fashionable dances were too much of a romp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the remonstrant dancing men, however, Mr. Grandcourt was not
      numbered. After standing up for a quadrille with Miss Arrowpoint, it
      seemed that he meant to ask for no other partner. Gwendolen observed him
      frequently with the Arrowpoints, but he never took an opportunity of
      approaching her. Mr. Gascoigne was sometimes speaking to him; but Mr.
      Gascoigne was everywhere. It was in her mind now that she would probably
      after all not have the least trouble about him: perhaps he had looked at
      her without any particular admiration, and was too much used to everything
      in the world to think of her as more than one of the girls who were
      invited in that part of the country. Of course! It was ridiculous of
      elders to entertain notions about what a man would do, without having seen
      him even through a telescope. Probably he meant to marry Miss Arrowpoint.
      Whatever might come, she, Gwendolen, was not going to be disappointed: the
      affair was a joke whichever way it turned, for she had never committed
      herself even by a silent confidence in anything Mr. Grandcourt would do.
      Still, she noticed that he did sometimes quietly and gradually change his
      position according to hers, so that he could see her whenever she was
      dancing, and if he did not admire her&mdash;so much the worse for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This movement for the sake of being in sight of her was more direct than
      usual rather late in the evening, when Gwendolen had accepted Klesmer as a
      partner; and that wide-glancing personage, who saw everything and nothing
      by turns, said to her when they were walking, &ldquo;Mr. Grandcourt is a
      man of taste. He likes to see you dancing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he likes to look at what is against his taste,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, with a light laugh; she was quite courageous with Klesmer now.
      &ldquo;He may be so tired of admiring that he likes disgust for variety.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those words are not suitable to your lips,&rdquo; said Klesmer,
      quickly, with one of his grand frowns, while he shook his hand as if to
      banish the discordant sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you as critical of words as of music?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I am. I should require your words to be what your face
      and form are&mdash;always among the meanings of a noble music.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a compliment as well as a correction. I am obliged for
      both. But do you know I am bold enough to wish to correct <i>you</i>, and
      require you to understand a joke?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One may understand jokes without liking them,&rdquo; said the
      terrible Klesmer. &ldquo;I have had opera books sent me full of jokes; it
      was just because I understood them that I did not like them. The comic
      people are ready to challenge a man because he looks grave. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t
      see the witticism, sir?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, sir, but I see what you meant.&rsquo;
      Then I am what we call ticketed as a fellow without <i>esprit</i>. But, in
      fact,&rdquo; said Klesmer, suddenly dropping from his quick narrative to a
      reflective tone, with an impressive frown, &ldquo;I am very sensible to
      wit and humor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you tell me that,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, not without some
      wickedness of intention. But Klesmer&rsquo;s thoughts had flown off on the
      wings of his own statement, as their habit was, and she had the wickedness
      all to herself. &ldquo;Pray, who is that standing near the card-room door?&rdquo;
      she went on, seeing there the same stranger with whom Klesmer had been in
      animated talk on the archery ground. &ldquo;He is a friend of yours, I
      think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; an amateur I have seen in town; Lush, a Mr. Lush&mdash;too
      fond of Meyerbeer and Scribe&mdash;too fond of the mechanical-dramatic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. I wanted to know whether you thought his face and form
      required that his words should be among the meanings of noble music?&rdquo;
      Klesmer was conquered, and flashed at her a delightful smile which made
      them quite friendly until she begged to be deposited by the side of her
      mamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three minutes afterward her preparations for Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      indifference were all canceled. Turning her head after some remark to her
      mother, she found that he had made his way up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask if you are tired of dancing, Miss Harleth?&rdquo; he
      began, looking down with his former unperturbed expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you do me the honor&mdash;the next&mdash;or another quadrille?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have been very happy,&rdquo; said Gwendolen looking at her
      card, &ldquo;but I am engaged for the next to Mr. Clintock&mdash;and
      indeed I perceive that I am doomed for every quadrille; I have not one to
      dispose of.&rdquo; She was not sorry to punish Mr. Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      tardiness, yet at the same time she would have liked to dance with him.
      She gave him a charming smile as she looked up to deliver her answer, and
      he stood still looking down at her with no smile at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am unfortunate in being too late,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed to me that you did not care for dancing,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen. &ldquo;I thought it might be one of the things you had left
      off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I have not begun to dance with you,&rdquo; said
      Grandcourt. Always there was the same pause before he took up his cue.
      &ldquo;You make dancing a new thing, as you make archery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is novelty always agreeable?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;not always.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t know whether to feel flattered or not. When you
      had once danced with me there would be no more novelty in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, there would probably be much more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is deep. I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is difficult to make Miss Harleth understand her power?&rdquo;
      Here Grandcourt had turned to Mrs. Davilow, who, smiling gently at her
      daughter, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she does not generally strike people as slow to understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, in a deprecating tone, &ldquo;I am
      adorably stupid, and want everything explained to me&mdash;when the
      meaning is pleasant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are stupid, I admit that stupidity is adorable,&rdquo;
      returned Grandcourt, after the usual pause, and without change of tone.
      But clearly he knew what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to think that my cavalier has forgotten me,&rdquo;
      Gwendolen observed after a little while. &ldquo;I see the quadrille is
      being formed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He deserves to be renounced,&rdquo; said Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he is very pardonable,&rdquo; said Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must have been some misunderstanding,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow. &ldquo;Mr. Clintock was too anxious about the engagement to have
      forgotten it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But now Lady Brackenshaw came up and said, &ldquo;Miss Harleth, Mr.
      Clintock has charged me to express to you his deep regret that he was
      obliged to leave without having the pleasure of dancing with you again. An
      express came from his father, the archdeacon; something important; he was
      to go. He was <i>au désespoir</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he was very good to remember the engagement under the
      circumstances,&rdquo; said Gwendolen. &ldquo;I am sorry he was called
      away.&rdquo; It was easy to be politely sorrowful on so felicitous an
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can profit by Mr. Clintock&rsquo;s misfortune?&rdquo; said
      Grandcourt. &ldquo;May I hope that you will let me take his place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very happy to dance the next quadrille with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The appropriateness of the event seemed an augury, and as Gwendolen stood
      up for the quadrille with Grandcourt, there was a revival in her of the
      exultation&mdash;the sense of carrying everything before her, which she
      had felt earlier in the day. No man could have walked through the
      quadrille with more irreproachable ease than Grandcourt; and the absence
      of all eagerness in his attention to her suited his partner&rsquo;s taste.
      She was now convinced that he meant to distinguish her, to mark his
      admiration of her in a noticeable way; and it began to appear probable
      that she would have it in her power to reject him, whence there was a
      pleasure in reckoning up the advantages which would make her rejection
      splendid, and in giving Mr. Grandcourt his utmost value. It was also
      agreeable to divine that this exclusive selection of her to dance with,
      from among all the unmarried ladies present, would attract observation;
      though she studiously avoided seeing this, and at the end of the quadrille
      walked away on Grandcourt&rsquo;s arm as if she had been one of the
      shortest sighted instead of the longest and widest sighted of mortals.
      They encountered Miss Arrowpoint, who was standing with Lady Brackenshaw
      and a group of gentlemen. The heiress looked at Gwendolen invitingly and
      said, &ldquo;I hope you will vote with us, Miss Harleth, and Mr.
      Grandcourt too, though he is not an archer.&rdquo; Gwendolen and
      Grandcourt paused to join the group, and found that the voting turned on
      the project of a picnic archery meeting to be held in Cardell Chase, where
      the evening entertainment would be more poetic than a ball under
      chandeliers&mdash;a feast of sunset lights along the glades and through
      the branches and over the solemn tree-tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen thought the scheme delightful&mdash;equal to playing Robin Hood
      and Maid Marian: and Mr. Grandcourt, when appealed to a second time, said
      it was a thing to be done; whereupon Mr. Lush, who stood behind Lady
      Brackenshaw&rsquo;s elbow, drew Gwendolen&rsquo;s notice by saying with a
      familiar look and tone to Grandcourt, &ldquo;Diplow would be a good place
      for the meeting, and more convenient: there&rsquo;s a fine bit between the
      oaks toward the north gate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Impossible to look more unconscious of being addressed than Grandcourt;
      but Gwendolen took a new survey of the speaker, deciding, first, that he
      must be on terms of intimacy with the tenant of Diplow, and, secondly,
      that she would never, if she could help it, let him come within a yard of
      her. She was subject to physical antipathies, and Mr. Lush&rsquo;s
      prominent eyes, fat though not clumsy figure, and strong black
      gray-besprinkled hair of frizzy thickness, which, with the rest of his
      prosperous person, was enviable to many, created one of the strongest of
      her antipathies. To be safe from his looking at her, she murmured to
      Grandcourt, &ldquo;I should like to continue walking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed immediately; but when they were thus away from any audience, he
      spoke no word for several minutes, and she, out of a half-amused,
      half-serious inclination for experiment, would not speak first. They
      turned into the large conservatory, beautifully lit up with Chinese lamps.
      The other couples there were at a distance which would not have interfered
      with any dialogue, but still they walked in silence until they had reached
      the farther end where there was a flush of pink light, and the second wide
      opening into the ball-room. Grandcourt, when they had half turned round,
      paused and said languidly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like this kind of thing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If the situation had been described to Gwendolen half an hour before, she
      would have laughed heartily at it, and could only have imagined herself
      returning a playful, satirical answer. But for some mysterious reason&mdash;it
      was a mystery of which she had a faint wondering consciousness&mdash;she
      dared not be satirical: she had begun to feel a wand over her that made
      her afraid of offending Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, quietly, without considering what &ldquo;kind
      of thing&rdquo; was meant&mdash;whether the flowers, the scents, the ball
      in general, or this episode of walking with Mr. Grandcourt in particular.
      And they returned along the conservatory without farther interpretation.
      She then proposed to go and sit down in her old place, and they walked
      among scattered couples preparing for the waltz to the spot where Mrs.
      Davilow had been seated all the evening. As they approached it her seat
      was vacant, but she was coming toward it again, and, to Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      shuddering annoyance, with Mr. Lush at her elbow. There was no avoiding
      the confrontation: her mamma came close to her before they had reached the
      seats, and, after a quiet greeting smile, said innocently, &ldquo;Gwendolen,
      dear, let me present Mr. Lush to you.&rdquo; Having just made the
      acquaintance of this personage, as an intimate and constant companion of
      Mr. Grandcourt&rsquo;s, Mrs. Davilow imagined it altogether desirable that
      her daughter also should make the acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hardly a bow that Gwendolen gave&mdash;rather, it was the slightest
      forward sweep of the head away from the physiognomy that inclined itself
      toward her, and she immediately moved toward her seat, saying, &ldquo;I
      want to put on my burnous.&rdquo; No sooner had she reached it, than Mr.
      Lush was there, and had the burnous in his hand: to annoy this
      supercilious young lady, he would incur the offense of forestalling
      Grandcourt; and, holding up the garment close to Gwendolen, he said,
      &ldquo;Pray, permit me?&rdquo; But she, wheeling away from him as if he
      had been a muddy hound, glided on to the ottoman, saying, &ldquo;No, thank
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A man who forgave this would have much Christian feeling, supposing he had
      intended to be agreeable to the young lady; but before he seized the
      burnous Mr. Lush had ceased to have that intention. Grandcourt quietly
      took the drapery from him, and Mr. Lush, with a slight bow, moved away.
      &ldquo;You had perhaps better put it on,&rdquo; said Mr. Grandcourt,
      looking down on her without change of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks; perhaps it would be wise,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, rising,
      and submitting very gracefully to take the burnous on her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Mr. Grandcourt exchanged a few polite speeches with Mrs.
      Davilow, and, in taking leave, asked permission to call at Offendene the
      next day. He was evidently not offended by the insult directed toward his
      friend. Certainly Gwendolen&rsquo;s refusal of the burnous from Mr. Lush
      was open to the interpretation that she wished to receive it from Mr.
      Grandcourt. But she, poor child, had no design in this action, and was
      simply following her antipathy and inclination, confiding in them as she
      did in the more reflective judgments into which they entered as sap into
      leafage. Gwendolen had no sense that these men were dark enigmas to her,
      or that she needed any help in drawing conclusions about them&mdash;Mr.
      Grandcourt at least. The chief question was, how far his character and
      ways might answer her wishes; and unless she were satisfied about that,
      she had said to herself that she would not accept his offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could there be a slenderer, more insignificant thread in human history
      than this consciousness of a girl, busy with her small inferences of the
      way in which she could make her life pleasant?&mdash;in a time, too, when
      ideas were with fresh vigor making armies of themselves, and the universal
      kinship was declaring itself fiercely; when women on the other side of the
      world would not mourn for the husbands and sons who died bravely in a
      common cause, and men stinted of bread on our side of the world heard of
      that willing loss and were patient: a time when the soul of man was
      walking to pulses which had for centuries been beating in him unfelt,
      until their full sum made a new life of terror or of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      What in the midst of that mighty drama are girls and their blind visions?
      They are the Yea or Nay of that good for which men are enduring and
      fighting. In these delicate vessels is borne onward through the ages the
      treasure of human affections.

      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O gentlemen, the time of life is short;
  To spend that shortness basely were too long,
  If life did ride upon a dial&rsquo;s point,
  Still ending at the arrival of an hour.&rdquo;
                 &mdash;SHAKESPEARE: <i>Henry IV</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      On the second day after the archery meeting, Mr. Henleigh Mallinger
      Grandcourt was at his breakfast-table with Mr. Lush. Everything around
      them was agreeable: the summer air through the open windows, at which the
      dogs could walk in from the old green turf on the lawn; the soft, purplish
      coloring of the park beyond, stretching toward a mass of bordering wood;
      the still life in the room, which seemed the stiller for its sober
      antiquated elegance, as if it kept a conscious, well-bred silence, unlike
      the restlessness of vulgar furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the gentlemen were agreeable to each other was less evident. Mr.
      Grandcourt had drawn his chair aside so as to face the lawn, and with his
      left leg over another chair, and his right elbow on the table, was smoking
      a large cigar, while his companion was still eating. The dogs&mdash;half-a-dozen
      of various kinds were moving lazily in and out, taking attitudes of brief
      attention&mdash;gave a vacillating preference first to one gentleman, then
      to the other; being dogs in such good circumstances that they could play
      at hunger, and liked to be served with delicacies which they declined to
      put in their mouths; all except Fetch, the beautiful liver-colored
      water-spaniel, which sat with its forepaws firmly planted and its
      expressive brown face turned upward, watching Grandcourt with unshaken
      constancy. He held in his lap a tiny Maltese dog with a tiny silver collar
      and bell, and when he had a hand unused by cigar or coffee-cup, it rested
      on this small parcel of animal warmth. I fear that Fetch was jealous, and
      wounded that her master gave her no word or look; at last it seemed that
      she could bear this neglect no longer, and she gently put her large silky
      paw on her master&rsquo;s leg. Grandcourt looked at her with unchanged
      face for half a minute, and then took the trouble to lay down his cigar
      while he lifted the unimpassioned Fluff close to his chin and gave it
      caressing pats, all the while gravely watching Fetch, who, poor thing,
      whimpered interruptedly, as if trying to repress that sign of discontent,
      and at last rested her head beside the appealing paw, looking up with
      piteous beseeching. So, at least, a lover of dogs must have interpreted
      Fetch, and Grandcourt kept so many dogs that he was reputed to love them;
      at any rate, his impulse to act just in that way started from such an
      interpretation. But when the amusing anguish burst forth in a howling
      bark, Grandcourt pushed Fetch down without speaking, and, depositing Fluff
      carelessly on the table (where his black nose predominated over a
      salt-cellar), began to look to his cigar, and found, with some annoyance
      against Fetch as the cause, that the brute of a cigar required relighting.
      Fetch, having begun to wail, found, like others of her sex, that it was
      not easy to leave off; indeed, the second howl was a louder one, and the
      third was like unto it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn out that brute, will you?&rdquo; said Grandcourt to Lush,
      without raising his voice or looking at him&mdash;as if he counted on
      attention to the smallest sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lush immediately rose, lifted Fetch, though she was rather heavy, and
      he was not fond of stooping, and carried her out, disposing of her in some
      way that took him a couple of minutes before he returned. He then lit a
      cigar, placed himself at an angle where he could see Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      face without turning, and presently said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you ride or drive to Quetcham to-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to Quetcham.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not go yesterday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt smoked in silence for half a minute, and then said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you sent my card and inquiries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went myself at four, and said you were sure to be there shortly.
      They would suppose some accident prevented you from fulfilling the
      intention. Especially if you go to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence for a couple of minutes. Then Grandcourt said, &ldquo;What men are
      invited here with their wives?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lush drew out a note-book. &ldquo;The Captain and Mrs. Torrington come
      next week. Then there are Mr. Hollis and Lady Flora, and the Cushats and
      the Gogoffs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a ragged lot,&rdquo; remarked Grandcourt, after a while.
      &ldquo;Why did you ask the Gogoffs? When you write invitations in my name,
      be good enough to give me a list, instead of bringing down a giantess on
      me without my knowledge. She spoils the look of the room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You invited the Gogoffs yourself when you met them in Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has my meeting them in Paris to do with it? I told you to give
      me a list.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt, like many others, had two remarkably different voices.
      Hitherto we have heard him speaking in a superficial interrupted drawl
      suggestive chiefly of languor and <i>ennui</i>. But this last brief speech
      was uttered in subdued inward, yet distinct, tones, which Lush had long
      been used to recognize as the expression of a peremptory will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any other couples you would like to invite?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; think of some decent people, with a daughter or two. And one
      of your damned musicians. But not a comic fellow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if Klesmer would consent to come to us when he leaves
      Quetcham. Nothing but first-class music will go down with Miss Arrowpoint.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lush spoke carelessly, but he was really seizing an opportunity and fixing
      an observant look on Grandcourt, who now for the first time, turned his
      eyes toward his companion, but slowly and without speaking until he had
      given two long luxuriant puffs, when he said, perhaps in a lower tone than
      ever, but with a perceptible edge of contempt,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the name of nonsense have I to do with Miss Arrowpoint and
      her music?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, something,&rdquo; said Lush, jocosely. &ldquo;You need not
      give yourself much trouble, perhaps. But some forms must be gone through
      before a man can marry a million.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. But I am not going to marry a million.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity&mdash;to fling away an opportunity of this
      sort, and knock down your own plans.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Your</i> plans, I suppose you mean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some debts, you know, and things may turn out
      inconveniently, after all. The heirship is not <i>absolutely</i> certain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt did not answer, and Lush went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It really is a fine opportunity. The father and mother ask for
      nothing better, I can see, and the daughter&rsquo;s looks and manners
      require no allowances, any more than if she hadn&rsquo;t a sixpence. She
      is not beautiful; but equal to carrying any rank. And she is not likely to
      refuse such prospects as you can offer her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The father and mother would let you do anything you like with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should not like to do anything with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it was Lush who made a little pause before speaking again, and then
      he said in a deep voice of remonstrance, &ldquo;Good God, Grandcourt!
      after your experience, will you let a whim interfere with your comfortable
      settlement in life?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare your oratory. I know what I am going to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Lush put down his cigar and thrust his hands into his
      side pockets, as if he had to face something exasperating, but meant to
      keep his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to marry the other girl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you fallen in love?&rdquo; This question carried a strong
      sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to marry her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made her an offer already, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a young lady with a will of her own, I fancy. Extremely well
      fitted to make a rumpus. She would know what she liked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t like you,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, with the ghost
      of a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly true,&rdquo; said Lush, adding again in a markedly
      sneering tone. &ldquo;However, if you and she are devoted to each other,
      that will be enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt took no notice of this speech, but sipped his coffee, rose, and
      strolled out on the lawn, all the dogs following him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lush glanced after him a moment, then resumed his cigar and lit it, but
      smoked slowly, consulting his beard with inspecting eyes and fingers, till
      he finally stroked it with an air of having arrived at some conclusion,
      and said in a subdued voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Check, old boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lush, being a man of some ability, had not known Grandcourt for fifteen
      years without learning what sort of measures were useless with him, though
      what sort might be useful remained often dubious. In the beginning of his
      career he held a fellowship, and was near taking orders for the sake of a
      college living, but, not being fond of that prospect, accepted instead the
      office of traveling companion to a marquess, and afterward to young
      Grandcourt, who had lost his father early, and who found Lush so
      convenient that he had allowed him to become prime minister in all his
      more personal affairs. The habit of fifteen years had made Grandcourt more
      and more in need of Lush&rsquo;s handiness, and Lush more and more in need
      of the lazy luxury to which his transactions on behalf of Grandcourt made
      no interruption worth reckoning. I cannot say that the same lengthened
      habit had intensified Grandcourt&rsquo;s want of respect for his companion
      since that want had been absolute from the beginning, but it had confirmed
      his sense that he might kick Lush if he chose&mdash;only he never did
      choose to kick any animal, because the act of kicking is a compromising
      attitude, and a gentleman&rsquo;s dogs should be kicked for him. He only
      said things which might have exposed himself to be kicked if his confidant
      had been a man of independent spirit. But what son of a vicar who has
      stinted his wife and daughters of calico in order to send his male
      offspring to Oxford, can keep an independent spirit when he is bent on
      dining with high discrimination, riding good horses, living generally in
      the most luxuriant honey-blossomed clover&mdash;and all without working?
      Mr. Lush had passed for a scholar once, and had still a sense of
      scholarship when he was not trying to remember much of it; but the
      bachelor&rsquo;s and other arts which soften manners are a time-honored
      preparation for sinecures; and Lush&rsquo;s present comfortable provision
      was as good a sinecure in not requiring more than the odor of departed
      learning. He was not unconscious of being held kickable, but he preferred
      counting that estimate among the peculiarities of Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      character, which made one of his incalculable moods or judgments as good
      as another. Since in his own opinion he had never done a bad action, it
      did not seem necessary to consider whether he should be likely to commit
      one if his love of ease required it. Lush&rsquo;s love of ease was
      well-satisfied at present, and if his puddings were rolled toward him in
      the dust, he took the inside bits and found them relishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning, for example, though he had encountered more annoyance than
      usual, he went to his private sitting-room and played a good hour on the
      violoncello.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Philistia, be thou glad of me!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Grandcourt having made up his mind to marry Miss Harleth, showed a power
      of adapting means to ends. During the next fortnight there was hardly a
      day on which by some arrangement or other he did not see her, or prove by
      emphatic attentions that she occupied his thoughts. His cousin, Mrs.
      Torrington, was now doing the honors of his house, so that Mrs. Davilow
      and Gwendolen could be invited to a large party at Diplow in which there
      were many witnesses how the host distinguished the dowerless beauty, and
      showed no solicitude about the heiress. The world&mdash;I mean Mr.
      Gascoigne and all the families worth speaking of within visiting distance
      of Pennicote&mdash;felt an assurance on the subject which in the rector&rsquo;s
      mind converted itself into a resolution to do his duty by his niece and
      see that the settlements were adequate. Indeed the wonder to him and Mrs.
      Davilow was that the offer for which so many suitable occasions presented
      themselves had not been already made; and in this wonder Grandcourt
      himself was not without a share. When he had told his resolution to Lush
      he had thought that the affair would be concluded more quickly, and to his
      own surprise he had repeatedly promised himself in a morning that he would
      to-day give Gwendolen the opportunity of accepting him, and had found in
      the evening that the necessary formality was still unaccomplished. This
      remarkable fact served to heighten his determination on another day. He
      had never admitted to himself that Gwendolen might refuse him, but&mdash;heaven
      help us all!&mdash;we are often unable to act on our certainties; our
      objection to a contrary issue (were it possible) is so strong that it
      rises like a spectral illusion between us and our certainty; we are
      rationally sure that the blind worm can not bite us mortally, but it would
      be so intolerable to be bitten, and the creature has a biting look&mdash;we
      decline to handle it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had asked leave to have a beautiful horse of his brought for Gwendolen
      to ride. Mrs. Davilow was to accompany her in the carriage, and they were
      to go to Diplow to lunch, Grandcourt conducting them. It was a fine
      mid-harvest time, not too warm for a noonday ride of five miles to be
      delightful; the poppies glowed on the borders of the fields, there was
      enough breeze to move gently like a social spirit among the ears of uncut
      corn, and to wing the shadow of a cloud across the soft gray downs; here
      the sheaves were standing, there the horses were straining their muscles
      under the last load from a wide space of stubble, but everywhere the green
      pasture made a broader setting for the corn-fields, and the cattle took
      their rest under wide branches. The road lay through a bit of country
      where the dairy-farms looked much as they did in the days of our
      forefathers&mdash;where peace and permanence seemed to find a home away
      from the busy change that sent the railway train flying in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the spirit of peace and permanence did not penetrate poor Mrs. Davilow&rsquo;s
      mind so as to overcome her habit of uneasy foreboding. Gwendolen and
      Grandcourt cantering in front of her, and then slackening their pace to a
      conversational walk till the carriage came up with them again, made a
      gratifying sight; but it served chiefly to keep up the conflict of hopes
      and fears about her daughter&rsquo;s lot. Here was an irresistible
      opportunity for a lover to speak and put an end to all uncertainties, and
      Mrs. Davilow could only hope with trembling that Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      decision would be favorable. Certainly if Rex&rsquo;s love had been
      repugnant to her, Mr. Grandcourt had the advantage of being in complete
      contrast with Rex; and that he had produced some quite novel impression on
      her seemed evident in her marked abstinence from satirical observations,
      nay, her total silence about his characteristics, a silence which Mrs.
      Davilow did not dare to break. &ldquo;Is he a man she would be happy with?&rdquo;&mdash;was
      a question that inevitably arose in the mother&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;Well,
      perhaps as happy as she would be with any one else&mdash;or as most other
      women are&rdquo;&mdash;was the answer with which she tried to quiet
      herself; for she could not imagine Gwendolen under the influence of any
      feeling which would make her satisfied in what we traditionally call
      &ldquo;mean circumstances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s own thought was looking in the same direction: he
      wanted to have done with the uncertainty that belonged to his not having
      spoken. As to any further uncertainty&mdash;well, it was something without
      any reasonable basis, some quality in the air which acted as an irritant
      to his wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen enjoyed the riding, but her pleasure did not break forth in
      girlish unpremeditated chat and laughter as it did on that morning with
      Rex. She spoke a little, and even laughed, but with a lightness as of a
      far-off echo: for her too there was some peculiar quality in the air&mdash;not,
      she was sure, any subjugation of her will by Mr. Grandcourt, and the
      splendid prospects he meant to offer her; for Gwendolen desired every one,
      that dignified gentleman himself included, to understand that she was
      going to do just as she liked, and that they had better not calculate on
      her pleasing them. If she chose to take this husband, she would have him
      know that she was not going to renounce her freedom, or according to her
      favorite formula, &ldquo;not going to do as other women did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s speeches this morning were, as usual, all of that brief
      sort which never fails to make a conversational figure when the speaker is
      held important in his circle. Stopping so soon, they give signs of a
      suppressed and formidable ability so say more, and have also the
      meritorious quality of allowing lengthiness to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like Criterion&rsquo;s paces?&rdquo; he said, after they
      had entered the park and were slacking from a canter to a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is delightful to ride. I should like to have a leap with him, if
      it would not frighten mamma. There was a good wide channel we passed five
      minutes ago. I should like to have a gallop back and take it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do. We can take it together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks. Mamma is so timid&mdash;if she saw me it might make her
      ill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go and explain. Criterion would take it without fail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;indeed&mdash;you are very kind&mdash;but it would alarm
      her too much. I dare take any leap when she is not by; but I do it and don&rsquo;t
      tell her about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can let the carriage pass and then set off.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, pray don&rsquo;t think of it any more: I spoke quite
      randomly,&rdquo; said Gwendolen; she began to feel a new objection to
      carrying out her own proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mrs. Davilow knows I shall take care of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but she would think of you as having to take care of my broken
      neck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a considerable pause before Grandcourt said, looking toward her,
      &ldquo;I should like to have the right always to take care of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen did not turn her eyes on him; it seemed to her a long while that
      she was first blushing, and then turning pale, but to Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      rate of judgment she answered soon enough, with the lightest flute-tone
      and a careless movement of the head, &ldquo;Oh, I am not sure that I want
      to be taken care of: if I chose to risk breaking my neck, I should like to
      be at liberty to do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She checked her horse as she spoke, and turned in her saddle, looking
      toward the advancing carriage. Her eyes swept across Grandcourt as she
      made this movement, but there was no language in them to correct the
      carelessness of her reply. At that very moment she was aware that she was
      risking something&mdash;not her neck, but the possibility of finally
      checking Grandcourt&rsquo;s advances, and she did not feel contented with
      the possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn her!&rdquo; thought Grandcourt, as he too checked his horse.
      He was not a wordy thinker, and this explosive phrase stood for mixed
      impressions which eloquent interpreters might have expanded into some
      sentences full of an irritated sense that he was being mystified, and a
      determination that this girl should not make a fool of him. Did she want
      him to throw himself at her feet and declare that he was dying for her? It
      was not by that gate that she could enter on the privileges he could give
      her. Or did she expect him to write his proposals? Equally a delusion. He
      would not make his offer in any way that could place him definitely in the
      position of being rejected. But as to her accepting him, she had done it
      already in accepting his marked attentions: and anything which happened to
      break them off would be understood to her disadvantage. She was merely
      coquetting, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the carriage came up, and no further <i>tete-à-tete</i> could
      well occur before their arrival at the house, where there was abundant
      company, to whom Gwendolen, clad in riding-dress, with her hat laid aside,
      clad also in the repute of being chosen by Mr. Grandcourt, was naturally a
      centre of observation; and since the objectionable Mr. Lush was not there
      to look at her, this stimulus of admiring attention heightened her
      spirits, and dispersed, for the time, the uneasy consciousness of divided
      impulses which threatened her with repentance of her own acts. Whether
      Grandcourt had been offended or not there was no judging: his manners were
      unchanged, but Gwendolen&rsquo;s acuteness had not gone deeper than to
      discern that his manners were no clue for her, and because these were
      unchanged she was not the less afraid of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not been at Diplow before except to dine; and since certain points
      of view from the windows and the garden were worth showing, Lady Flora
      Hollis proposed after luncheon, when some of the guests had dispersed, and
      the sun was sloping toward four o&rsquo;clock, that the remaining party
      should make a little exploration. Here came frequent opportunities when
      Grandcourt might have retained Gwendolen apart, and have spoken to her
      unheard. But no! He indeed spoke to no one else, but what he said was
      nothing more eager or intimate than it had been in their first interview.
      He looked at her not less than usual; and some of her defiant spirit
      having come back, she looked full at him in return, not caring&mdash;rather
      preferring&mdash;that his eyes had no expression in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last it seemed as if he entertained some contrivance. After they
      had nearly made the tour of the grounds, the whole party stopped by the
      pool to be amused with Fetch&rsquo;s accomplishment of bringing a water
      lily to the bank like Cowper&rsquo;s spaniel Beau, and having been
      disappointed in his first attempt insisted on his trying again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Grandcourt, who stood with Gwendolen outside the group, turned
      deliberately, and fixing his eyes on a knoll planted with American shrubs,
      and having a winding path up it, said languidly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a bore. Shall we go up there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly&mdash;since we are exploring,&rdquo; said Gwendolen.
      She was rather pleased, and yet afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path was too narrow for him to offer his arm, and they walked up in
      silence. When they were on the bit of platform at the summit, Grandcourt
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to be seen here: the thing was not worth climbing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How was it that Gwendolen did not laugh? She was perfectly silent, holding
      up the folds of her robe like a statue, and giving a harder grasp to the
      handle of her whip, which she had snatched up automatically with her hat
      when they had first set off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a place do you prefer?&rdquo; said Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Different places are agreeable in their way. On the whole, I think,
      I prefer places that are open and cheerful. I am not fond of anything
      sombre.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your place of Offendene is too sombre....&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, rather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not remain there long, I hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I think so. Mamma likes to be near her sister.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence for a short space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not to be supposed that <i>you</i> will always live there,
      though Mrs. Davilow may.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. We women can&rsquo;t go in search of adventures&mdash;to
      find out the North-West Passage or the source of the Nile, or to hunt
      tigers in the East. We must stay where we grow, or where the gardeners
      like to transplant us. We are brought up like the flowers, to look as
      pretty as we can, and be dull without complaining. That is my notion about
      the plants; they are often bored, and that is the reason why some of them
      have got poisonous. What do you think?&rdquo; Gwendolen had run on rather
      nervously, lightly whipping the rhododendron bush in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree. Most things are bores,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, his
      mind having been pushed into an easy current, away from its intended
      track. But, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, he continued in his broken,
      refined drawl,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a woman can be married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some women can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, certainly, unless you are obstinately cruel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that I am not both cruel and obstinate.&rdquo; Here
      Gwendolen suddenly turned her head and looked full at Grandcourt, whose
      eyes she had felt to be upon her throughout their conversation. She was
      wondering what the effect of looking at him would be on herself rather
      than on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood perfectly still, half a yard or more away from her; and it
      flashed through her mind what a sort of lotus-eater&rsquo;s stupor had
      begun in him and was taking possession of her. Then he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you as uncertain about yourself as you make others about you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite uncertain about myself; I don&rsquo;t know how uncertain
      others may be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you wish them to understand that you don&rsquo;t care?&rdquo;
      said Grandcourt, with a touch of new hardness in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say that,&rdquo; Gwendolen replied, hesitatingly, and
      turning her eyes away whipped the rhododendron bush again. She wished she
      were on horseback that she might set off on a canter. It was impossible to
      set off running down the knoll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do care, then,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, not more quickly, but
      with a softened drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! my whip!&rdquo; said Gwendolen, in a little scream of distress.
      She had let it go&mdash;what could be more natural in a slight agitation?&mdash;and&mdash;but
      this seemed less natural in a gold-handled whip which had been left
      altogether to itself&mdash;it had gone with some force over the immediate
      shrubs, and had lodged itself in the branches of an azalea half-way down
      the knoll. She could run down now, laughing prettily, and Grandcourt was
      obliged to follow; but she was beforehand with him in rescuing the whip,
      and continued on her way to the level ground, when she paused and looked
      at Grandcourt with an exasperating brightness in her glance and a
      heightened color, as if she had carried a triumph, and these indications
      were still noticeable to Mrs. Davilow when Gwendolen and Grandcourt joined
      the rest of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all coquetting,&rdquo; thought Grandcourt; &ldquo;the next
      time I beckon she will come down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him likely that this final beckoning might happen the very
      next day, when there was to be a picnic archery meeting in Cardell Chase,
      according to the plan projected on the evening of the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in Gwendolen&rsquo;s mind that result was one of two likelihoods that
      presented themselves alternately, one of two decisions toward which she
      was being precipitated, as if they were two sides of a boundary-line, and
      she did not know on which she should fall. This subjection to a possible
      self, a self not to be absolutely predicted about, caused her some
      astonishment and terror; her favorite key of life&mdash;doing as she liked&mdash;seemed
      to fail her, and she could not foresee what at a given moment she might
      like to do. The prospect of marrying Grandcourt really seemed more
      attractive to her than she had believed beforehand that any marriage could
      be: the dignities, the luxuries, the power of doing a great deal of what
      she liked to do, which had now come close to her, and within her choice to
      secure or to lose, took hold of her nature as if it had been the strong
      odor of what she had only imagined and longed for before. And Grandcourt
      himself? He seemed as little of a flaw in his fortunes as a lover and
      husband could possibly be. Gwendolen wished to mount the chariot and drive
      the plunging horses herself, with a spouse by her side who would fold his
      arms and give her his countenance without looking ridiculous. Certainly,
      with all her perspicacity, and all the reading which seemed to her mamma
      dangerously instructive, her judgment was consciously a little at fault
      before Grandcourt. He was adorably quiet and free from absurdities&mdash;he
      would be a husband to suit with the best appearance a woman could make.
      But what else was he? He had been everywhere, and seen everything. <i>That</i>
      was desirable, and especially gratifying as a preamble to his supreme
      preference for Gwendolen Harleth. He did not appear to enjoy anything
      much. That was not necessary: and the less he had of particular tastes, or
      desires, the more freedom his wife was likely to have in following hers.
      Gwendolen conceived that after marriage she would most probably be able to
      manage him thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      How was it that he caused her unusual constraint now?&mdash;that she was
      less daring and playful in her talk with him than with any other admirer
      she had known? That absence of demonstrativeness which she was glad of,
      acted as a charm in more senses than one, and was slightly benumbing.
      Grandcourt after all was formidable&mdash;a handsome lizard of a hitherto
      unknown species, not of the lively, darting kind. But Gwendolen knew
      hardly anything about lizards, and ignorance gives one a large range of
      probabilities. This splendid specimen was probably gentle, suitable as a
      boudoir pet: what may not a lizard be, if you know nothing to the
      contrary? Her acquaintance with Grandcourt was such that no accomplishment
      suddenly revealed in him would have surprised her. And he was so little
      suggestive of drama, that it hardly occurred to her to think with any
      detail how his life of thirty-six years had been passed: in general, she
      imagined him always cold and dignified, not likely ever to have committed
      himself. He had hunted the tiger&mdash;had he ever been in love or made
      love? The one experience and the other seemed alike remote in Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      fancy from the Mr. Grandcourt who had come to Diplow in order apparently
      to make a chief epoch in her destiny&mdash;perhaps by introducing her to
      that state of marriage which she had resolved to make a state of greater
      freedom than her girlhood. And on the whole she wished to marry him; he
      suited her purpose; her prevailing, deliberate intention was, to accept
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was she going to fulfill her deliberate intention? She began to be
      afraid of herself, and to find out a certain difficulty in doing as she
      liked. Already her assertion of independence in evading his advances had
      been carried farther than was necessary, and she was thinking with some
      anxiety what she might do on the next occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated according to her habit with her back to the horses on their drive
      homeward, she was completely under the observation of her mamma, who took
      the excitement and changefulness in the expression of her eyes, her
      unwonted absence of mind and total silence, as unmistakable signs that
      something unprecedented had occurred between her and Grandcourt. Mrs.
      Davilow&rsquo;s uneasiness determined her to risk some speech on the
      subject: the Gascoignes were to dine at Offendene, and in what had
      occurred this morning there might be some reason for consulting the
      rector; not that she expected him anymore than herself to influence
      Gwendolen, but that her anxious mind wanted to be disburdened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has happened, dear?&rdquo; she began, in a tender tone of
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen looked round, and seeming to be roused to the consciousness of
      her physical self, took off her gloves and then her hat, that the soft
      breeze might blow on her head. They were in a retired bit of the road,
      where the long afternoon shadows from the bordering trees fell across it
      and no observers were within sight. Her eyes continued to meet her mother&rsquo;s,
      but she did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Grandcourt has been saying something?&mdash;Tell me, dear.&rdquo;
      The last words were uttered beseechingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to tell you, mamma?&rdquo; was the perverse answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure something has agitated you. You ought to confide in me,
      Gwen. You ought not to leave me in doubt and anxiety.&rdquo; Mrs. Davilow&rsquo;s
      eyes filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, dear, please don&rsquo;t be miserable,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, with pettish remonstrance. &ldquo;It only makes me more so. I
      am in doubt myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Mr. Grandcourt&rsquo;s intentions?&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow,
      gathering determination from her alarms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not at all,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with some curtness, and a
      pretty little toss of the head as she put on her hat again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About whether you will accept him, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you given him a doubtful answer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given him no answer at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He <i>has</i> spoken so that you could not misunderstand him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I would let him speak.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You expect him to persevere?&rdquo; Mrs. Davilow put this question
      rather anxiously, and receiving no answer, asked another: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      consider that you have discouraged him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you liked him, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I do, mamma, as liking goes. There is less to dislike about him
      than about most men. He is quiet and <i>distingué</i>.&rdquo; Gwendolen so
      far spoke with a pouting sort of gravity; but suddenly she recovered some
      of her mischievousness, and her face broke into a smile as she added&mdash;&ldquo;Indeed
      he has all the qualities that would make a husband tolerable&mdash;battlement,
      veranda, stable, etc., no grins and no glass in his eye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do be serious with me for a moment, dear. Am I to understand that
      you mean to accept him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pray, mamma, leave me to myself,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a
      pettish distress in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Davilow said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got home Gwendolen declared that she would not dine. She was
      tired, and would come down in the evening after she had taken some rest.
      The probability that her uncle would hear what had passed did not trouble
      her. She was convinced that whatever he might say would be on the side of
      her accepting Grandcourt, and she wished to accept him if she could. At
      this moment she would willingly have had weights hung on her own caprice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gascoigne did hear&mdash;not Gwendolen&rsquo;s answers repeated
      verbatim, but a softened generalized account of them. The mother conveyed
      as vaguely as the keen rector&rsquo;s questions would let her the
      impression that Gwendolen was in some uncertainty about her own mind, but
      inclined on the whole to acceptance. The result was that the uncle felt
      himself called on to interfere; he did not conceive that he should do his
      duty in witholding direction from his niece in a momentous crisis of this
      kind. Mrs. Davilow ventured a hesitating opinion that perhaps it would be
      safer to say nothing&mdash;Gwendolen was so sensitive (she did not like to
      say willful). But the rector&rsquo;s was a firm mind, grasping its first
      judgments tenaciously and acting on them promptly, whence
      counter-judgments were no more for him than shadows fleeting across the
      solid ground to which he adjusted himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This match with Grandcourt presented itself to him as a sort of public
      affair; perhaps there were ways in which it might even strengthen the
      establishment. To the rector, whose father (nobody would have suspected
      it, and nobody was told) had risen to be a provincial corn-dealer,
      aristocratic heirship resembled regal heirship in excepting its possessor
      from the ordinary standard of moral judgments, Grandcourt, the almost
      certain baronet, the probable peer, was to be ranged with public
      personages, and was a match to be accepted on broad general grounds
      national and ecclesiastical. Such public personages, it is true, are often
      in the nature of giants which an ancient community may have felt pride and
      safety in possessing, though, regarded privately, these born eminences
      must often have been inconvenient and even noisome. But of the future
      husband personally Mr. Gascoigne was disposed to think the best. Gossip is
      a sort of smoke that comes from the dirty tobacco-pipes of those who
      diffuse it: it proves nothing but the bad taste of the smoker. But if
      Grandcourt had really made any deeper or more unfortunate experiments in
      folly than were common in young men of high prospects, he was of an age to
      have finished them. All accounts can be suitably wound up when a man has
      not ruined himself, and the expense may be taken as an insurance against
      future error. This was the view of practical wisdom; with reference to
      higher views, repentance had a supreme moral and religious value. There
      was every reason to believe that a woman of well-regulated mind would be
      happy with Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no surprise to Gwendolen on coming down to tea to be told that her
      uncle wished to see her in the dining-room. He threw aside the paper as
      she entered and greeted her with his usual kindness. As his wife had
      remarked, he always &ldquo;made much&rdquo; of Gwendolen, and her
      importance had risen of late. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, in a
      fatherly way, moving a chair for her as he held her hand, &ldquo;I want to
      speak to you on a subject which is more momentous than any other with
      regard to your welfare. You will guess what I mean. But I shall speak to
      you with perfect directness: in such matters I consider myself bound to
      act as your father. You have no objection, I hope?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, no, uncle. You have always been very kind to me,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, frankly. This evening she was willing, if it were
      possible, to be a little fortified against her troublesome self, and her
      resistant temper was in abeyance. The rector&rsquo;s mode of speech always
      conveyed a thrill of authority, as of a word of command: it seemed to take
      for granted that there could be no wavering in the audience, and that
      every one was going to be rationally obedient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is naturally a satisfaction to me that the prospect of a
      marriage for you&mdash;advantageous in the highest degree&mdash;has
      presented itself so early. I do not know exactly what has passed between
      you and Mr. Grandcourt, but I presume there can be little doubt, from the
      way in which he has distinguished you, that he desires to make you his
      wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen did not speak immediately, and her uncle said with more
      emphasis,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any doubt of that yourself, my dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that is what he has been thinking of. But he may have
      changed his mind to-morrow,&rdquo; said Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why to-morrow? Has he made advances which you have discouraged?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he meant&mdash;he began to make advances&mdash;but I did
      not encourage them. I turned the conversation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you confide in me so far as to tell me your reasons?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that I had any reasons, uncle.&rdquo; Gwendolen
      laughed rather artificially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite capable of reflecting, Gwendolen. You are aware that
      this is not a trivial occasion, and it concerns your establishment for
      life under circumstances which may not occur again. You have a duty here
      both to yourself and your family. I wish to understand whether you have
      any ground for hesitating as to your acceptance of Mr. Grandcourt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I hesitate without grounds.&rdquo; Gwendolen spoke rather
      poutingly, and her uncle grew suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he disagreeable to you personally?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard anything of him which has affected you disagreeably?&rdquo;
      The rector thought it impossible that Gwendolen could have heard the
      gossip he had heard, but in any case he must endeavor to put all things in
      the right light for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard nothing about him except that he is a great match,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, with some sauciness; &ldquo;and that affects me very
      agreeably.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear Gwendolen, I have nothing further to say than this:
      you hold your fortune in your own hands&mdash;a fortune such as rarely
      happens to a girl in your circumstances&mdash;a fortune in fact which
      almost takes the question out of the range of mere personal feeling, and
      makes your acceptance of it a duty. If Providence offers you power and
      position&mdash;especially when unclogged by any conditions that are
      repugnant to you&mdash;your course is one of responsibility, into which
      caprice must not enter. A man does not like to have his attachment trifled
      with: he may not be at once repelled&mdash;these things are matters of
      individual disposition. But the trifling may be carried too far. And I
      must point out to you that in case Mr. Grandcourt were repelled without
      your having refused him&mdash;without your having intended ultimately to
      refuse him, your situation would be a humiliating and painful one. I, for
      my part, should regard you with severe disapprobation, as the victim of
      nothing else than your own coquetry and folly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen became pallid as she listened to this admonitory speech. The
      ideas it raised had the force of sensations. Her resistant courage would
      not help her here, because her uncle was not urging her against her own
      resolve; he was pressing upon her the motives of dread which she already
      felt; he was making her more conscious of the risks that lay within
      herself. She was silent, and the rector observed that he had produced some
      strong effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean this in kindness, my dear.&rdquo; His tone had softened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware of that, uncle,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, rising and
      shaking her head back, as if to rouse herself out of painful passivity.
      &ldquo;I am not foolish. I know that I must be married some time&mdash;before
      it is too late. And I don&rsquo;t see how I could do better than marry Mr.
      Grandcourt. I mean to accept him, if possible.&rdquo; She felt as if she
      were reinforcing herself by speaking with this decisiveness to her uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the rector was a little startled by so bare a version of his own
      meaning from those young lips. He wished that in her mind his advice
      should be taken in an infusion of sentiments proper to a girl, and such as
      are presupposed in the advice of a clergyman, although he may not consider
      them always appropriate to be put forward. He wished his niece parks,
      carriages, a title&mdash;everything that would make this world a pleasant
      abode; but he wished her not to be cynical&mdash;to be, on the contrary,
      religiously dutiful, and have warm domestic affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Gwendolen,&rdquo; he said, rising also, and speaking with
      benignant gravity, &ldquo;I trust that you will find in marriage a new
      fountain of duty and affection. Marriage is the only true and satisfactory
      sphere of a woman, and if your marriage with Mr. Grandcourt should be
      happily decided upon, you will have, probably, an increasing power, both
      of rank and wealth, which may be used for the benefit of others. These
      considerations are something higher than romance! You are fitted by
      natural gifts for a position which, considering your birth and early
      prospects, could hardly be looked forward to as in the ordinary course of
      things; and I trust that you will grace it, not only by those personal
      gifts, but by a good and consistent life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope mamma will be the happier,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, in a more
      cheerful way, lifting her hands backward to her neck and moving toward the
      door. She wanted to waive those higher considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gascoigne felt that he had come to a satisfactory understanding with
      his niece, and had furthered her happy settlement in life by furthering
      her engagement to Grandcourt. Meanwhile there was another person to whom
      the contemplation of that issue had been a motive for some activity, and
      who believed that he, too, on this particular day had done something
      toward bringing about a favorable decision in <i>his</i> sense&mdash;which
      happened to be the reverse of the rector&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lush&rsquo;s absence from Diplow during Gwendolen&rsquo;s visit had
      been due, not to any fear on his part of meeting that supercilious young
      lady, or of being abashed by her frank dislike, but to an engagement from
      which he expected important consequences. He was gone, in fact, to the
      Wanchester station to meet a lady, accompanied by a maid and two children,
      whom he put into a fly, and afterward followed to the hotel of the Golden
      Keys, in that town. An impressive woman, whom many would turn to look at
      again in passing; her figure was slim and sufficiently tall, her face
      rather emaciated, so that its sculpturesque beauty was the more
      pronounced, her crisp hair perfectly black, and her large, anxious eyes
      what we call black. Her dress was soberly correct, her age, perhaps,
      physically more advanced than the number of years would imply, but hardly
      less than seven-and-thirty. An uneasy-looking woman: her glance seemed to
      presuppose that the people and things were going to be unfavorable to her,
      while she was, nevertheless, ready to meet them with resolution. The
      children were lovely&mdash;a dark-haired girl of six or more, a fairer boy
      of five. When Lush incautiously expressed some surprise at her having
      brought the children, she said, with a sharp-toned intonation,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you suppose I should come wandering about here by myself? Why
      should I not bring all four if I liked?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; said Lush, with his usual fluent <i>nonchalance</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed an hour or so in conference with her, and rode back to Diplow in
      a state of mind that was at once hopeful and busily anxious as to the
      execution of the little plan on which his hopefulness was based.
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s marriage to Gwendolen Harleth would not, he believed,
      be much of a good to either of them, and it would plainly be fraught with
      disagreeables to himself. But now he felt confident enough to say
      inwardly, &ldquo;I will take, nay, I will lay odds that the marriage will
      never happen.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I will not clothe myself in wreck&mdash;wear gems
  Sawed from cramped finger-bones of women drowned;
  Feel chilly vaporous hands of ireful ghosts
  Clutching my necklace: trick my maiden breast
  With orphans&rsquo; heritage. Let your dead love
  Marry its dead.
</pre>
    <p>
      Gwendolen looked lovely and vigorous as a tall, newly-opened lily the next
      morning: there was a reaction of young energy in her, and yesterday&rsquo;s
      self-distrust seemed no more than the transient shiver on the surface of a
      full stream. The roving archery match in Cardell Chase was a delightful
      prospect for the sport&rsquo;s sake: she felt herself beforehand moving
      about like a wood-nymph under the beeches (in appreciative company), and
      the imagined scene lent a charm to further advances on the part of
      Grandcourt&mdash;not an impassioned lyrical Daphnis for the wood-nymph,
      certainly: but so much the better. To-day Gwendolen foresaw him making
      slow conversational approaches to a declaration, and foresaw herself
      awaiting and encouraging it according to the rational conclusion which she
      had expressed to her uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came down to breakfast (after every one had left the table except
      Mrs. Davilow) there were letters on her plate. One of them she read with a
      gathering smile, and then handed it to her mamma, who, on returning it,
      smiled also, finding new cheerfulness in the good spirits her daughter had
      shown ever since waking, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel inclined to go a thousand miles away?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly so far.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a sad omission not to have written again before this. Can&rsquo;t
      you write now&mdash;before we set out this morning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so pressing. To-morrow will do. You see they leave town
      to-day. I must write to Dover. They will be there till Monday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I write for you, dear&mdash;if it teases you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen did not speak immediately, but after sipping her coffee,
      answered brusquely, &ldquo;Oh no, let it be; I will write to-morrow.&rdquo;
      Then, feeling a touch of compunction, she looked up and said with playful
      tenderness, &ldquo;Dear, old, beautiful mamma!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old, child, truly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t, mamma! I meant old for darling. You are hardly
      twenty-five years older than I am. When you talk in that way my life
      shrivels up before me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can have a great deal of happiness in twenty-five years, my
      dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must lose no time in beginning,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, merrily.
      &ldquo;The sooner I get my palaces and coaches the better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a good husband who adores you, Gwen,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow,
      encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen put out her lips saucily and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a slight drawback on her pleasure in starting that the rector was
      detained by magistrate&rsquo;s business, and would probably not be able to
      get to Cardell Chase at all that day. She cared little that Mrs. Gascoigne
      and Anna chose not to go without him, but her uncle&rsquo;s presence would
      have seemed to make it a matter of course that the decision taken would be
      acted on. For decision in itself began to be formidable. Having come close
      to accepting Grandcourt, Gwendolen felt this lot of unhoped-for fullness
      rounding itself too definitely. When we take to wishing a great deal for
      ourselves, whatever we get soon turns into mere limitation and exclusion.
      Still there was the reassuring thought that marriage would be the gate
      into a larger freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place of meeting was a grassy spot called Green Arbor, where a bit of
      hanging wood made a sheltering amphitheatre. It was here that the coachful
      of servants with provisions had to prepare the picnic meal; and the warden
      of the Chase was to guide the roving archers so as to keep them within the
      due distance from this centre, and hinder them from wandering beyond the
      limit which had been fixed on&mdash;a curve that might be drawn through
      certain well-known points, such as the double Oak, the Whispering Stones,
      and the High Cross. The plan was to take only a preliminary stroll before
      luncheon, keeping the main roving expedition for the more exquisite lights
      of the afternoon. The muster was rapid enough to save every one from dull
      moments of waiting, and when the groups began to scatter themselves
      through the light and shadow made here by closely neighboring beeches and
      there by rarer oaks, one may suppose that a painter would have been glad
      to look on. This roving archery was far prettier than the stationary game,
      but success in shooting at variable marks were less favored by practice,
      and the hits were distributed among the volunteer archers otherwise than
      they would have been in target-shooting. From this cause, perhaps, as well
      as from the twofold distraction of being preoccupied and wishing not to
      betray her preoccupation, Gwendolen did not greatly distinguish herself in
      these first experiments, unless it were by the lively grace with which she
      took her comparative failure. She was in white and green as on the day of
      the former meeting, when it made an epoch for her that she was introduced
      to Grandcourt; he was continually by her side now, yet it would have been
      hard to tell from mere looks and manners that their relation to each other
      had at all changed since their first conversation. Still there were other
      grounds that made most persons conclude them to be, if not engaged
      already, on the eve of being so. And she believed this herself. As they
      were all returning toward Green Arbor in divergent groups, not thinking at
      all of taking aim but merely chattering, words passed which seemed really
      the beginning of that end&mdash;the beginning of her acceptance.
      Grandcourt said, &ldquo;Do you know how long it is since I first saw you
      in this dress?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The archery meeting was on the 25th, and this is the 13th,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, laughingly. &ldquo;I am not good at calculating, but I
      will venture to say that it must be nearly three weeks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A little pause, and then he said, &ldquo;That is a great loss of time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That your knowing me has caused you? Pray don&rsquo;t be
      uncomplimentary; I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pause again. &ldquo;It is because of the gain that I feel the loss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Gwendolen herself left a pause. She was thinking, &ldquo;He is really
      very ingenious. He never speaks stupidly.&rdquo; Her silence was so
      unusual that it seemed the strongest of favorable answers, and he
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gain of knowing you makes me feel the time I lose in
      uncertainty. Do <i>you</i> like uncertainty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I do, rather,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, suddenly beaming on
      him with a playful smile. &ldquo;There is more in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt met her laughing eyes with a slow, steady look right into them,
      which seemed like vision in the abstract, and then said, &ldquo;Do you
      mean more torment for me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something so strange to Gwendolen in this moment that she was
      quite shaken out of her usual self-consciousness. Blushing and turning
      away her eyes, she said, &ldquo;No, that would make me sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt would have followed up this answer, which the change in her
      manner made apparently decisive of her favorable intention; but he was not
      in any way overcome so as to be unaware that they were now, within sight
      of everybody, descending the space into Green Arbor, and descending it at
      an ill-chosen point where it began to be inconveniently steep. This was a
      reason for offering his hand in the literal sense to help her; she took
      it, and they came down in silence, much observed by those already on the
      level&mdash;among others by Mrs. Arrowpoint, who happened to be standing
      with Mrs. Davilow. That lady had now made up her mind that Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      merits were not such as would have induced Catherine to accept him,
      Catherine having so high a standard as to have refused Lord Slogan. Hence
      she looked at the tenant of Diplow with dispassionate eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Grandcourt is not equal as a man to his uncle, Sir Hugo
      Mallinger&mdash;too languid. To be sure, Mr. Grandcourt is a much younger
      man, but I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if Sir Hugo were to outlive him,
      notwithstanding the difference of years. It is ill calculating on
      successions,&rdquo; concluded Mrs. Arrowpoint, rather too loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, able to assent with quiet
      cheerfulness, for she was so well satisfied with the actual situation of
      affairs that her habitual melancholy in their general unsatisfactoriness
      was altogether in abeyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not concerned to tell of the food that was eaten in that green
      refectory, or even to dwell on the stories of the forest scenery that
      spread themselves out beyond the level front of the hollow; being just now
      bound to tell a story of life at a stage when the blissful beauty of earth
      and sky entered only by narrow and oblique inlets into the consciousness,
      which was busy with a small social drama almost as little penetrated by a
      feeling of wider relations as if it had been a puppet-show. It will be
      understood that the food and champagne were of the best&mdash;the talk and
      laughter too, in the sense of belonging to the best society, where no one
      makes an invidious display of anything in particular, and the advantages
      of the world are taken with that high-bred depreciation which follows from
      being accustomed to them. Some of the gentlemen strolled a little and
      indulged in a cigar, there being a sufficient interval before, four o&rsquo;clock&mdash;the
      time for beginning to rove again. Among these, strange to say, was
      Grandcourt; but not Mr. Lush, who seemed to be taking his pleasure quite
      generously to-day by making himself particularly serviceable, ordering
      everything for everybody, and by this activity becoming more than ever a
      blot on the scene to Gwendolen, though he kept himself amiably aloof from
      her, and never even looked at her obviously. When there was a general move
      to prepare for starting, it appeared that the bows had all been put under
      the charge of Lord Brackenshaw&rsquo;s valet, and Mr. Lush was concerned
      to save ladies the trouble of fetching theirs from the carriage where they
      were propped. He did not intend to bring Gwendolen&rsquo;s, but she,
      fearful lest he should do so, hurried to fetch it herself. The valet,
      seeing her approach, met her with it, and in giving it into her hand gave
      also a letter addressed to her. She asked no question about it, perceived
      at a glance that the address was in a lady&rsquo;s handwriting (of the
      delicate kind which used to be esteemed feminine before the present uncial
      period), and moving away with her bow in her hand, saw Mr. Lush coming to
      fetch other bows. To avoid meeting him she turned aside and walked with
      her back toward the stand of carriages, opening the letter. It contained
      these words,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    If Miss Harleth is in doubt whether she should accept Mr. Grandcourt,
    let her break from her party after they have passed the Whispering
    Stones and return to that spot. She will then hear something to decide
    her; but she can only hear it by keeping this letter a strict secret
    from every one. If she does not act according to this letter, she will
    repent, as the woman who writes it has repented. The secrecy Miss
    Harleth will feel herself bound in honor to guard.
</pre>
    <p>
      Gwendolen felt an inward shock, but her immediate thought was, &ldquo;It
      is come in time.&rdquo; It lay in her youthfulness that she was absorbed
      by the idea of the revelation to be made, and had not even a momentary
      suspicion of contrivance that could justify her in showing the letter. Her
      mind gathered itself up at once into the resolution, that she would manage
      to go unobserved to the Whispering Stones; and thrusting the letter into
      her pocket she turned back to rejoin the company, with that sense of
      having something to conceal which to her nature had a bracing quality and
      helped her to be mistress of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a surprise to every one that Grandcourt was not, like the other
      smokers, on the spot in time to set out roving with the rest. &ldquo;We
      shall alight on him by-and-by,&rdquo; said Lord Brackenshaw; &ldquo;he can&rsquo;t
      be gone far.&rdquo; At any rate, no man could be waited for. This apparent
      forgetfulness might be taken for the distraction of a lover so absorbed in
      thinking of the beloved object as to forget an appointment which would
      bring him into her actual presence. And the good-natured Earl gave
      Gwendolen a distant jocose hint to that effect, which she took with
      suitable quietude. But the thought in her mind was &ldquo;Can he too be
      starting away from a decision?&rdquo; It was not exactly a pleasant
      thought to her; but it was near the truth. &ldquo;Starting away,&rdquo;
      however, was not the right expression for the languor of intention that
      came over Grandcourt, like a fit of diseased numbness, when an end seemed
      within easy reach: to desist then, when all expectation was to the
      contrary, became another gratification of mere will, sublimely independent
      of definite motive. At that moment he had begun a second large cigar in a
      vague, hazy obstinacy which, if Lush or any other mortal who might be
      insulted with impunity had interrupted by overtaking him with a request
      for his return, would have expressed itself by a slow removal of his
      cigar, to say in an undertone, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be kind enough to go to
      the devil, will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not interrupted, and the rovers set off without any visible
      depression of spirits, leaving behind only a few of the less vigorous
      ladies, including Mrs. Davilow, who preferred a quiet stroll free from
      obligation to keep up with others. The enjoyment of the day was soon at
      its highest pitch, the archery getting more spirited and the changing
      scenes of the forest from roofed grove to open glade growing lovelier with
      the lengthening shadows, and the deeply-felt but undefinable gradations of
      the mellowing afternoon. It was agreed that they were playing an
      extemporized <i>As you like it</i>; and when a pretty compliment had been
      turned to Gwendolen about her having the part of Rosalind, she felt the
      more compelled to be surpassing in loveliness. This was not very difficult
      to her, for the effect of what had happened to-day was an excitement which
      needed a vent&mdash;a sense of adventure rather than alarm, and a
      straining toward the management of her retreat, so as not to be impeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roving had been lasting nearly an hour before the arrival at the
      Whispering Stones, two tall conical blocks that leaned toward each other
      like gigantic gray-mantled figures. They were soon surveyed and passed by
      with the remark that they would be good ghosts on a starlit night. But a
      soft sunlight was on them now, and Gwendolen felt daring. The stones were
      near a fine grove of beeches, where the archers found plenty of marks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far are we from Green Arbor now?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, having
      got in front by the side of the warden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not more than half a mile, taking along the avenue we&rsquo;re
      going to cross up there: but I shall take round a couple of miles, by the
      High Cross.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was falling back among the rest, when suddenly they seemed all to be
      hurrying obliquely forward under the guidance of Mr. Lush, and lingering a
      little where she was, she perceived her opportunity of slipping away. Soon
      she was out of sight, and without running she seemed to herself to fly
      along the ground and count the moments nothing till she found herself back
      again at the Whispering Stones. They turned their blank gray sides to her:
      what was there on the other side? If there were nothing after all? That
      was her only dread now&mdash;to have to turn back again in mystification;
      and walking round the right-hand stone without pause, she found herself in
      front of some one whose large dark eyes met hers at a foot&rsquo;s
      distance. In spite of expectation, she was startled and shrank bank, but
      in doing so she could take in the whole figure of this stranger and
      perceive that she was unmistakably a lady, and one who must have been
      exceedingly handsome. She perceived, also, that a few yards from her were
      two children seated on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Harleth?&rdquo; said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; All Gwendolen&rsquo;s consciousness was wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you accepted Mr. Grandcourt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have promised to tell you something. And you will promise to keep
      my secret. However you may decide you will not tell Mr. Grandcourt, or any
      one else, that you have seen me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Lydia Glasher. Mr. Grandcourt ought not to marry any one
      but me. I left my husband and child for him nine years ago. Those two
      children are his, and we have two others&mdash;girls&mdash;who are older.
      My husband is dead now, and Mr. Grandcourt ought to marry me. He ought to
      make that boy his heir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the boy as she spoke, and Gwendolen&rsquo;s eyes followed
      hers. The handsome little fellow was puffing out his cheeks in trying to
      blow a tiny trumpet which remained dumb. His hat hung backward by a
      string, and his brown curls caught the sun-rays. He was a cherub.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women&rsquo;s eyes met again, and Gwendolen said proudly, &ldquo;I
      will not interfere with your wishes.&rdquo; She looked as if she were
      shivering, and her lips were pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very attractive, Miss Harleth. But when he first knew me, I
      too was young. Since then my life has been broken up and embittered. It is
      not fair that he should be happy and I miserable, and my boy thrust out of
      sight for another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were uttered with a biting accent, but with a determined
      abstinence from anything violent in tone or manner. Gwendolen, watching
      Mrs. Glasher&rsquo;s face while she spoke, felt a sort of terror: it was
      as if some ghastly vision had come to her in a dream and said, &ldquo;I am
      a woman&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything more to say to me?&rdquo; she asked in a low
      tone, but still proud and coldly. The revulsion within her was not tending
      to soften her. Everyone seemed hateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. You know what I wished you to know. You can inquire about
      me if you like. My husband was Colonel Glasher.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will go,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, moving away with a
      ceremonious inclination, which was returned with equal grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Gwendolen was in the beech grove again but her party had
      gone out of sight and apparently had not sent in search of her, for all
      was solitude till she had reached the avenue pointed out by the warden.
      She determined to take this way back to Green Arbor, which she reached
      quickly; rapid movements seeming to her just now a means of suspending the
      thoughts which might prevent her from behaving with due calm. She had
      already made up her mind what step she would take.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow was of course astonished to see Gwendolen returning alone,
      and was not without some uneasiness which the presence of other ladies
      hindered her from showing. In answer to her words of surprise Gwendolen
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have been rather silly. I lingered behind to look at the
      Whispering Stones, and the rest hurried on after something, so I lost
      sight of them. I thought it best to come home by the short way&mdash;the
      avenue that the warden had told me of. I&rsquo;m not sorry after all. I
      had had enough walking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your party did not meet Mr. Grandcourt, I presume,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Arrowpoint, not without intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a little flash of defiance, and a
      light laugh. &ldquo;And we didn&rsquo;t see any carvings on the trees,
      either. Where can he be? I should think he has fallen into the pool or had
      an apoplectic fit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With all Gwendolen&rsquo;s resolve not to betray any agitation, she could
      not help it that her tone was unusually high and hard, and her mother felt
      sure that something unpropitious had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arrowpoint thought that the self-confident young lady was much
      piqued, and that Mr. Grandcourt was probably seeing reason to change his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have no objection, mamma, I will order the carriage,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen. &ldquo;I am tired. And every one will be going soon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow assented; but by the time the carriage was announced as ready&mdash;the
      horses having to be fetched from the stables on the warden&rsquo;s
      premises&mdash;the roving party reappeared, and with them Mr. Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there you are!&rdquo; said Lord Brackenshaw, going up to
      Gwendolen, who was arranging her mamma&rsquo;s shawl for the drive.
      &ldquo;We thought at first you had alighted on Grandcourt and he had taken
      you home. Lush said so. But after that we met Grandcourt. However, we didn&rsquo;t
      suppose you could be in any danger. The warden said he had told you a near
      way back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going?&rdquo; said Grandcourt, coming up with his usual
      air, as if he did not conceive that there had been any omission on his
      part. Lord Brackenshaw gave place to him and moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we are going,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, looking busily at her
      scarf, which she was arranging across her shoulders Scotch fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I call at Offendene to-morrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, if you like,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, sweeping him from a
      distance with her eyelashes. Her voice was light and sharp as the first
      touch of frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow accepted his arm to lead her to the carriage; but while that
      was happening, Gwendolen with incredible swiftness had got in advance of
      them, and had sprung into the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got in, mamma, because I wished to be on this side,&rdquo; she
      said, apologetically. But she had avoided Grandcourt&rsquo;s touch: he
      only lifted his hat and walked away&mdash;with the not unsatisfactory
      impression that she meant to show herself offended by his neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother and daughter drove for five minutes in silence. Then Gwendolen
      said, &ldquo;I intend to join the Langens at Dover, mamma. I shall pack up
      immediately on getting home, and set off by the early train. I shall be at
      Dover almost as soon as they are; we can let them know by telegraph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens, child! what can be your reason for saying so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reason for saying it, mamma, is that I mean to do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you mean to do it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to go away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it because you are offended with Mr. Grandcourt&rsquo;s odd
      behavior in walking off to-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is useless to enter into such questions. I am not going in any
      case to marry Mr. Grandcourt. Don&rsquo;t interest yourself further about
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I say to your uncle, Gwendolen? Consider the position you
      place me in. You led him to believe only last night that you had made up
      your mind in favor of Mr. Grandcourt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry to cause you annoyance, mamma, dear, but I can&rsquo;t
      help it,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with still harder resistance in her tone.
      &ldquo;Whatever you or my uncle may think or do, I shall not alter my
      resolve, and I shall not tell my reason. I don&rsquo;t care what comes of
      it. I don&rsquo;t care if I never marry any one. There is nothing worth
      caring for. I believe all men are bad, and I hate them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But need you set off in this way, Gwendolen?&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow, miserable and helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now mamma, don&rsquo;t interfere with me. If you have ever had any
      trouble in your own life, remember it and don&rsquo;t interfere with me.
      If I am to be miserable, let it be by my own choice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother was reduced to trembling silence. She began to see that the
      difficulty would be lessened if Gwendolen went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she did go. The packing was all carefully done that evening, and not
      long after dawn the next day Mrs. Davilow accompanied her daughter to the
      railway station. The sweet dews of morning, the cows and horses looking
      over the hedges without any particular reason, the early travelers on foot
      with their bundles, seemed all very melancholy and purposeless to them
      both. The dingy torpor of the railway station, before the ticket could be
      taken, was still worse. Gwendolen had certainly hardened in the last
      twenty-four hours: her mother&rsquo;s trouble evidently counted for little
      in her present state of mind, which did not essentially differ from the
      mood that makes men take to worse conduct when their belief in persons or
      things is upset. Gwendolen&rsquo;s uncontrolled reading, though consisting
      chiefly in what are called pictures of life, had somehow not prepared her
      for this encounter with reality. Is that surprising? It is to be believed
      that attendance at the <i>opéra bouffe</i> in the present day would not
      leave men&rsquo;s minds entirely without shock, if the manners observed
      there with some applause were suddenly to start up in their own families.
      Perspective, as its inventor remarked, is a beautiful thing. What horrors
      of damp huts, where human beings languish, may not become picturesque
      through aerial distance! What hymning of cancerous vices may we not
      languish over as sublimest art in the safe remoteness of a strange
      language and artificial phrase! Yet we keep a repugnance to rheumatism and
      other painful effects when presented in our personal experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow felt Gwendolen&rsquo;s new phase of indifference keenly, and
      as she drove back alone, the brightening morning was sadder to her than
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grandcourt called that day at Offendene, but nobody was at home.

      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;<i>Festina lente</i>&mdash;celerity should be contempered with
    cunctation.&rdquo;&mdash;SIR THOMAS BROWNE.
</pre>
    <p>
      Gwendolen, we have seen, passed her time abroad in the new excitement of
      gambling, and in imagining herself an empress of luck, having brought from
      her late experience a vague impression that in this confused world it
      signified nothing what any one did, so that they amused themselves. We
      have seen, too, that certain persons, mysteriously symbolized as Grapnell
      &amp; Co., having also thought of reigning in the realm of luck, and being
      also bent on amusing themselves, no matter how, had brought about a
      painful change in her family circumstances; whence she had returned home&mdash;carrying
      with her, against her inclination, a necklace which she had pawned and
      some one else had redeemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was going back to England, Grandcourt was coming to find her;
      coming, that is, after his own manner&mdash;not in haste by express
      straight from Diplow to Leubronn, where she was understood to be; but so
      entirely without hurry that he was induced by the presence of some Russian
      acquaintances to linger at Baden-Baden and make various appointments with
      them, which, however, his desire to be at Leubronn ultimately caused him
      to break. Grandcourt&rsquo;s passions were of the intermittent, flickering
      kind: never flaming out strongly. But a great deal of life goes on without
      strong passion: myriads of cravats are carefully tied, dinners attended,
      even speeches made proposing the health of august personages without the
      zest arising from a strong desire. And a man may make a good appearance in
      high social positions&mdash;may be supposed to know the classics, to have
      his reserves on science, a strong though repressed opinion on politics,
      and all the sentiments of the English gentleman, at a small expense of
      vital energy. Also, he may be obstinate or persistent at the same low
      rate, and may even show sudden impulses which have a false air of daemonic
      strength because they seem inexplicable, though perhaps their secret lies
      merely in the want of regulated channels for the soul to move in&mdash;good
      and sufficient ducts of habit without which our nature easily turns to
      mere ooze and mud, and at any pressure yields nothing but a spurt or a
      puddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt had not been altogether displeased by Gwendolen&rsquo;s running
      away from the splendid chance he was holding out to her. The act had some
      piquancy for him. He liked to think that it was due to resentment of his
      careless behavior in Cardell Chase, which, when he came to consider it,
      did appear rather cool. To have brought her so near a tender admission,
      and then to have walked headlong away from further opportunities of
      winning the consent which he had made her understand him to be asking for,
      was enough to provoke a girl of spirit; and to be worth his mastering it
      was proper that she should have some spirit. Doubtless she meant him to
      follow her, and it was what he meant too. But for a whole week he took no
      measures toward starting, and did not even inquire where Miss Harleth was
      gone. Mr. Lush felt a triumph that was mingled with much distrust; for
      Grandcourt had said no word to him about her, and looked as neutral as an
      alligator; there was no telling what might turn up in the slowly-churning
      chances of his mind. Still, to have put off a decision was to have made
      room for the waste of Grandcourt&rsquo;s energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests at Diplow felt more curiosity than their host. How was it that
      nothing more was heard of Miss Harleth? Was it credible that she had
      refused Mr. Grandcourt? Lady Flora Hollis, a lively middle-aged woman,
      well endowed with curiosity, felt a sudden interest in making a round of
      calls with Mrs. Torrington, including the rectory, Offendene, and
      Quetcham, and thus not only got twice over, but also discussed with the
      Arrowpoints, the information that Miss Harleth was gone to Leubronn, with
      some old friends, the Baron and Baroness von Langen; for the immediate
      agitation and disappointment of Mrs. Davilow and the Gascoignes had
      resolved itself into a wish that Gwendolen&rsquo;s disappearance should
      not be interpreted as anything eccentric or needful to be kept secret. The
      rector&rsquo;s mind, indeed, entertained the possibility that the marriage
      was only a little deferred, for Mrs. Davilow had not dared to tell him of
      the bitter determination with which Gwendolen had spoken. And in spite of
      his practical ability, some of his experience had petrified into maxims
      and quotations. Amaryllis fleeing desired that her hiding-place should be
      known; and that love will find out the way &ldquo;over the mountain and
      over the wave&rdquo; may be said without hyperbole in this age of steam.
      Gwendolen, he conceived, was an Amaryllis of excellent sense but
      coquettish daring; the question was whether she had dared too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Flora, coming back charged with news about Miss Harleth, saw no good
      reason why she should not try whether she could electrify Mr. Grandcourt
      by mentioning it to him at the table; and in doing so shot a few hints of
      a notion having got abroad that he was a disappointed adorer. Grandcourt
      heard with quietude, but with attention; and the next day he ordered Lush
      to bring about a decent reason for breaking up the party at Diplow by the
      end of another week, as he meant to go yachting to the Baltic or somewhere&mdash;it
      being impossible to stay at Diplow as if he were a prisoner on parole,
      with a set of people whom he had never wanted. Lush needed no clearer
      announcement that Grandcourt was going to Leubronn; but he might go after
      the manner of a creeping billiard-ball and stick on the way. What Mr. Lush
      intended was to make himself indispensable so that he might go too, and he
      succeeded; Gwendolen&rsquo;s repulsion for him being a fact that only
      amused his patron, and made him none the less willing to have Lush always
      at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was how it happened that Grandcourt arrived at the <i>Czarina</i> on
      the fifth day after Gwendolen had left Leubronn, and found there his
      uncle, Sir Hugo Mallinger, with his family, including Deronda. It is not
      necessarily a pleasure either to the reigning power or the heir
      presumptive when their separate affairs&mdash;a&mdash;touch of gout, say,
      in the one, and a touch of willfulness in the other&mdash;happen to bring
      them to the same spot. Sir Hugo was an easy-tempered man, tolerant both of
      differences and defects; but a point of view different from his own
      concerning the settlement of the family estates fretted him rather more
      than if it had concerned Church discipline or the ballot, and faults were
      the less venial for belonging to a person whose existence was inconvenient
      to him. In no case could Grandcourt have been a nephew after his own
      heart; but as the presumptive heir to the Mallinger estates he was the
      sign and embodiment of a chief grievance in the baronet&rsquo;s life&mdash;the
      want of a son to inherit the lands, in no portion of which had he himself
      more than a life-interest. For in the ill-advised settlement which his
      father, Sir Francis, had chosen to make by will, even Diplow with its
      modicum of land had been left under the same conditions as the ancient and
      wide inheritance of the two Toppings&mdash;Diplow, where Sir Hugo had
      lived and hunted through many a season in his younger years, and where his
      wife and daughters ought to have been able to retire after his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      This grievance had naturally gathered emphasis as the years advanced, and
      Lady Mallinger, after having had three daughters in quick succession, had
      remained for eight years till now that she was over forty without
      producing so much as another girl; while Sir Hugo, almost twenty years
      older, was at a time of life when, notwithstanding the fashionable
      retardation of most things from dinners to marriages, a man&rsquo;s
      hopefulness is apt to show signs of wear, until restored by second
      childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, he had begun to despair of a son, and this confirmation of
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s interest in the estates certainly tended to make his
      image and presence the more unwelcome; but, on the other hand, it carried
      circumstances which disposed Sir Hugo to take care that the relation
      between them should be kept as friendly as possible. It led him to dwell
      on a plan which had grown up side by side with his disappointment of an
      heir; namely, to try and secure Diplow as a future residence for Lady
      Mallinger and her daughters, and keep this pretty bit of the family
      inheritance for his own offspring in spite of that disappointment. Such
      knowledge as he had of his nephew&rsquo;s disposition and affairs
      encouraged the belief that Grandcourt might consent to a transaction by
      which he would get a good sum of ready money, as an equivalent for his
      prospective interest in the domain of Diplow and the moderate amount of
      land attached to it. If, after all, the unhoped-for son should be born,
      the money would have been thrown away, and Grandcourt would have been paid
      for giving up interests that had turned out good for nothing; but Sir Hugo
      set down this risk as <i>nil</i>, and of late years he had husbanded his
      fortune so well by the working of mines and the sale of leases that he was
      prepared for an outlay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was an object that made him careful to avoid any quarrel with
      Grandcourt. Some years before, when he was making improvements at the
      Abbey, and needed Grandcourt&rsquo;s concurrence in his felling an
      obstructive mass of timber on the demesne, he had congratulated himself on
      finding that there was no active spite against him in his nephew&rsquo;s
      peculiar mind; and nothing had since occurred to make them hate each other
      more than was compatible with perfect politeness, or with any
      accommodation that could be strictly mutual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt, on his side, thought his uncle a superfluity and a bore, and
      felt that the list of things in general would be improved whenever Sir
      Hugo came to be expunged. But he had been made aware through Lush, always
      a useful medium, of the baronet&rsquo;s inclinations concerning Diplow,
      and he was gratified to have the alternative of the money in his mind:
      even if he had not thought it in the least likely that he would choose to
      accept it, his sense of power would have been flattered by his being able
      to refuse what Sir Hugo desired. The hinted transaction had told for
      something among the motives which had made him ask for a year&rsquo;s
      tenancy of Diplow, which it had rather annoyed Sir Hugo to grant, because
      the excellent hunting in the neighborhood might decide Grandcourt not to
      part with his chance of future possession;&mdash;a man who has two places,
      in one of which the hunting is less good, naturally desiring a third where
      it is better. Also, Lush had thrown out to Sir Hugo the probability that
      Grandcourt would woo and win Miss Arrowpoint, and in that case ready money
      might be less of a temptation to him. Hence, on this unexpected meeting at
      Leubronn, the baronet felt much curiosity to know how things had been
      going on at Diplow, was bent on being as civil as possible to his nephew,
      and looked forward to some private chat with Lush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between Deronda and Grandcourt there was a more faintly-marked but
      peculiar relation, depending on circumstances which have yet to be made
      known. But on no side was there any sign of suppressed chagrin on the
      first meeting at the <i>table d&rsquo;hôte</i>, an hour after Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      arrival; and when the quartette of gentlemen afterward met on the terrace,
      without Lady Mallinger, they moved off together to saunter through the
      rooms, Sir Hugo saying as they entered the large <i>saal</i>,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you play much at Baden, Grandcourt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I looked on and betted a little with some Russians there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you luck?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I win, Lush?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You brought away about two hundred,&rdquo; said Lush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not here for the sake of the play, then?&rdquo; said Sir
      Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t care about play now. It&rsquo;s a confounded
      strain,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, whose diamond ring and demeanor, as he
      moved along playing slightly with his whisker, were being a good deal
      stared at by rouged foreigners interested in a new milord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, somebody should invent a mill to do amusements for
      you, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, &ldquo;as the Tartars get their
      praying done. But I agree with you; I never cared for play. It&rsquo;s
      monotonous&mdash;knits the brain up into meshes. And it knocks me up to
      watch it now. I suppose one gets poisoned with the bad air. I never stay
      here more than ten minutes. But where&rsquo;s your gambling beauty,
      Deronda? Have you seen her lately?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Deronda, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An uncommonly fine girl, a perfect Diana,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo,
      turning to Grandcourt again. &ldquo;Really worth a little straining to
      look at her. I saw her winning, and she took it as coolly as if she had
      known it all beforehand. The same day Deronda happened to see her losing
      like wildfire, and she bore it with immense pluck. I suppose she was
      cleaned out, or was wise enough to stop in time. How do you know she&rsquo;s
      gone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by the Visitor-list,...&rdquo; said Deronda, with a scarcely
      perceptible shrug. &ldquo;Vandernoodt told me her name was Harleth, and
      she was with the Baron and Baroness von Langen. I saw by the list that
      Miss Harleth was no longer there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This held no further information for Lush than that Gwendolen had been
      gambling. He had already looked at the list, and ascertained that
      Gwendolen had gone, but he had no intention of thrusting this knowledge on
      Grandcourt before he asked for it; and he had not asked, finding it enough
      to believe that the object of search would turn up somewhere or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now Grandcourt had heard what was rather piquant, and not a word about
      Miss Harleth had been missed by him. After a moment&rsquo;s pause he said
      to Deronda,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know those people&mdash;the Langens?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have talked with them a little since Miss Harleth went away. I
      knew nothing of them before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she gone&mdash;do you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is gone home,&rdquo; said Deronda, coldly, as if he wished to
      say no more. But then, from a fresh impulse, he turned to look markedly at
      Grandcourt, and added, &ldquo;But it is possible you know her. Her home is
      not far from Diplow: Offendene, near Winchester.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda, turning to look straight at Grandcourt, who was on his left hand,
      might have been a subject for those old painters who liked contrasts of
      temperament. There was a calm intensity of life and richness of tint in
      his face that on a sudden gaze from him was rather startling, and often
      made him seem to have spoken, so that servants and officials asked him
      automatically, &ldquo;What did you say, sir?&rdquo; when he had been quite
      silent. Grandcourt himself felt an irritation, which he did not show
      except by a slight movement of the eyelids, at Deronda&rsquo;s turning
      round on him when he was not asked to do more than speak. But he answered,
      with his usual drawl, &ldquo;Yes, I know her,&rdquo; and paused with his
      shoulder toward Deronda, to look at the gambling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of her, eh?&rdquo; asked Sir Hugo of Lush, as the three moved
      on a little way. &ldquo;She must be a new-comer at Offendene. Old Blenny
      lived there after the dowager died.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little too much of her,&rdquo; said Lush, in a low, significant
      tone; not sorry to let Sir Hugo know the state of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? how?&rdquo; said the baronet. They all moved out of the <i>salon</i>
      into an airy promenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been on the brink of marrying her,&rdquo; Lush went on.
      &ldquo;But I hope it&rsquo;s off now. She&rsquo;s a niece of the clergyman&mdash;Gascoigne&mdash;at
      Pennicote. Her mother is a widow with a brood of daughters. This girl will
      have nothing, and is as dangerous as gunpowder. It would be a foolish
      marriage. But she has taken a freak against him, for she ran off here
      without notice, when he had agreed to call the next day. The fact is, he&rsquo;s
      here after her; but he was in no great hurry, and between his caprice and
      hers they are likely enough not to get together again. But of course he
      has lost his chance with the heiress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt joining them said, &ldquo;What a beastly den this is!&mdash;a
      worse hole than Baden. I shall go back to the hotel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sir Hugo and Deronda were alone, the baronet began,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a pretty story. That girl has something in her. She must be
      worth running after&mdash;has <i>de l&rsquo;imprévu</i>. I think her
      appearance on the scene has bettered my chance of getting Diplow, whether
      the marriage comes off or not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope a marriage like that would not come off,&rdquo; said
      Deronda, in a tone of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! are you a little touched with the sublime lash?&rdquo; said
      Sir Hugo, putting up his glasses to help his short sight in looking at his
      companion. &ldquo;Are you inclined to run after her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Deronda, &ldquo;I should rather be
      inclined to run away from her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you would easily cut out Grandcourt. A girl with her spirit
      would think you the finer match of the two,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, who
      often tried Deronda&rsquo;s patience by finding a joke in impossible
      advice. (A difference of taste in jokes is a great strain on the
      affections.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose pedigree and land belong to a fine match,&rdquo; said
      Deronda, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best horse will win in spite of pedigree, my boy. You remember
      Napoleon&rsquo;s <i>mot&mdash;Je suis un ancêtre</i>&rdquo; said Sir Hugo,
      who habitually undervalued birth, as men after dining well often agree
      that the good of life is distributed with wonderful equality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that I want to be an ancestor,&rdquo; said Deronda.
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me the rarest sort of origination.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t run after the pretty gambler, then?&rdquo; said Sir
      Hugo, putting down his glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This answer was perfectly truthful; nevertheless it had passed through
      Deronda&rsquo;s mind that under other circumstances he should have given
      way to the interest this girl had raised in him, and tried to know more of
      her. But his history had given him a stronger bias in another direction.
      He felt himself in no sense free.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Men, like planets, have both a visible and an invisible history. The
    astronomer threads the darkness with strict deduction, accounting so
    for every visible arc in the wanderer&rsquo;s orbit; and the narrator of
    human actions, if he did his work with the same completeness, would
    have to thread the hidden pathways of feeling and thought which lead
    up to every moment of action, and to those moments of intense
    suffering which take the quality of action&mdash;like the cry of
    Prometheus, whose chained anguish seems a greater energy than the sea
    and sky he invokes and the deity he defies.
</pre>
    <p>
      Deronda&rsquo;s circumstances, indeed, had been exceptional. One moment
      had been burned into his life as its chief epoch&mdash;a moment full of
      July sunshine and large pink roses shedding their last petals on a grassy
      court enclosed on three sides by a gothic cloister. Imagine him in such a
      scene: a boy of thirteen, stretched prone on the grass where it was in
      shadow, his curly head propped on his arms over a book, while his tutor,
      also reading, sat on a camp-stool under shelter. Deronda&rsquo;s book was
      Sismondi&rsquo;s <i>History of the Italian Republics</i>; the lad had a
      passion for history, eager to know how time had been filled up since the
      flood, and how things were carried on in the dull periods. Suddenly he let
      down his left arm and looked at his tutor, saying in purest boyish tones,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fraser, how was it that the popes and cardinals always had so
      many nephews?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tutor, an able young Scotchman, who acted as Sir Hugo Mallinger&rsquo;s
      secretary, roused rather unwillingly from his political economy, answered
      with the clear-cut emphatic chant which makes a truth doubly telling in
      Scotch utterance,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their own children were called nephews.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just for the propriety of the thing; because, as you know
      very well, priests don&rsquo;t marry, and the children were illegitimate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fraser, thrusting out his lower lip and making his chant of the last
      word the more emphatic for a little impatience at being interrupted, had
      already turned his eyes on his book again, while Deronda, as if something
      had stung him, started up in a sitting attitude with his back to the
      tutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had always called Sir Hugo Mallinger his uncle, and when it once
      occurred to him to ask about his father and mother, the baronet had
      answered, &ldquo;You lost your father and mother when you were quite a
      little one; that is why I take care of you.&rdquo; Daniel then straining
      to discern something in that early twilight, had a dim sense of having
      been kissed very much, and surrounded by thin, cloudy, scented drapery,
      till his fingers caught in something hard, which hurt him, and he began to
      cry. Every other memory he had was of the little world in which he still
      lived. And at that time he did not mind about learning more, for he was
      too fond of Sir Hugo to be sorry for the loss of unknown parents. Life was
      very delightful to the lad, with an uncle who was always indulgent and
      cheerful&mdash;a fine man in the bright noon of life, whom Daniel thought
      absolutely perfect, and whose place was one of the finest in England, at
      once historical, romantic, and home-like: a picturesque architectural
      outgrowth from an abbey, which had still remnants of the old monastic
      trunk. Diplow lay in another county, and was a comparatively landless
      place which had come into the family from a rich lawyer on the female side
      who wore the perruque of the restoration; whereas the Mallingers had the
      grant of Monk&rsquo;s Topping under Henry the Eighth, and ages before had
      held the neighboring lands of King&rsquo;s Topping, tracing indeed their
      origin to a certain Hugues le Malingre, who came in with the Conqueror&mdash;and
      also apparently with a sickly complexion which had been happily corrected
      in his descendants. Two rows of these descendants, direct and collateral,
      females of the male line, and males of the female, looked down in the
      gallery over the cloisters on the nephew Daniel as he walked there: men in
      armor with pointed beards and arched eyebrows, pinched ladies in hoops and
      ruffs with no face to speak of; grave-looking men in black velvet and
      stuffed hips, and fair, frightened women holding little boys by the hand;
      smiling politicians in magnificent perruques, and ladies of the
      prize-animal kind, with rosebud mouths and full eyelids, according to
      Lely; then a generation whose faces were revised and embellished in the
      taste of Kneller; and so on through refined editions of the family types
      in the time of Reynolds and Romney, till the line ended with Sir Hugo and
      his younger brother Henleigh. This last had married Miss Grandcourt, and
      taken her name along with her estates, thus making a junction between two
      equally old families, impaling the three Saracens&rsquo; heads proper and
      three bezants of the one with the tower and falcons <i>argent</i> of the
      other, and, as it happened, uniting their highest advantages in the
      prospects of that Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt who is at present more of
      an acquaintance to us than either Sir Hugo or his nephew Daniel Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sir Hugo&rsquo;s youthful portrait with rolled collar and high cravat,
      Sir Thomas Lawrence had done justice to the agreeable alacrity of
      expression and sanguine temperament still to be seen in the original, but
      had done something more than justice in slightly lengthening the nose,
      which was in reality shorter than might have been expected in a Mallinger.
      Happily the appropriate nose of the family reappeared in his younger
      brother, and was to be seen in all its refined regularity in his nephew
      Mallinger Grandcourt. But in the nephew Daniel Deronda the family faces of
      various types, seen on the walls of the gallery, found no reflex. Still he
      was handsomer than any of them, and when he was thirteen might have served
      as model for any painter who wanted to image the most memorable of boys:
      you could hardly have seen his face thoroughly meeting yours without
      believing that human creatures had done nobly in times past, and might do
      more nobly in time to come. The finest childlike faces have this
      consecrating power, and make us shudder anew at all the grossness and
      basely-wrought griefs of the world, lest they should enter here and
      defile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment on the grass among the rose-petals, Daniel Deronda was
      making a first acquaintance with those griefs. A new idea had entered his
      mind, and was beginning to change the aspect of his habitual feelings as
      happy careless voyagers are changed with the sky suddenly threatened and
      the thought of danger arises. He sat perfectly still with his back to the
      tutor, while his face expressed rapid inward transition. The deep blush,
      which had come when he first started up, gradually subsided; but his
      features kept that indescribable look of subdued activity which often
      accompanies a new mental survey of familiar facts. He had not lived with
      other boys, and his mind showed the same blending of child&rsquo;s
      ignorance with surprising knowledge which is oftener seen in bright girls.
      Having read Shakespeare as well as a great deal of history, he could have
      talked with the wisdom of a bookish child about men who were born out of
      wedlock and were held unfortunate in consequence, being under
      disadvantages which required them to be a sort of heroes if they were to
      work themselves up to an equal standing with their legally born brothers.
      But he had never brought such knowledge into any association with his own
      lot, which had been too easy for him ever to think about it&mdash;until
      this moment when there had darted into his mind with the magic of quick
      comparison, the possibility that here was the secret of his own birth, and
      that the man whom he called uncle was really his father. Some children,
      even younger than Daniel, have known the first arrival of care, like an
      ominous irremovable guest in their tender lives, on the discovery that
      their parents, whom they had imagined able to buy everything, were poor
      and in hard money troubles. Daniel felt the presence of a new guest who
      seemed to come with an enigmatic veiled face, and to carry
      dimly-conjectured, dreaded revelations. The ardor which he had given to
      the imaginary world in his books suddenly rushed toward his own history
      and spent its pictorial energy there, explaining what he knew,
      representing the unknown. The uncle whom he loved very dearly took the
      aspect of a father who held secrets about him&mdash;who had done him a
      wrong&mdash;yes, a wrong: and what had become of his mother, for whom he
      must have been taken away?&mdash;Secrets about which he, Daniel, could
      never inquire; for to speak or to be spoken to about these new thoughts
      seemed like falling flakes of fire to his imagination. Those who have
      known an impassioned childhood will understand this dread of utterance
      about any shame connected with their parents. The impetuous advent of new
      images took possession of him with the force of fact for the first time
      told, and left him no immediate power for the reflection that he might be
      trembling at a fiction of his own. The terrible sense of collision between
      a strong rush of feeling and the dread of its betrayal, found relief at
      length in big slow tears, which fell without restraint until the voice of
      Mr. Fraser was heard saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daniel, do you see that you are sitting on the bent pages of your
      book?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel immediately moved the book without turning round, and after holding
      it before him for an instant, rose with it and walked away into the open
      grounds, where he could dry his tears unobserved. The first shock of
      suggestion past, he could remember that he had no certainty how things
      really had been, and that he had been making conjectures about his own
      history, as he had often made stories about Pericles or Columbus, just to
      fill up the blanks before they became famous. Only there came back certain
      facts which had an obstinate reality, almost like the fragments of a
      bridge, telling you unmistakably how the arches lay. And again there came
      a mood in which his conjectures seemed like a doubt of religion, to be
      banished as an offense, and a mean prying after what he was not meant to
      know; for there was hardly a delicacy of feeling this lad was not capable
      of. But the summing-up of all his fluctuating experience at this epoch
      was, that a secret impression had come to him which had given him
      something like a new sense in relation to all the elements of his life.
      And the idea that others probably knew things concerning which they did
      not choose to mention, set up in him a premature reserve which helped to
      intensify his inward experience. His ears open now to words which before
      that July day would have passed by him unnoted; and round every trivial
      incident which imagination could connect with his suspicions, a
      newly-roused set of feelings were ready to cluster themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      One such incident a month later wrought itself deeply into his life.
      Daniel had not only one of those thrilling boy voices which seem to bring
      an idyllic heaven and earth before our eyes, but a fine musical instinct,
      and had early made out accompaniments for himself on the piano, while he
      sang from memory. Since then he had had some teaching, and Sir Hugo, who
      delighted in the boy, used to ask for his music in the presence of guests.
      One morning after he had been singing &ldquo;Sweet Echo&rdquo; before a
      small party of gentlemen whom the rain had kept in the house, the baronet,
      passing from a smiling remark to his next neighbor said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, Dan!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy came forward with unusual reluctance. He wore an embroidered
      holland blouse which set off the rich coloring of his head and throat, and
      the resistant gravity about his mouth and eyes as he was being smiled
      upon, made their beauty the more impressive. Every one was admiring him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to being a great singer? Should you like to be
      adored by the world and take the house by storm, like Mario and Tamberlik?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel reddened instantaneously, but there was a just perceptible interval
      before he answered with angry decision,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I should hate it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well!&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, with surprised kindliness
      intended to be soothing. But Daniel turned away quickly, left the room,
      and going to his own chamber threw himself on the broad window-sill, which
      was a favorite retreat of his when he had nothing particular to do. Here
      he could see the rain gradually subsiding with gleams through the parting
      clouds which lit up a great reach of the park, where the old oaks stood
      apart from each other, and the bordering wood was pierced with a green
      glade which met the eastern sky. This was a scene which had always been
      part of his home&mdash;part of the dignified ease which had been a matter
      of course in his life. And his ardent clinging nature had appropriated it
      all with affection. He knew a great deal of what it was to be a gentleman
      by inheritance, and without thinking much about himself&mdash;for he was a
      boy of active perceptions and easily forgot his own existence in that of
      Robert Bruce&mdash;he had never supposed that he could be shut out from
      such a lot, or have a very different part in the world from that of the
      uncle who petted him. It is possible (though not greatly believed in at
      present) to be fond of poverty and take it for a bride, to prefer scoured
      deal, red quarries and whitewash for one&rsquo;s private surroundings, to
      delight in no splendor but what has open doors for the whole nation, and
      to glory in having no privileges except such as nature insists on; and
      noblemen have been known to run away from elaborate ease and the option of
      idleness, that they might bind themselves for small pay to hard-handed
      labor. But Daniel&rsquo;s tastes were altogether in keeping with his
      nurture: his disposition was one in which everyday scenes and habits beget
      not <i>ennui</i> or rebellion, but delight, affection, aptitudes; and now
      the lad had been stung to the quick by the idea that his uncle&mdash;perhaps
      his father&mdash;thought of a career for him which was totally unlike his
      own, and which he knew very well was not thought of among possible
      destinations for the sons of English gentlemen. He had often stayed in
      London with Sir Hugo, who to indulge the boy&rsquo;s ear had carried him
      to the opera to hear the great tenors, so that the image of a singer
      taking the house by storm was very vivid to him; but now, spite of his
      musical gift, he set himself bitterly against the notion of being dressed
      up to sing before all those fine people, who would not care about him
      except as a wonderful toy. That Sir Hugo should have thought of him in
      that position for a moment, seemed to Daniel an unmistakable proof that
      there was something about his birth which threw him out from the class of
      gentlemen to which the baronet belonged. Would it ever be mentioned to
      him? Would the time come when his uncle would tell him everything? He
      shrank from the prospect: in his imagination he preferred ignorance. If
      his father had been wicked&mdash;Daniel inwardly used strong words, for he
      was feeling the injury done him as a maimed boy feels the crushed limb
      which for others is merely reckoned in an average of accidents&mdash;if
      his father had done any wrong, he wished it might never be spoken of to
      him: it was already a cutting thought that such knowledge might be in
      other minds. Was it in Mr. Fraser&rsquo;s? probably not, else he would not
      have spoken in that way about the pope&rsquo;s nephews. Daniel fancied, as
      older people do, that every one else&rsquo;s consciousness was as active
      as his own on a matter which was vital to him. Did Turvey the valet know?&mdash;and
      old Mrs. French the housekeeper?&mdash;and Banks the bailiff, with whom he
      had ridden about the farms on his pony?&mdash;And now there came back the
      recollection of a day some years before when he was drinking Mrs. Banks&rsquo;s
      whey, and Banks said to his wife with a wink and a cunning laugh, &ldquo;He
      features the mother, eh?&rdquo; At that time little Daniel had merely
      thought that Banks made a silly face, as the common farming men often did,
      laughing at what was not laughable; and he rather resented being winked at
      and talked of as if he did not understand everything. But now that small
      incident became information: it was to be reasoned on. How could he be
      like his mother and not like his father? His mother must have been a
      Mallinger, if Sir Hugo were his uncle. But no! His father might have been
      Sir Hugo&rsquo;s brother and have changed his name, as Mr. Henleigh
      Mallinger did when he married Miss Grandcourt. But then, why had he never
      heard Sir Hugo speak of his brother Deronda, as he spoke of his brother
      Grandcourt? Daniel had never before cared about the family tree&mdash;only
      about that ancestor who had killed three Saracens in one encounter. But
      now his mind turned to a cabinet of estate-maps in the library, where he
      had once seen an illuminated parchment hanging out, that Sir Hugo said was
      the family tree. The phrase was new and odd to him&mdash;he was a little
      fellow then&mdash;hardly more than half his present age&mdash;and he gave
      it no precise meaning. He knew more now and wished that he could examine
      that parchment. He imagined that the cabinet was always locked, and longed
      to try it. But here he checked himself. He might be seen: and he would
      never bring himself near even a silent admission of the sore that had
      opened in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in such experiences of a boy or girlhood, while elders are debating
      whether most education lies in science or literature, that the main lines
      of character are often laid down. If Daniel had been of a less ardently
      affectionate nature, the reserve about himself and the supposition that
      others had something to his disadvantage in their minds, might have turned
      into a hard, proud antagonism. But inborn lovingness was strong enough to
      keep itself level with resentment. There was hardly any creature in his
      habitual world that he was not fond of; teasing them occasionally, of
      course&mdash;all except his uncle, or &ldquo;Nunc,&rdquo; as Sir Hugo had
      taught him to say; for the baronet was the reverse of a strait-laced man,
      and left his dignity to take care of itself. Him Daniel loved in that
      deep-rooted filial way which makes children always the happier for being
      in the same room with father or mother, though their occupations may be
      quite apart. Sir Hugo&rsquo;s watch-chain and seals, his handwriting, his
      mode of smoking and of talking to his dogs and horses, had all a rightness
      and charm about them to the boy which went along with the happiness of
      morning and breakfast time. That Sir Hugo had always been a Whig, made
      Tories and Radicals equally opponents of the truest and best; and the
      books he had written were all seen under the same consecration of loving
      belief which differenced what was his from what was not his, in spite of
      general resemblance. Those writings were various, from volumes of travel
      in the brilliant style, to articles on things in general, and pamphlets on
      political crises; but to Daniel they were alike in having an
      unquestionable rightness by which other people&rsquo;s information could
      be tested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who cannot imagine the bitterness of a first suspicion that something in
      this object of complete love was <i>not</i> quite right? Children demand
      that their heroes should be fleckless, and easily believe them so: perhaps
      a first discovery to the contrary is hardly a less revolutionary shock to
      a passionate child than the threatened downfall of habitual beliefs which
      makes the world seem to totter for us in maturer life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But some time after this renewal of Daniel&rsquo;s agitation it appeared
      that Sir Hugo must have been making a merely playful experiment in his
      question about the singing. He sent for Daniel into the library, and
      looking up from his writing as the boy entered threw himself sideways in
      his armchair. &ldquo;Ah, Dan!&rdquo; he said kindly, drawing one of the
      old embroidered stools close to him. &ldquo;Come and sit down here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel obeyed, and Sir Hugo put a gentle hand on his shoulder, looking at
      him affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, my boy? Have you heard anything that has put you out of
      spirits lately?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel was determined not to let the tears come, but he could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All changes are painful when people have been happy, you know,&rdquo;
      said Sir Hugo, lifting his hand from the boy&rsquo;s shoulder to his dark
      curls and rubbing them gently. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be educated exactly
      as I wish you to be without our parting. And I think you will find a great
      deal to like at school.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not what Daniel expected, and was so far a relief, which gave him
      spirit to answer,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to go to school?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I mean you to go to Eton. I wish you to have the education of
      an English gentleman; and for that it is necessary that you should go to a
      public school in preparation for the university: Cambridge I mean you to
      go to; it was my own university.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel&rsquo;s color came and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, Sirrah?&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to be a gentleman,&rdquo; said Daniel, with firm
      distinctness, &ldquo;and go to school, if that is what a gentleman&rsquo;s
      son must do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Hugo watched him silently for a few moments, thinking he understood
      now why the lad had seemed angry at the notion of becoming a singer. Then
      he said tenderly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you won&rsquo;t mind about leaving your old Nunc?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shall,&rdquo; said Daniel, clasping Sir Hugo&rsquo;s
      caressing arm with both his hands. &ldquo;But sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I come
      home and be with you in the holidays?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, generally,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo. &ldquo;But now I mean you
      to go at once to a new tutor, to break the change for you before you go to
      Eton.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After this interview Daniel&rsquo;s spirit rose again. He was meant to be
      a gentleman, and in some unaccountable way it might be that his
      conjectures were all wrong. The very keenness of the lad taught him to
      find comfort in his ignorance. While he was busying his mind in the
      construction of possibilities, it became plain to him that there must be
      possibilities of which he knew nothing. He left off brooding, young joy
      and the spirit of adventure not being easily quenched within him, and in
      the interval before his going away he sang about the house, danced among
      the old servants, making them parting gifts, and insisted many times to
      the groom on the care that was to be taken of the black pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I shall know much less than the other boys, Mr.
      Fraser?&rdquo; said Daniel. It was his bent to think that every stranger
      would be surprised at his ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are dunces to be found everywhere,&rdquo; said the judicious
      Fraser. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not be the biggest; but you&rsquo;ve not the
      makings of a Porson in you, or a Leibnitz either.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be a Porson or a Leibnitz,&rdquo; said
      Daniel. &ldquo;I would rather be a greater leader, like Pericles or
      Washington.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay; you&rsquo;ve a notion they did with little parsing, and
      less algebra,&rdquo; said Fraser. But in reality he thought his pupil a
      remarkable lad, to whom one thing was as easy as another, if he had only a
      mind to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things went on very well with Daniel in his new world, except that a boy
      with whom he was at once inclined to strike up a close friendship talked
      to him a great deal about his home and parents, and seemed to expect a
      like expansiveness in return. Daniel immediately shrank into reserve, and
      this experience remained a check on his naturally strong bent toward the
      formation of intimate friendship. Every one, his tutor included, set him
      down as a reserved boy, though he was so good-humored and unassuming, as
      well as quick, both at study and sport, that nobody called his reserve
      disagreeable. Certainly his face had a great deal to do with that
      favorable interpretation; but in this instance the beauty of the closed
      lips told no falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      A surprise that came to him before his first vacation strengthened the
      silent consciousness of a grief within, which might be compared in some
      ways with Byron&rsquo;s susceptibility about his deformed foot. Sir Hugo
      wrote word that he was married to Miss Raymond, a sweet lady, whom Daniel
      must remember having seen. The event would make no difference about his
      spending the vacation at the Abbey; he would find Lady Mallinger a new
      friend whom he would be sure to love&mdash;and much more to the usual
      effect when a man, having done something agreeable to himself, is disposed
      to congratulate others on his own good fortune, and the deducible
      satisfactoriness of events in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let Sir Hugo be partly excused until the grounds of his action can be more
      fully known. The mistakes in his behavior to Deronda were due to that
      dullness toward what may be going on in other minds, especially the minds
      of children, which is among the commonest deficiencies, even in
      good-natured men like him, when life has been generally easy to
      themselves, and their energies have been quietly spent in feeling
      gratified. No one was better aware than he that Daniel was generally
      suspected to be his own son. But he was pleased with that suspicion; and
      his imagination had never once been troubled with the way in which the boy
      himself might be affected, either then or in the future, by the enigmatic
      aspect of his circumstances. He was as fond of him as could be, and meant
      the best by him. And, considering the lightness with which the preparation
      of young lives seem to lie on respectable consciences, Sir Hugo Mallinger
      can hardly be held open to exceptional reproach. He had been a bachelor
      till he was five-and-forty, had always been regarded as a fascinating man
      of elegant tastes; what could be more natural, even according to the index
      of language, than that he should have a beautiful boy like the little
      Deronda to take care of? The mother might even, perhaps, be in the great
      world&mdash;met with in Sir Hugo&rsquo;s residence abroad. The only person
      to feel any objection was the boy himself, who could not have been
      consulted. And the boy&rsquo;s objections had never been dreamed of by
      anybody but himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time Deronda was ready to go to Cambridge, Lady Mallinger had
      already three daughters&mdash;charming babies, all three, but whose sex
      was announced as a melancholy alternative, the offspring desired being a
      son; if Sir Hugo had no son the succession must go to his nephew,
      Mallinger Grandcourt. Daniel no longer held a wavering opinion about his
      own birth. His fuller knowledge had tended to convince him that Sir Hugo
      was his father, and he conceived that the baronet, since he never
      approached a communication on the subject, wished him to have a tacit
      understanding of the fact, and to accept in silence what would be
      generally considered more than the due love and nurture. Sir Hugo&rsquo;s
      marriage might certainly have been felt as a new ground of resentment by
      some youths in Deronda&rsquo;s position, and the timid Lady Mallinger with
      her fast-coming little ones might have been images to scowl at, as likely
      to divert much that was disposable in the feelings and possessions of the
      baronet from one who felt his own claim to be prior. But hatred of
      innocent human obstacles was a form of moral stupidity not in Deronda&rsquo;s
      grain; even the indignation which had long mingled itself with his
      affection for Sir Hugo took the quality of pain rather than of temper; and
      as his mind ripened to the idea of tolerance toward error, he habitually
      liked the idea with his own silent grievances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense of an entailed disadvantage&mdash;the deformed foot doubtfully
      hidden by the shoe, makes a restlessly active spiritual yeast, and easily
      turns a self-centered, unloving nature into an Ishmaelite. But in the
      rarer sort, who presently see their own frustrated claim as one among a
      myriad, the inexorable sorrow takes the form of fellowship and makes the
      imagination tender. Deronda&rsquo;s early-weakened susceptibility, charged
      at first with ready indignation and resistant pride, had raised in him a
      premature reflection on certain questions of life; it had given a bias to
      his conscience, a sympathy with certain ills, and a tension of resolve in
      certain directions, who marked him off from other youths much more than
      any talents he possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day near the end of the long vacation, when he had been making a tour
      in the Rhineland with his Eton tutor, and was come for a farewell stay at
      the Abbey before going to Cambridge, he said to Sir Hugo,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you intend me to be, sir?&rdquo; They were in the library,
      and it was the fresh morning. Sir Hugo had called him in to read a letter
      from a Cambridge Don who was to be interested in him; and since the
      baronet wore an air at once business-like and leisurely, the moment seemed
      propitious for entering on a grave subject which had never yet been
      thoroughly discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever your inclination leads you to, my boy. I thought it right
      to give you the option of the army, but you shut the door on that, and I
      was glad. I don&rsquo;t expect you to choose just yet&mdash;by-and-by,
      when you have looked about you a little more and tried your mettle among
      older men. The university has a good wide opening into the forum. There
      are prizes to be won, and a bit of good fortune often gives the turn to a
      man&rsquo;s taste. From what I see and hear, I should think you can take
      up anything you like. You are in the deeper water with your classics than
      I ever got into, and if you are rather sick of that swimming, Cambridge is
      the place where you can go into mathematics with a will, and disport
      yourself on the dry sand as much as you like. I floundered along like a
      carp.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose money will make some difference, sir,&rdquo; said Daniel
      blushing. &ldquo;I shall have to keep myself by-and-by.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly. I recommend you not to be extravagant&mdash;yes, yes,
      I know&mdash;you are not inclined to that&mdash;but you need not take up
      anything against the grain. You will have a bachelor&rsquo;s income&mdash;enough
      for you to look about with. Perhaps I had better tell you that you may
      consider yourself secure of seven hundred a year. You might make yourself
      a barrister&mdash;be a writer&mdash;take up politics. I confess that is
      what would please me best. I should like to have you at my elbow and
      pulling with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda looked embarrassed. He felt that he ought to make some sign of
      gratitude, but other feelings clogged his tongue. A moment was passing by
      in which a question about his birth was throbbing within him, and yet it
      seemed more impossible than ever that the question should find vent&mdash;more
      impossible than ever that he could hear certain things from Sir Hugo&rsquo;s
      lips. The liberal way in which he was dealt with was the more striking
      because the baronet had of late cared particularly for money, and for
      making the utmost of his life-interest in the estate by way of providing
      for his daughters; and as all this flashed through Daniel&rsquo;s mind it
      was momentarily within his imagination that the provision for him might
      come in some way from his mother. But such vaporous conjecture passed away
      as quickly as it came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Hugo appeared not to notice anything peculiar in Daniel&rsquo;s
      manner, and presently went on with his usual chatty liveliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you have done some good reading outside your classics,
      and have got a grip of French and German. The truth is, unless a man can
      get the prestige and income of a Don and write donnish books, it&rsquo;s
      hardly worth while for him to make a Greek and Latin machine of himself
      and be able to spin you out pages of the Greek dramatists at any verse you&rsquo;ll
      give him as a cue. That&rsquo;s all very fine, but in practical life
      nobody does give you the cue for pages of Greek. In fact, it&rsquo;s a
      nicety of conversation which I would have you attend to&mdash;much
      quotation of any sort, even in English is bad. It tends to choke ordinary
      remark. One couldn&rsquo;t carry on life comfortably without a little
      blindness to the fact that everything had been said better than we can put
      it ourselves. But talking of Dons, I have seen Dons make a capital figure
      in society; and occasionally he can shoot you down a cart-load of learning
      in the right place, which will tell in politics. Such men are wanted; and
      if you have any turn for being a Don, I say nothing against it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s not much chance of that. Quicksett and Puller
      are both stronger than I am. I hope you will not be much disappointed if I
      don&rsquo;t come out with high honors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. I should like you to do yourself credit, but for God&rsquo;s
      sake don&rsquo;t come out as a superior expensive kind of idiot, like
      young Brecon, who got a Double First, and has been learning to knit braces
      ever since. What I wish you to get is a passport in life. I don&rsquo;t go
      against our university system: we want a little disinterested culture to
      make head against cotton and capital, especially in the House. My Greek
      has all evaporated; if I had to construe a verse on a sudden, I should get
      an apoplectic fit. But it formed my taste. I dare say my English is the
      better for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On this point Daniel kept a respectful silence. The enthusiastic belief in
      Sir Hugo&rsquo;s writings as a standard, and in the Whigs as the chosen
      race among politicians, had gradually vanished along with the seraphic boy&rsquo;s
      face. He had not been the hardest of workers at Eton. Though some kinds of
      study and reading came as easily as boating to him, he was not of the
      material that usually makes the first-rate Eton scholar. There had sprung
      up in him a meditative yearning after wide knowledge which is likely
      always to abate ardor in the fight for prize acquirement in narrow tracks.
      Happily he was modest, and took any second-rateness in himself simply as a
      fact, not as a marvel necessarily to be accounted for by a superiority.
      Still, Mr. Fraser&rsquo;s high opinion of the lad had not been altogether
      belied by the youth: Daniel had the stamp of rarity in a subdued fervor of
      sympathy, an activity of imagination on behalf of others which did not
      show itself effusively, but was continually seen in acts of
      considerateness that struck his companions as moral eccentricity. &ldquo;Deronda
      would have been first-rate if he had had more ambition,&rdquo; was a
      frequent remark about him. But how could a fellow push his way properly
      when he objected to swop for his own advantage, knocked under by choice
      when he was within an inch of victory, and, unlike the great Clive, would
      rather be the calf than the butcher? It was a mistake, however, to suppose
      that Deronda had not his share of ambition. We know he had suffered keenly
      from the belief that there was a tinge of dishonor in his lot; but there
      are some cases, and his was one of them, in which the sense of injury
      breeds&mdash;not the will to inflict injuries and climb over them as a
      ladder, but, a hatred of all injury. He had his flashes of fierceness and
      could hit out upon occasion, but the occasions were not always what might
      have been expected. For in what related to himself his resentful impulses
      had been early checked by a mastering affectionateness. Love has a habit
      of saying &ldquo;Never mind&rdquo; to angry self, who, sitting down for
      the nonce in the lower place, by-and-by gets used to it. So it was that as
      Deronda approached manhood his feeling for Sir Hugo, while it was getting
      more and more mixed with criticism, was gaining in that sort of allowance
      which reconciles criticism with tenderness. The dear old beautiful home
      and everything within it, Lady Mallinger and her little ones included,
      were consecrated for the youth as they had been for the boy&mdash;only
      with a certain difference of light on the objects. The altarpiece was no
      longer miraculously perfect, painted under infallible guidance, but the
      human hand discerned in the work was appealing to a reverent tenderness
      safer from the gusts of discovery. Certainly Deronda&rsquo;s ambition,
      even in his spring-time, lay exceptionally aloof from conspicuous, vulgar
      triumph, and from other ugly forms of boyish energy; perhaps because he
      was early impassioned by ideas, and burned his fire on those heights. One
      may spend a good deal of energy in disliking and resisting what others
      pursue, and a boy who is fond of somebody else&rsquo;s pencil-case may not
      be more energetic than another who is fond of giving his own pencil-case
      away. Still it was not Deronda&rsquo;s disposition to escape from ugly
      scenes; he was more inclined to sit through them and take care of the
      fellow least able to take care of himself. It had helped to make him
      popular that he was sometimes a little compromised by this apparent
      comradeship. For a meditative interest in learning how human miseries are
      wrought&mdash;as precocious in him as another sort of genius in the poet
      who writes a Queen Mab at nineteen&mdash;was so infused with kindliness
      that it easily passed for comradeship. Enough. In many of our neighbors&rsquo;
      lives there is much not only of error and lapse, but of a certain
      exquisite goodness which can never be written or even spoken&mdash;only
      divined by each of us, according to the inward instruction of our own
      privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impression he made at Cambridge corresponded to his position at Eton.
      Every one interested in him agreed that he might have taken a high place
      if his motives had been of a more pushing sort, and if he had not, instead
      of regarding studies as instruments of success, hampered himself with the
      notion that they were to feed motive and opinion&mdash;a notion which set
      him criticising methods and arguing against his freight and harness when
      he should have been using all his might to pull. In the beginning his work
      at the university had a new zest for him: indifferent to the continuation
      of Eton classical drill, he applied himself vigorously to mathematics, for
      which he had shown an early aptitude under Mr. Fraser, and he had the
      delight of feeling his strength in a comparatively fresh exercise of
      thought. That delight, and the favorable opinion of his tutor, determined
      him to try for a mathematical scholarship in the Easter of his second
      year: he wished to gratify Sir Hugo by some achievement, and the study of
      the higher mathematics, having the growing fascination inherent in all
      thinking which demands intensity, was making him a more exclusive worker
      than he had been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here came the old check which had been growing with his growth. He
      found the inward bent toward comprehension and thoroughness diverging more
      and more from the track marked out by the standards of examination: he
      felt a heightening discontent with the wearing futility and enfeebling
      strain of a demand for excessive retention and dexterity without any
      insight into the principles which form the vital connections of knowledge.
      (Deronda&rsquo;s undergraduateship occurred fifteen years ago, when the
      perfection of our university methods was not yet indisputable.) In hours
      when his dissatisfaction was strong upon him he reproached himself for
      having been attracted by the conventional advantage of belonging to an
      English university, and was tempted toward the project of asking Sir Hugo
      to let him quit Cambridge and pursue a more independent line of study
      abroad. The germs of this inclination had been already stirring in his
      boyish love of universal history, which made him want to be at home in
      foreign countries, and follow in imagination the traveling students of the
      middle ages. He longed now to have the sort of apprenticeship to life
      which would not shape him too definitely, and rob him of the choice that
      might come from a free growth. One sees that Deronda&rsquo;s demerits were
      likely to be on the side of reflective hesitation, and this tendency was
      encouraged by his position; there was no need for him to get an immediate
      income, or to fit himself in haste for a profession; and his sensibility
      to the half-known facts of his parentage made him an excuse for lingering
      longer than others in a state of social neutrality. Other men, he inwardly
      said, had a more definite place and duties. But the project which
      flattered his inclination might not have gone beyond the stage of
      ineffective brooding, if certain circumstances had not quickened it into
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances arose out of an enthusiastic friendship which extended
      into his after-life. Of the same year with himself, and occupying small
      rooms close to his, was a youth who had come as an exhibitioner from
      Christ&rsquo;s Hospital, and had eccentricities enough for a Charles Lamb.
      Only to look at his pinched features and blonde hair hanging over his
      collar reminded one of pale quaint heads by early German painters; and
      when this faint coloring was lit up by a joke, there came sudden creases
      about the mouth and eyes which might have been moulded by the soul of an
      aged humorist. His father, an engraver of some distinction, had been dead
      eleven years, and his mother had three girls to educate and maintain on a
      meagre annuity. Hans Meyrick&mdash;he had been daringly christened after
      Holbein&mdash;felt himself the pillar, or rather the knotted and twisted
      trunk, round which these feeble climbing plants must cling. There was no
      want of ability or of honest well-meaning affection to make the prop
      trustworthy: the ease and quickness with which he studied might serve him
      to win prizes at Cambridge, as he had done among the Blue Coats, in spite
      of irregularities. The only danger was, that the incalculable tendencies
      in him might be fatally timed, and that his good intentions might be
      frustrated by some act which was not due to habit but to capricious,
      scattered impulses. He could not be said to have any one bad habit; yet at
      longer or shorter intervals he had fits of impish recklessness, and did
      things that would have made the worst habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hans in his right mind, however, was a lovable creature, and in Deronda he
      had happened to find a friend who was likely to stand by him with the more
      constancy, from compassion for these brief aberrations that might bring a
      long repentance. Hans, indeed, shared Deronda&rsquo;s rooms nearly as much
      as he used his own: to Deronda he poured himself out on his studies, his
      affairs, his hopes; the poverty of his home, and his love for the
      creatures there; the itching of his fingers to draw, and his determination
      to fight it away for the sake of getting some sort of a plum that he might
      divide with his mother and the girls. He wanted no confidence in return,
      but seemed to take Deronda as an Olympian who needed nothing&mdash;an
      egotism in friendship which is common enough with mercurial, expansive
      natures. Deronda was content, and gave Meyrick all the interest he
      claimed, getting at last a brotherly anxiety about him, looking after him
      in his erratic moments, and contriving by adroitly delicate devices not
      only to make up for his friend&rsquo;s lack of pence, but to save him from
      threatening chances. Such friendship easily becomes tender: the one
      spreads strong sheltering wings that delight in spreading, the other gets
      the warm protection which is also a delight. Meyrick was going in for a
      classical scholarship, and his success, in various ways momentous, was the
      more probable from the steadying influence of Deronda&rsquo;s friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      But an imprudence of Meyrick&rsquo;s, committed at the beginning of the
      autumn term, threatened to disappoint his hopes. With his usual
      alternation between unnecessary expense and self-privation, he had given
      too much money for an old engraving which fascinated him, and to make up
      for it, had come from London in a third-class carriage with his eyes
      exposed to a bitter wind and any irritating particles the wind might drive
      before it. The consequence was a severe inflammation of the eyes, which
      for some time hung over him the threat of a lasting injury. This crushing
      trouble called out all Deronda&rsquo;s readiness to devote himself, and he
      made every other occupation secondary to that of being companion and eyes
      to Hans, working with him and for him at his classics, that if possible
      his chance of the classical scholarship might be saved. Hans, to keep the
      knowledge of his suffering from his mother and sisters, alleged his work
      as a reason for passing the Christmas at Cambridge, and his friend stayed
      up with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Deronda relaxed his hold on his mathematics, and Hans,
      reflecting on this, at length said: &ldquo;Old fellow, while you are
      hoisting me you are risking yourself. With your mathematical cram one may
      be like Moses or Mohammed or somebody of that sort who had to cram, and
      forgot in one day what it had taken him forty to learn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda would not admit that he cared about the risk, and he had really
      been beguiled into a little indifference by double sympathy: he was very
      anxious that Hans should not miss the much-needed scholarship, and he felt
      a revival of interest in the old studies. Still, when Hans, rather late in
      the day, got able to use his own eyes, Deronda had tenacity enough to try
      hard and recover his lost ground. He failed, however; but he had the
      satisfaction of seeing Meyrick win.
    </p>
    <p>
      Success, as a sort of beginning that urged completion, might have
      reconciled Deronda to his university course; but the emptiness of all
      things, from politics to pastimes, is never so striking to us as when we
      fail in them. The loss of the personal triumph had no severity for him,
      but the sense of having spent his time ineffectively in a mode of working
      which had been against the grain, gave him a distaste for any renewal of
      the process, which turned his imagined project of quitting Cambridge into
      a serious intention. In speaking of his intention to Meyrick he made it
      appear that he was glad of the turn events had taken&mdash;glad to have
      the balance dip decidedly, and feel freed from his hesitations; but he
      observed that he must of course submit to any strong objection on the part
      of Sir Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meyrick&rsquo;s joy and gratitude were disturbed by much uneasiness. He
      believed in Deronda&rsquo;s alleged preference, but he felt keenly that in
      serving him Daniel had placed himself at a disadvantage in Sir Hugo&rsquo;s
      opinion, and he said mournfully, &ldquo;If you had got the scholarship,
      Sir Hugo would have thought that you asked to leave us with a better
      grace. You have spoiled your luck for my sake, and I can do nothing to
      amend it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you can; you are to be a first-rate fellow. I call that a
      first-rate investment of my luck.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, confound it! You save an ugly mongrel from drowning, and expect
      him to cut a fine figure. The poets have made tragedies enough about
      signing one&rsquo;s self over to wickedness for the sake of getting
      something plummy; I shall write a tragedy of a fellow who signed himself
      over to be good, and was uncomfortable ever after.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hans lost no time in secretly writing the history of the affair to Sir
      Hugo, making it plain that but for Deronda&rsquo;s generous devotion he
      could hardly have failed to win the prize he had been working for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two friends went up to town together: Meyrick to rejoice with his
      mother and the girls in their little home at Chelsea; Deronda to carry out
      the less easy task of opening his mind to Sir Hugo. He relied a little on
      the baronet&rsquo;s general tolerance of eccentricities, but he expected
      more opposition than he met with. He was received with even warmer
      kindness than usual, the failure was passed over lightly, and when he
      detailed his reasons for wishing to quit the university and go to study
      abroad, Sir Hugo sat for some time in a silence which was rather
      meditative than surprised. At last he said, looking at Daniel with
      examination, &ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t want to be an Englishman to the
      backbone after all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to be an Englishman, but I want to understand other points
      of view. And I want to get rid of a merely English attitude in studies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see; you don&rsquo;t want to be turned out in the same mould as
      every other youngster. And I have nothing to say against your doffing some
      of our national prejudices. I feel the better myself for having spent a
      good deal of my time abroad. But, for God&rsquo;s sake, keep an English
      cut, and don&rsquo;t become indifferent to bad tobacco! And, my dear boy,
      it is good to be unselfish and generous; but don&rsquo;t carry that too
      far. It will not do to give yourself to be melted down for the benefit of
      the tallow-trade; you must know where to find yourself. However, I shall
      put no veto on your going. Wait until I can get off Committee, and I&rsquo;ll
      run over with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So Deronda went according to his will. But not before he had spent some
      hours with Hans Meyrick, and been introduced to the mother and sisters in
      the Chelsea home. The shy girls watched and registered every look of their
      brother&rsquo;s friend, declared by Hans to have been the salvation of
      him, a fellow like nobody else, and, in fine, a brick. They so thoroughly
      accepted Deronda as an ideal, that when he was gone the youngest set to
      work, under the criticism of the two elder girls, to paint him as Prince
      Camaralzaman.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;This is truth the poet sings,
  That a sorrow&rsquo;s crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.&rdquo;
                                 &mdash;TENNYSON: <i>Locksley Hall</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      On a fine evening near the end of July, Deronda was rowing himself on the
      Thames. It was already a year or more since he had come back to England,
      with the understanding that his education was finished, and that he was
      somehow to take his place in English society; but though, in deference to
      Sir Hugo&rsquo;s wish, and to fence off idleness, he had begun to read
      law, this apparent decision had been without other result than to deepen
      the roots of indecision. His old love of boating had revived with the more
      force now that he was in town with the Mallingers, because he could
      nowhere else get the same still seclusion which the river gave him. He had
      a boat of his own at Putney, and whenever Sir Hugo did not want him, it
      was his chief holiday to row till past sunset and come in again with the
      stars. Not that he was in a sentimental stage; but he was in another sort
      of contemplative mood perhaps more common in the young men of our day&mdash;that
      of questioning whether it were worth while to take part in the battle of
      the world: I mean, of course, the young men in whom the unproductive labor
      of questioning is sustained by three or five per cent, on capital which
      somebody else has battled for. It puzzled Sir Hugo that one who made a
      splendid contrast with all that was sickly and puling should be hampered
      with ideas which, since they left an accomplished Whig like himself
      unobstructed, could be no better than spectral illusions; especially as
      Deronda set himself against authorship&mdash;a vocation which is
      understood to turn foolish thinking into funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rowing in his dark-blue shirt and skull-cap, his curls closely clipped,
      his mouth beset with abundant soft waves of beard, he bore only disguised
      traces of the seraphic boy &ldquo;trailing clouds of glory.&rdquo; Still,
      even one who had never seen him since his boyhood might have looked at him
      with slow recognition, due perhaps to the peculiarity of the gaze which
      Gwendolen chose to call &ldquo;dreadful,&rdquo; though it had really a
      very mild sort of scrutiny. The voice, sometimes audible in subdued
      snatches of song, had turned out merely a high baritone; indeed, only to
      look at his lithe, powerful frame and the firm gravity of his face would
      have been enough for an experienced guess that he had no rare and
      ravishing tenor such as nature reluctantly makes at some sacrifice. Look
      at his hands: they are not small and dimpled, with tapering fingers that
      seem to have only a deprecating touch: they are long, flexible,
      firmly-grasping hands, such as Titian has painted in a picture where he
      wanted to show the combination of refinement with force. And there is
      something of a likeness, too, between the faces belonging to the hands&mdash;in
      both the uniform pale-brown skin, the perpendicular brow, the calmly
      penetrating eyes. Not seraphic any longer: thoroughly terrestrial and
      manly; but still of a kind to raise belief in a human dignity which can
      afford to recognize poor relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such types meet us here and there among average conditions; in a workman,
      for example, whistling over a bit of measurement and lifting his eyes to
      answer our question about the road. And often the grand meanings of faces
      as well as of written words may lie chiefly in the impressions that happen
      just now to be of importance in relation to Deronda, rowing on the Thames
      in a very ordinary equipment for a young Englishman at leisure, and
      passing under Kew Bridge with no thought of an adventure in which his
      appearance was likely to play any part. In fact, he objected very strongly
      to the notion, which others had not allowed him to escape, that his
      appearance was of a kind to draw attention; and hints of this, intended to
      be complimentary, found an angry resonance in him, coming from mingled
      experiences, to which a clue has already been given. His own face in the
      glass had during many years associated for him with thoughts of some one
      whom he must be like&mdash;one about whose character and lot he
      continually wondered, and never dared to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the neighborhood of Kew Bridge, between six and seven o&rsquo;clock,
      the river was no solitude. Several persons were sauntering on the
      towing-path, and here and there a boat was plying. Deronda had been rowing
      fast to get over this spot, when, becoming aware of a great barge
      advancing toward him, he guided his boat aside, and rested on his oar
      within a couple of yards of the river-brink. He was all the while
      unconsciously continuing the low-toned chant which had haunted his throat
      all the way up the river&mdash;the gondolier&rsquo;s song in the <i>Otello</i>,
      where Rossini has worthily set to music the immortal words of Dante,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Nessun maggior dolore
  Che ricordarsi del tempo felice
  Nella miseria&rdquo;:
</pre>
    <p>
      [Footnote: Dante&rsquo;s words are best rendered by our own poet in the
      lines at the head of the chapter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      and, as he rested on his oar, the pianissimo fall of the melodic wail
      &ldquo;nella miseria&rdquo; was distinctly audible on the brink of the
      water. Three or four persons had paused at various spots to watch the
      barge passing the bridge, and doubtless included in their notice the young
      gentleman in the boat; but probably it was only to one ear that the low
      vocal sounds came with more significance than if they had been an
      insect-murmur amidst the sum of current noises. Deronda, awaiting the
      barge, now turning his head to the river-side, and saw at a few yards&rsquo;
      distant from him a figure which might have been an impersonation of the
      misery he was unconsciously giving voice to: a girl hardly more than
      eighteen, of low slim figure, with most delicate little face, her dark
      curls pushed behind her ears under a large black hat, a long woolen cloak
      over her shoulders. Her hands were hanging down clasped before her, and
      her eyes were fixed on the river with a look of immovable, statue-like
      despair. This strong arrest of his attention made him cease singing:
      apparently his voice had entered her inner world without her taking any
      note of whence it came, for when it suddenly ceased she changed her
      attitude slightly, and, looking round with a frightened glance, met
      Deronda&rsquo;s face. It was but a couple of moments, but that seemed a
      long while for two people to look straight at each other. Her look was
      something like that of a fawn or other gentle animal before it turns to
      run away: no blush, no special alarm, but only some timidity which yet
      could not hinder her from a long look before she turned. In fact, it
      seemed to Deronda that she was only half conscious of her surroundings:
      was she hungry, or was there some other cause of bewilderment? He felt an
      outleap of interest and compassion toward her; but the next instant she
      had turned and walked away to a neighboring bench under a tree. He had no
      right to linger and watch her: poorly-dressed, melancholy women are common
      sights; it was only the delicate beauty, picturesque lines and color of
      the image that was exceptional, and these conditions made it more markedly
      impossible that he should obtrude his interest upon her. He began to row
      away and was soon far up the river; but no other thoughts were busy enough
      quite to expel that pale image of unhappy girlhood. He fell again and
      again to speculating on the probable romance that lay behind that
      loneliness and look of desolation; then to smile at his own share in the
      prejudice that interesting faces must have interesting adventures; then to
      justify himself for feeling that sorrow was the more tragic when it befell
      delicate, childlike beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not have forgotten the look of misery if she had been ugly
      and vulgar,&rdquo; he said to himself. But there was no denying that the
      attractiveness of the image made it likelier to last. It was clear to him
      as an onyx cameo; the brown-black drapery, the white face with small,
      small features and dark, long-lashed eyes. His mind glanced over the
      girl-tragedies that are going on in the world, hidden, unheeded, as if
      they were but tragedies of the copse or hedgerow, where the helpless drag
      wounded wings forsakenly, and streak the shadowed moss with the red
      moment-hand of their own death. Deronda of late, in his solitary
      excursions, had been occupied chiefly with uncertainties about his own
      course; but those uncertainties, being much at their leisure, were wont to
      have such wide-sweeping connections with all life and history that the new
      image of helpless sorrow easily blent itself with what seemed to him the
      strong array of reasons why he should shrink from getting into that
      routine of the world which makes men apologize for all its wrong-doing,
      and take opinions as mere professional equipment&mdash;why he should not
      draw strongly at any thread in the hopelessly-entangled scheme of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      He used his oars little, satisfied to go with the tide and be taken back
      by it. It was his habit to indulge himself in that solemn passivity which
      easily comes with the lengthening shadows and mellow light, when thinking
      and desiring melt together imperceptibly, and what in other hours may have
      seemed argument takes the quality of passionate vision. By the time he had
      come back again with the tide past Richmond Bridge the sun was near
      setting: and the approach of his favorite hour&mdash;with its deepening
      stillness and darkening masses of tree and building between the double
      glow of the sky and the river&mdash;disposed him to linger as if they had
      been an unfinished strain of music. He looked out for a perfectly solitary
      spot where he could lodge his boat against the bank, and, throwing himself
      on his back with his head propped on the cushions, could watch out the
      light of sunset and the opening of that bead-roll which some oriental poet
      describes as God&rsquo;s call to the little stars, who each answer,
      &ldquo;Here am I.&rdquo; He chose a spot in the bend of the river just
      opposite Kew Gardens, where he had a great breadth of water before him
      reflecting the glory of the sky, while he himself was in shadow. He lay
      with his hands behind his head, propped on a level with the boat&rsquo;s
      edge, so that he could see all round him, but could not be seen by any one
      at a few yards&rsquo; distance; and for a long while he never turned his
      eyes from the view right in front of him. He was forgetting everything
      else in a half-speculative, half-involuntary identification of himself
      with the objects he was looking at, thinking how far it might be possible
      habitually to shift his centre till his own personality would be no less
      outside him than the landscape&mdash;when the sense of something moving on
      the bank opposite him where it was bordered by a line of willow bushes,
      made him turn his glance thitherward. In the first moment he had a darting
      presentiment about the moving figure; and now he could see the small face
      with the strange dying sunlight upon it. He feared to frighten her by a
      sudden movement, and watched her with motionless attention. She looked
      round, but seemed only to gather security from the apparent solitude, hid
      her hat among the willows, and immediately took off her woolen cloak.
      Presently she seated herself and deliberately dipped the cloak in the
      water, holding it there a little while, then taking it out with effort,
      rising from her seat as she did so. By this time Deronda felt sure that
      she meant to wrap the wet cloak round her as a drowning shroud; there was
      no longer time to hesitate about frightening her. He rose and seized his
      oar to ply across; happily her position lay a little below him. The poor
      thing, overcome with terror at this sign of discovery from the opposite
      bank, sank down on the brink again, holding her cloak half out of the
      water. She crouched and covered her face as if she kept a faint hope that
      she had not been seen, and that the boatman was accidentally coming toward
      her. But soon he was within brief space of her, steadying his boat against
      the bank, and speaking, but very gently,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. You are unhappy. Pray, trust me. Tell me
      what I can do to help you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head and looked up at him. His face now was toward the
      light, and she knew it again. But she did not speak for a few moments
      which were a renewal of their former gaze at each other. At last she said
      in a low sweet voice, with an accent so distinct that it suggested
      foreignness and yet was not foreign, &ldquo;I saw you before,&rdquo; and
      then added dreamily, after a like pause, &ldquo;nella miseria.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda, not understanding the connection of her thoughts, supposed that
      her mind was weakened by distress and hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was you, singing?&rdquo; she went on, hesitatingly&mdash;&ldquo;Nessun
      maggior dolore.&rdquo; The mere words themselves uttered in her sweet
      undertones seemed to give the melody to Deronda&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he said, understanding now, &ldquo;I am often
      singing them. But I fear you will injure yourself staying here. Pray let
      me take you in my boat to some place of safety. And that wet cloak&mdash;let
      me take it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not attempt to take it without her leave, dreading lest he should
      scare her. Even at his words, he fancied that she shrank and clutched the
      cloak more tenaciously. But her eyes were fixed on him with a question in
      them as she said, &ldquo;You look good. Perhaps it is God&rsquo;s command.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do trust me. Let me help you. I will die before I will let any harm
      come to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose from her sitting posture, first dragging the saturated cloak and
      then letting it fall on the ground&mdash;it was too heavy for her tired
      arms. Her little woman&rsquo;s figure as she laid her delicate chilled
      hands together one over the other against her waist, and went a step
      backward while she leaned her head forward as if not to lose sight of his
      face, was unspeakably touching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; the words escaped Deronda in a tone so low and
      solemn that they seemed like a prayer become unconsciously vocal. The
      agitating impression this forsaken girl was making on him stirred a fibre
      that lay close to his deepest interest in the fates of women&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps
      my mother was like this one.&rdquo; The old thought had come now with a
      new impetus of mingled feeling, and urged that exclamation in which both
      East and West have for ages concentrated their awe in the presence of
      inexorable calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The low-toned words seemed to have some reassurance in them for the
      hearer: she stepped forward close to the boat&rsquo;s side, and Deronda
      put out his hand, hoping now that she would let him help her in. She had
      already put her tiny hand into his which closed around it, when some new
      thought struck her, and drawing back she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nowhere to go&mdash;nobody belonging to me in all this land.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take you to a lady who has daughters,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      immediately. He felt a sort of relief in gathering that the wretched home
      and cruel friends he imagined her to be fleeing from were not in the near
      background. Still she hesitated, and said more timidly than ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you belong to the theatre?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have nothing to do with the theatre,&rdquo; said Deronda, in
      a decided tone. Then beseechingly, &ldquo;I will put you in perfect safety
      at once; with a lady, a good woman; I am sure she will be kind. Let us
      lose no time: you will make yourself ill. Life may still become sweet to
      you. There are good people&mdash;there are good women who will take care
      of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew backward no more, but stepped in easily, as if she were used to
      such action, and sat down on the cushions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a covering for your head,&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hat?&rdquo; (She lifted up her hands to her head.) &ldquo;It is
      quite hidden in the bush.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will find it,&rdquo; said Deronda, putting out his hand
      deprecatingly as she attempted to rise. &ldquo;The boat is fixed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumped out, found the hat, and lifted up the saturated cloak, wringing
      it and throwing it into the bottom of the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must carry the cloak away, to prevent any one who may have
      noticed you from thinking you have been drowned,&rdquo; he said,
      cheerfully, as he got in again and presented the old hat to her. &ldquo;I
      wish I had any other garment than my coat to offer you. But shall you mind
      throwing it over your shoulders while we are on the water? It is quite an
      ordinary thing to do, when people return late and are not enough provided
      with wraps.&rdquo; He held out the coat toward her with a smile, and there
      came a faint melancholy smile in answer, as she took it and put it on very
      cleverly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some biscuits&mdash;should you like them?&rdquo; said
      Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I cannot eat. I had still some money left to buy bread.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to ply his oar without further remark, and they went along
      swiftly for many minutes without speaking. She did not look at him, but
      was watching the oar, leaning forward in an attitude of repose, as if she
      were beginning to feel the comfort of returning warmth and the prospect of
      life instead of death. The twilight was deepening; the red flush was all
      gone and the little stars were giving their answer one after another. The
      moon was rising, but was still entangled among the trees and buildings.
      The light was not such that he could distinctly discern the expression of
      her features or her glance, but they were distinctly before him
      nevertheless&mdash;features and a glance which seemed to have given a
      fuller meaning for him to the human face. Among his anxieties one was
      dominant: his first impression about her, that her mind might be
      disordered, had not been quite dissipated: the project of suicide was
      unmistakable, and given a deeper color to every other suspicious sign. He
      longed to begin a conversation, but abstained, wishing to encourage the
      confidence that might induce her to speak first. At last she did speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to listen to the oar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had not come, I should have been dead now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot bear you to speak of that. I hope you will never be sorry
      that I came.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see how I shall be glad to live. The <i>maggior dolore</i>
      and the <i>miseria</i> have lasted longer than the <i>tempo felice</i>.&rdquo;
      She paused and then went on dreamily,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Dolore&mdash;miseria</i>&mdash;I
      think those words are alive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda was mute: to question her seemed an unwarrantable freedom; he
      shrank from appearing to claim the authority of a benefactor, or to treat
      her with the less reverence because she was in distress. She went on
      musingly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was not wicked. Death and life are one before the
      Eternal. I know our fathers slew their children and then slew themselves,
      to keep their souls pure. I meant it so. But now I am commanded to live. I
      cannot see how I shall live.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find friends. I will find them for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head and said mournfully, &ldquo;Not my mother and brother.
      I cannot find them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are English? You must be&mdash;speaking English so perfectly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer immediately, but looked at Deronda again, straining to
      see him in the double light. Until now she had been watching the oar. It
      seemed as if she were half roused, and wondered which part of her
      impression was dreaming and which waking. Sorrowful isolation had benumbed
      her sense of reality, and the power of distinguishing outward and inward
      was continually slipping away from her. Her look was full of wondering
      timidity such as the forsaken one in the desert might have lifted to the
      angelic vision before she knew whether his message was in anger or in
      pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to know if I am English?&rdquo; she said at last, while
      Deronda was reddening nervously under a gaze which he felt more fully than
      he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know nothing except what you like to tell me,&rdquo; he
      said, still uneasy in the fear that her mind was wandering. &ldquo;Perhaps
      it is not good for you to talk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will tell you. I am English-born. But I am a Jewess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda was silent, inwardly wondering that he had not said this to
      himself before, though any one who had seen delicate-faced Spanish girls
      might simply have guessed her to be Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you despise me for it?&rdquo; she said presently in low tones,
      which had a sadness that pierced like a cry from a small dumb creature in
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;I am not so foolish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know many Jews are bad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So are many Christians. But I should not think it fair for you to
      despise me because of that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother and brother were good. But I shall never find them. I am
      come a long way&mdash;from abroad. I ran away; but I cannot tell you&mdash;I
      cannot speak of it. I thought I might find my mother again&mdash;God would
      guide me. But then I despaired. This morning when the light came, I felt
      as if one word kept sounding within me&mdash;Never! never! But now&mdash;I
      begin&mdash;to think&mdash;&rdquo; her words were broken by rising sobs&mdash;&ldquo;I
      am commanded to live&mdash;perhaps we are going to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With an outburst of weeping she buried her head on her knees. He hoped
      that this passionate weeping might relieve her excitement. Meanwhile he
      was inwardly picturing in much embarrassment how he should present himself
      with her in Park Lane&mdash;the course which he had at first
      unreflectingly determined on. No one kinder and more gentle than Lady
      Mallinger; but it was hardly probable that she would be at home; and he
      had a shuddering sense of a lackey staring at this delicate, sorrowful
      image of womanhood&mdash;of glaring lights and fine staircases, and
      perhaps chilling suspicious manners from lady&rsquo;s maid and
      housekeeper, that might scare the mind already in a state of dangerous
      susceptibility. But to take her to any other shelter than a home already
      known to him was not to be contemplated: he was full of fears about the
      issue of the adventure which had brought on him a responsibility all the
      heavier for the strong and agitating impression this childlike creature
      had made on him. But another resource came to mind: he could venture to
      take her to Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s&mdash;to the small house at Chelsea&mdash;where
      he had been often enough since his return from abroad to feel sure that he
      could appeal there to generous hearts, which had a romantic readiness to
      believe in innocent need and to help it. Hans Meyrick was safe away in
      Italy, and Deronda felt the comfort of presenting himself with his charge
      at a house where he would be met by a motherly figure of quakerish
      neatness, and three girls who hardly knew of any evil closer to them than
      what lay in history-books, and dramas, and would at once associate a
      lovely Jewess with Rebecca in <i>Ivanhoe</i>, besides thinking that
      everything they did at Deronda&rsquo;s request would be done for their
      idol, Hans. The vision of the Chelsea home once raised, Deronda no longer
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumbling thither in the cab after the stillness of the water seemed
      long. Happily his charge had been quiet since her fit of weeping, and
      submitted like a tired child. When they were in the cab, she laid down her
      hat and tried to rest her head, but the jolting movement would not let it
      rest. Still she dozed, and her sweet head hung helpless, first on one
      side, then on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are too good to have any fear about taking her in,&rdquo;
      thought Deronda. Her person, her voice, her exquisite utterance, were one
      strong appeal to belief and tenderness. Yet what had been the history
      which had brought her to this desolation? He was going on a strange errand&mdash;to
      ask shelter for this waif. Then there occurred to him the beautiful story
      Plutarch somewhere tells of the Delphic women: how when the Maenads,
      outworn with their torch-lit wanderings, lay down to sleep in the
      market-place, the matrons came and stood silently round them to keep guard
      over their slumbers; then, when they waked, ministered to them tenderly
      and saw them safely to their own borders. He could trust the women he was
      going to for having hearts as good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda felt himself growing older this evening and entering on a new
      phase in finding a life to which his own had come&mdash;perhaps as a
      rescue; but how to make sure that snatching from death was rescue? The
      moment of finding a fellow-creature is often as full of mingled doubt and
      exultation as the moment of finding an idea.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Life is a various mother: now she dons
  Her plumes and brilliants, climbs the marble stairs
  With head aloft, nor ever turns her eyes
  On lackeys who attend her; now she dwells
  Grim-clad, up darksome alleys, breathes hot gin,
  And screams in pauper riot.

                             But to these
  She came a frugal matron, neat and deft,
  With cheerful morning thoughts and quick device
  To find the much in little.
</pre>
    <p>
      Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s house was not noisy: the front parlor looked on the
      river, and the back on gardens, so that though she was reading aloud to
      her daughters, the window could be left open to freshen the air of the
      small double room where a lamp and two candles were burning. The candles
      were on a table apart for Kate, who was drawing illustrations for a
      publisher; the lamp was not only for the reader but for Amy and Mab, who
      were embroidering satin cushions for &ldquo;the great world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, the house looked very narrow and shabby, the bright light through
      the holland blind showing the heavy old-fashioned window-frame; but it is
      pleasant to know that many such grim-walled slices of space in our foggy
      London have been and still are the homes of a culture the more spotlessly
      free from vulgarity, because poverty has rendered everything like display
      an impersonal question, and all the grand shows of the world simply a
      spectacle which rouses petty rivalry or vain effort after possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Meyricks&rsquo; was a home of that kind: and they all clung to this
      particular house in a row because its interior was filled with objects
      always in the same places, which, for the mother held memories of her
      marriage time, and for the young ones seemed as necessary and uncriticised
      a part of their world as the stars of the Great Bear seen from the back
      windows. Mrs. Meyrick had borne much stint of other matters that she might
      be able to keep some engravings specially cherished by her husband; and
      the narrow spaces of wall held a world history in scenes and heads which
      the children had early learned by heart. The chairs and tables were also
      old friends preferred to new. But in these two little parlors with no
      furniture that a broker would have cared to cheapen except the prints and
      piano, there was space and apparatus for a wide-glancing, nicely-select
      life, opened to the highest things in music, painting and poetry. I am not
      sure that in the times of greatest scarcity, before Kate could get
      paid-work, these ladies had always had a servant to light their fires and
      sweep their rooms; yet they were fastidious in some points, and could not
      believe that the manners of ladies in the fashionable world were so full
      of coarse selfishness, petty quarreling, and slang as they are represented
      to be in what are called literary photographs. The Meyricks had their
      little oddities, streaks of eccentricity from the mother&rsquo;s blood as
      well as the father&rsquo;s, their minds being like mediæval houses with
      unexpected recesses and openings from this into that, flights of steps and
      sudden outlooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But mother and daughters were all united by a triple bond&mdash;family
      love; admiration for the finest work, the best action; and habitual
      industry. Hans&rsquo; desire to spend some of his money in making their
      lives more luxurious had been resisted by all of them, and both they and
      he had been thus saved from regrets at the threatened triumphs of his
      yearning for art over the attractions of secured income&mdash;a triumph
      that would by-and-by oblige him to give up his fellowship. They could all
      afford to laugh at his Gavarni-caricatures and to hold him blameless in
      following a natural bent which their unselfishness and independence had
      left without obstacle. It was enough for them to go on in their old way,
      only having a grand treat of opera-going (to the gallery) when Hans came
      home on a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the group they made this evening, one could hardly wish them to
      change their way of life. They were all alike small, and so in due
      proportion to their miniature rooms. Mrs. Meyrick was reading aloud from a
      French book; she was a lively little woman, half French, half Scotch, with
      a pretty articulateness of speech that seemed to make daylight in her
      hearer&rsquo;s understanding. Though she was not yet fifty, her rippling
      hair, covered by a quakerish net cap, was chiefly gray, but her eyebrows
      were brown as the bright eyes below them; her black dress, almost like a
      priest&rsquo;s cassock with its rows of buttons, suited a neat figure
      hardly five feet high. The daughters were to match the mother, except that
      Mab had Hans&rsquo; light hair and complexion, with a bossy, irregular
      brow, and other quaintnesses that reminded one of him. Everything about
      them was compact, from the firm coils of their hair, fastened back <i>à la
      Chinoise</i>, to their gray skirts in Puritan nonconformity with the
      fashion, which at that time would have demanded that four feminine
      circumferences should fill all the free space in the front parlor. All
      four, if they had been wax-work, might have been packed easily in a
      fashionable lady&rsquo;s traveling trunk. Their faces seemed full of
      speech, as if their minds had been shelled, after the manner of
      horse-chestnuts, and become brightly visible. The only large thing of its
      kind in the room was Hafiz, the Persian cat, comfortably poised on the
      brown leather back of a chair, and opening his large eyes now and then to
      see that the lower animals were not in any mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book Mrs. Meyrick had before her was Erckmann-Chatrian&rsquo;s <i>Historie
      d&rsquo;un Conscrit</i>. She had just finished reading it aloud, and Mab,
      who had let her work fall on the ground while she stretched her head
      forward and fixed her eyes on the reader, exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that is the finest story in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Mab!&rdquo; said Amy, &ldquo;it is the last you have
      heard. Everything that pleases you is the best in its turn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hardly to be called a story,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;It is a
      bit of history brought near us with a strong telescope. We can see the
      soldiers&rsquo; faces: no, it is more than that&mdash;we can hear
      everything&mdash;we can almost hear their hearts beat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you call it,&rdquo; said Mab, flirting away
      her thimble. &ldquo;Call it a chapter in Revelations. It makes me want to
      do something good, something grand. It makes me so sorry for everybody. It
      makes me like Schiller&mdash;I want to take the world in my arms and kiss
      it. I must kiss you instead, little mother!&rdquo; She threw her arms
      round her mother&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you are in that mood, Mab, down goes your work,&rdquo;
      said Amy. &ldquo;It would be doing something good to finish your cushion
      without soiling it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh!&rdquo; groaned Mab, as she stooped to pick up
      her work and thimble. &ldquo;I wish I had three wounded conscripts to take
      care of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would spill their beef tea while you were talking,&rdquo; said
      Amy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mab! don&rsquo;t be hard on her,&rdquo; said the mother.
      &ldquo;Give me the embroidery now, child. You go on with your enthusiasm,
      and I will go on with the pink and white poppy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma, I think you are more caustic than Amy,&rdquo; said Kate,
      while she drew her head back to look at her drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh!&rdquo; cried Mab again, rising and stretching
      her arms. &ldquo;I wish something wonderful would happen. I feel like the
      deluge. The waters of the great deep are broken up, and the windows of
      heaven are opened. I must sit down and play the scales.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mab was opening the piano while the others were laughing at this climax,
      when a cab stopped before the house, and there forthwith came a quick rap
      of the knocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick, starting up, &ldquo;it is after
      ten, and Phoebe is gone to bed.&rdquo; She hastened out, leaving the
      parlor door open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Deronda!&rdquo; The girls could hear this exclamation from
      their mamma. Mab clasped her hands, saying in a loud whisper, &ldquo;There
      now! something <i>is</i> going to happen.&rdquo; Kate and Amy gave up
      their work in amazement. But Deronda&rsquo;s tone in reply was so low that
      they could not hear his words, and Mrs. Meyrick immediately closed the
      parlor door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I am trusting to your goodness in a most extraordinary way,&rdquo;
      Deronda went on, after giving his brief narrative; &ldquo;but you can
      imagine how helpless I feel with a young creature like this on my hands. I
      could not go with her among strangers, and in her nervous state I should
      dread taking her into a house full of servants. I have trusted to your
      mercy. I hope you will not think my act unwarrantable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary. You have honored me by trusting me. I see your
      difficulty. Pray bring her in. I will go and prepare the girls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While Deronda went back to the cab, Mrs. Meyrick turned into the parlor
      again and said: &ldquo;Here is somebody to take care of instead of your
      wounded conscripts, Mab: a poor girl who was going to drown herself in
      despair. Mr. Deronda found her only just in time to save her. He brought
      her along in his boat, and did not know what else it would be safe to do
      with her, so he has trusted us and brought her here. It seems she is a
      Jewess, but quite refined, he says&mdash;knowing Italian and music.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The three girls, wondering and expectant, came forward and stood near each
      other in mute confidence that they were all feeling alike under this
      appeal to their compassion. Mab looked rather awe-stricken, as if this
      answer to her wish were something preternatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Deronda going to the door of the cab where the pale face was now
      gazing out with roused observation, said, &ldquo;I have brought you to
      some of the kindest people in the world: there are daughters like you. It
      is a happy home. Will you let me take you to them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped out obediently, putting her hand in his and forgetting her
      hat; and when Deronda led her into the full light of the parlor where the
      four little women stood awaiting her, she made a picture that would have
      stirred much duller sensibilities than theirs. At first she was a little
      dazed by the sudden light, and before she had concentrated her glance he
      had put her hand into the mother&rsquo;s. He was inwardly rejoicing that
      the Meyricks were so small: the dark-curled head was the highest among
      them. The poor wanderer could not be afraid of these gentle faces so near
      hers: and now she was looking at each of them in turn while the mother
      said, &ldquo;You must be weary, poor child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will take care of you&mdash;we will comfort you&mdash;we will
      love you,&rdquo; cried Mab, no longer able to restrain herself, and taking
      the small right hand caressingly between both her own. This gentle
      welcoming warmth was penetrating the bewildered one: she hung back just
      enough to see better the four faces in front of her, whose good will was
      being reflected in hers, not in any smile, but in that undefinable change
      which tells us that anxiety is passing in contentment. For an instant she
      looked up at Deronda, as if she were referring all this mercy to him, and
      then again turning to Mrs. Meyrick, said with more collectedness in her
      sweet tones than he had heard before,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a stranger. I am a Jewess. You might have thought I was
      wicked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we are sure you are good,&rdquo; burst out Mab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We think no evil of you, poor child. You shall be safe with us,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Meyrick. &ldquo;Come now and sit down. You must have some food,
      and then you must go to rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger looked up again at Deronda, who said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have no more fears with these friends? You will rest
      to-night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I should not fear. I should rest. I think these are the
      ministering angels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Meyrick wanted to lead her to seat, but again hanging back gently,
      the poor weary thing spoke as if with a scruple at being received without
      a further account of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Mirah Lapidoth. I am come a long way, all the way from
      Prague by myself. I made my escape. I ran away from dreadful things. I
      came to find my mother and brother in London. I had been taken from my
      mother when I was little, but I thought I could find her again. I had
      trouble&mdash;the houses were all gone&mdash;I could not find her. It has
      been a long while, and I had not much money. That is why I am in distress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our mother will be good to you,&rdquo; cried Mab. &ldquo;See what a
      nice little mother she is!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do sit down now,&rdquo; said Kate, moving a chair forward, while
      Amy ran to get some tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah resisted no longer, but seated herself with perfect grace, crossing
      her little feet, laying her hands one over the other on her lap, and
      looking at her friends with placid reverence; whereupon Hafiz, who had
      been watching the scene restlessly came forward with tail erect and rubbed
      himself against her ankles. Deronda felt it time to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you allow me to come again and inquire&mdash;perhaps at five
      to-morrow?&rdquo; he said to Mrs. Meyrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, pray; we shall have had time to make acquaintance then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Deronda, looking down at Mirah, and putting
      out his hand. She rose as she took it, and the moment brought back to them
      both strongly the other moment when she had first taken that outstretched
      hand. She lifted her eyes to his and said with reverential fervor, &ldquo;The
      God of our fathers bless you and deliver you from all evil as you have
      delivered me. I did not believe there was any man so good. None before
      have thought me worthy of the best. You found me poor and miserable, yet
      you have given me the best.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda could not speak, but with silent adieux to the Meyricks, hurried
      away.

      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;I pity the man who can travel from Dan to Beersheba, and say, &lsquo;Tis
    all barren&rsquo;: and so it is: and so is all the world to him who will not
    cultivate the fruits it offers.&rdquo;&mdash;STERNE: <i>Sentimental Journey</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      To say that Deronda was romantic would be to misrepresent him; but under
      his calm and somewhat self-repressed exterior there was a fervor which
      made him easily find poetry and romance among the events of every-day
      life. And perhaps poetry and romance are as plentiful as ever in the world
      except for those phlegmatic natures who I suspect would in any age have
      regarded them as a dull form of erroneous thinking. They exist very easily
      in the same room with the microscope and even in railway carriages: what
      banishes them in the vacuum in gentlemen and lady passengers. How should
      all the apparatus of heaven and earth, from the farthest firmament to the
      tender bosom of the mother who nourished us, make poetry for a mind that
      had no movements of awe and tenderness, no sense of fellowship which
      thrills from the near to the distant, and back again from the distant to
      the near?
    </p>
    <p>
      To Deronda this event of finding Mirah was as heart-stirring as anything
      that befell Orestes or Rinaldo. He sat up half the night, living again
      through the moments since he had first discerned Mirah on the river-brink,
      with the fresh and fresh vividness which belongs to emotive memory. When
      he took up a book to try and dull this urgency of inward vision, the
      printed words were no more than a network through which he saw and heard
      everything as clearly as before&mdash;saw not only the actual events of
      two hours, but possibilities of what had been and what might be which
      those events were enough to feed with the warm blood of passionate hope
      and fear. Something in his own experience caused Mirah&rsquo;s search
      after her mother to lay hold with peculiar force on his imagination. The
      first prompting of sympathy was to aid her in her search: if given persons
      were extant in London there were ways of finding them, as subtle as
      scientific experiment, the right machinery being set at work. But here the
      mixed feelings which belonged to Deronda&rsquo;s kindred experience
      naturally transfused themselves into his anxiety on behalf of Mirah.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desire to know his own mother, or to know about her, was constantly
      haunted with dread; and in imagining what might befall Mirah it quickly
      occurred to him that finding the mother and brother from whom she had been
      parted when she was a little one might turn out to be a calamity. When she
      was in the boat she said that her mother and brother were good; but the
      goodness might have been chiefly in her own ignorant innocence and
      yearning memory, and the ten or twelve years since the parting had been
      time enough for much worsening. Spite of his strong tendency to side with
      the objects of prejudice, and in general with those who got the worst of
      it, his interest had never been practically drawn toward existing Jews,
      and the facts he knew about them, whether they walked conspicuous in fine
      apparel or lurked in by-streets, were chiefly of a sort most repugnant to
      him. Of learned and accomplished Jews he took it for granted that they had
      dropped their religion, and wished to be merged in the people of their
      native lands. Scorn flung at a Jew as such would have roused all his
      sympathy in griefs of inheritance; but the indiscriminate scorn of a race
      will often strike a specimen who has well earned it on his own account,
      and might fairly be gibbeted as a rascally son of Adam. It appears that
      the Caribs, who know little of theology, regard thieving as a practice
      peculiarly connected with Christian tenets, and probably they could allege
      experimental grounds for this opinion. Deronda could not escape (who can?)
      knowing ugly stories of Jewish characteristics and occupations; and though
      one of his favorite protests was against the severance of past and present
      history, he was like others who shared his protest, in never having cared
      to reach any more special conclusions about actual Jews than that they
      retained the virtues and vices of a long-oppressed race. But now that
      Mirah&rsquo;s longing roused his mind to a closer survey of details, very
      disagreeable images urged themselves of what it might be to find out this
      middle-aged Jewess and her son. To be sure, there was the exquisite
      refinement and charm of the creature herself to make a presumption in
      favor of her immediate kindred, but&mdash;he must wait to know more:
      perhaps through Mrs. Meyrick he might gather some guiding hints from Mirah&rsquo;s
      own lips. Her voice, her accent, her looks&mdash;all the sweet purity that
      clothed her as with a consecrating garment made him shrink the more from
      giving her, either ideally or practically, an association with what was
      hateful or contaminating. But these fine words with which we fumigate and
      becloud unpleasant facts are not the language in which we think. Deronda&rsquo;s
      thinking went on in rapid images of what might be: he saw himself guided
      by some official scout into a dingy street; he entered through a dim
      doorway, and saw a hawk-eyed woman, rough-headed, and unwashed, cheapening
      a hungry girl&rsquo;s last bit of finery; or in some quarter only the more
      hideous for being smarter, he found himself under the breath of a young
      Jew talkative and familiar, willing to show his acquaintance with
      gentlemen&rsquo;s tastes, and not fastidious in any transactions with
      which they would favor him&mdash;and so on through the brief chapter of
      his experience in this kind. Excuse him: his mind was not apt to run
      spontaneously into insulting ideas, or to practice a form of wit which
      identifies Moses with the advertisement sheet; but he was just now
      governed by dread, and if Mirah&rsquo;s parents had been Christian, the
      chief difference would have been that his forebodings would have been fed
      with wider knowledge. It was the habit of his mind to connect dread with
      unknown parentage, and in this case as well as his own there was enough to
      make the connection reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was to be done with Mirah? She needed shelter and protection in
      the fullest sense, and all his chivalrous sentiment roused itself to
      insist that the sooner and the more fully he could engage for her the
      interest of others besides himself, the better he should fulfill her
      claims on him. He had no right to provide for her entirely, though he
      might be able to do so; the very depth of the impression she had produced
      made him desire that she should understand herself to be entirely
      independent of him; and vague visions of the future which he tried to
      dispel as fantastic left their influence in an anxiety stronger than any
      motive he could give for it, that those who saw his actions closely should
      be acquainted from the first with the history of his relation to Mirah. He
      had learned to hate secrecy about the grand ties and obligations of his
      life&mdash;to hate it the more because a strong spell of interwoven
      sensibilities hindered him from breaking such secrecy. Deronda had made a
      vow to himself that&mdash;since the truths which disgrace mortals are not
      all of their own making&mdash;the truth should never be made a disgrace to
      another by his act. He was not without terror lest he should break this
      vow, and fall into the apologetic philosophy which explains the world into
      containing nothing better than one&rsquo;s own conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one moment he resolved to tell the whole of his adventure to Sir Hugo
      and Lady Mallinger the next morning at breakfast, but the possibility that
      something quite new might reveal itself on his next visit to Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s
      checked this impulse, and he finally went to sleep on the conclusion that
      he would wait until that visit had been made.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;It will hardly be denied that even in this frail and corrupted world,
    we sometimes meet persons who, in their very mien and aspect, as well
    as in the whole habit of life, manifest such a signature and stamp of
    virtue, as to make our judgment of them a matter of intuition rather
    than the result of continued  examination.&rdquo;&mdash;ALEXANDER KNOX: quoted in

    <p>
      Mirah said that she had slept well that night; and when she came down in
      Mab&rsquo;s black dress, her dark hair curling in fresh fibrils as it
      gradually dried from its plenteous bath, she looked like one who was
      beginning to take comfort after the long sorrow and watching which had
      paled her cheek and made blue semicircles under her eyes. It was Mab who
      carried her breakfast and ushered her down&mdash;with some pride in the
      effect produced by a pair of tiny felt slippers which she had rushed out
      to buy because there were no shoes in the house small enough for Mirah,
      whose borrowed dress ceased about her ankles and displayed the cheap
      clothing that, moulding itself on her feet, seemed an adornment as choice
      as the sheaths of buds. The farthing buckles were bijoux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you please, mamma?&rdquo; cried Mab, clasping her hands and
      stooping toward Mirah&rsquo;s feet, as she entered the parlor; &ldquo;look
      at the slippers, how beautiful they fit! I declare she is like the Queen
      Budoor&mdash;&rsquo; two delicate feet, the work of the protecting and
      all-recompensing Creator, support her; and I wonder how they can sustain
      what is above them.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah looked down at her own feet in a childlike way and then smiled at
      Mrs. Meyrick, who was saying inwardly, &ldquo;One could hardly imagine
      this creature having an evil thought. But wise people would tell me to be
      cautious.&rdquo; She returned Mirah&rsquo;s smile and said, &ldquo;I fear
      the feet have had to sustain their burden a little too often lately. But
      to-day she will rest and be my companion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she will tell you so many things and I shall not hear them,&rdquo;
      grumbled Mab, who felt herself in the first volume of a delightful romance
      and obliged to miss some chapters because she had to go to pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kate was already gone to make sketches along the river, and Amy was away
      on business errands. It was what the mother wished, to be alone with this
      stranger, whose story must be a sorrowful one, yet was needful to be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small front parlor was as good as a temple that morning. The sunlight
      was on the river and soft air came in through the open window; the walls
      showed a glorious silent cloud of witnesses&mdash;the Virgin soaring amid
      her cherubic escort; grand Melancholia with her solemn universe; the
      Prophets and Sibyls; the School of Athens; the Last Supper; mystic groups
      where far-off ages made one moment; grave Holbein and Rembrandt heads; the
      Tragic Muse; last-century children at their musings or their play; Italian
      poets&mdash;all were there through the medium of a little black and white.
      The neat mother who had weathered her troubles, and come out of them with
      a face still cheerful, was sorting colored wools for her embroidery. Hafiz
      purred on the window-ledge, the clock on the mantle-piece ticked without
      hurry, and the occasional sound of wheels seemed to lie outside the more
      massive central quiet. Mrs. Meyrick thought that this quiet might be the
      best invitation to speech on the part of her companion, and chose not to
      disturb it by remark. Mirah sat opposite in her former attitude, her hands
      clasped on her lap, her ankles crossed, her eyes at first traveling slowly
      over the objects around her, but finally resting with a sort of placid
      reverence on Mrs. Meyrick. At length she began to speak softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember my mother&rsquo;s face better than anything; yet I was
      not seven when I was taken away, and I am nineteen now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick. &ldquo;There are
      some earliest things that last the longest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it was the earliest. I think my life began with waking up
      and loving my mother&rsquo;s face: it was so near to me, and her arms were
      round me, and she sang to me. One hymn she sang so often, so often: and
      then she taught me to sing it with her: it was the first I ever sang. They
      were always Hebrew hymns she sang; and because I never knew the meaning of
      the words they seemed full of nothing but our love and happiness. When I
      lay in my little bed and it was all white above me, she used to bend over
      me, between me and the white, and sing in a sweet, low voice. I can dream
      myself back into that time when I am awake, and it often comes back to me
      in my sleep&mdash;my hand is very little, I put it up to her face and she
      kisses it. Sometimes in my dreams I begin to tremble and think that we are
      both dead; but then I wake up and my hand lies like this, and for a moment
      I hardly know myself. But if I could see my mother again I should know
      her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must expect some change after twelve years,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Meyrick, gently. &ldquo;See my grey hair: ten years ago it was bright
      brown. The days and months pace over us like restless little birds, and
      leave the marks of their feet backward and forward; especially when they
      are like birds with heavy hearts&mdash;then they tread heavily.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I am sure her heart has been heavy for want of me. But to feel
      her joy if we could meet again, and I could make her know I love her and
      give her deep comfort after all her mourning! If that could be, I should
      mind nothing; I should be glad that I have lived through my trouble. I did
      despair. The world seemed miserable and wicked; none helped me so that I
      could bear their looks and words; I felt that my mother was dead, and
      death was the only way to her. But then in the last moment&mdash;yesterday,
      when I longed for the water to close over me&mdash;and I thought that
      death was the best image of mercy&mdash;then goodness came to me living,
      and I felt trust in the living. And&mdash;it is strange&mdash;but I began
      to hope that she was living too. And now I with you&mdash;here&mdash;this
      morning, peace and hope have come into me like a flood. I want nothing; I
      can wait; because I hope and believe and am grateful&mdash;oh, so
      grateful! You have not thought evil of me&mdash;you have not despised me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah spoke with low-toned fervor, and sat as still as a picture all the
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many others would have felt as we do, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Meyrick, feeling a mist come over her eyes as she looked at her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did not meet them&mdash;they did not come to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was it that you were taken from your mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I am a long while coming to that. It is dreadful to speak of,
      yet I must tell you&mdash;I must tell you everything. My father&mdash;it
      was he that took me away. I thought we were only going on a little
      journey; and I was pleased. There was a box with all my little things in.
      But we went on board a ship, and got farther and farther away from the
      land. Then I was ill; and I thought it would never end&mdash;it was the
      first misery, and it seemed endless. But at last we landed. I knew nothing
      then, and believed what my father said. He comforted me, and told me I
      should go back to my mother. But it was America we had reached, and it was
      long years before we came back to Europe. At first I often asked my father
      when we were going back; and I tried to learn writing fast, because I
      wanted to write to my mother; but one day when he found me trying to write
      a letter, he took me on his knee and told me that my mother and brother
      were dead; that was why we did not go back. I remember my brother a
      little; he carried me once; but he was not always at home. I believed my
      father when he said that they were dead. I saw them under the earth when
      he said they were there, with their eyes forever closed. I never thought
      of its not being true; and I used to cry every night in my bed for a long
      while. Then when she came so often to me, in my sleep, I thought she must
      be living about me though I could not always see her, and that comforted
      me. I was never afraid in the dark, because of that; and very often in the
      day I used to shut my eyes and bury my face and try to see her and to hear
      her singing. I came to do that at last without shutting my eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah paused with a sweet content in her face, as if she were having her
      happy vision, while she looked out toward the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still your father was not unkind to you, I hope,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Meyrick, after a minute, anxious to recall her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he petted me, and took pains to teach me. He was an actor; and
      I found out, after, that the &lsquo;Coburg&rsquo; I used to hear of his
      going to at home was a theatre. But he had more to do with the theatre
      than acting. He had not always been an actor; he had been a teacher, and
      knew many languages. His acting was not very good; I think, but he managed
      the stage, and wrote and translated plays. An Italian lady, a singer,
      lived with us a long time. They both taught me, and I had a master
      besides, who made me learn by heart and recite. I worked quite hard,
      though I was so little; and I was not nine when I first went on the stage.
      I could easily learn things, and I was not afraid. But then and ever since
      I hated our way of life. My father had money, and we had finery about us
      in a disorderly way; always there were men and women coming and going;
      there was loud laughing and disputing, strutting, snapping of fingers,
      jeering, faces I did not like to look at&mdash;though many petted and
      caressed me. But then I remembered my mother. Even at first when I
      understood nothing, I shrank away from all those things outside me into
      companionship with thoughts that were not like them; and I gathered
      thoughts very fast, because I read many things&mdash;plays and poetry,
      Shakespeare and Schiller, and learned evil and good. My father began to
      believe that I might be a great singer: my voice was considered wonderful
      for a child; and he had the best teaching for me. But it was painful that
      he boasted of me, and set me to sing for show at any minute, as if I had
      been a musical box. Once when I was nine years old, I played the part of a
      little girl who had been forsaken and did not know it, and sat singing to
      herself while she played with flowers. I did it without any trouble; but
      the clapping and all the sounds of the theatre were hateful to me; and I
      never liked the praise I had, because it all seemed very hard and
      unloving: I missed the love and trust I had been born into. I made a life
      in my own thoughts quite different from everything about me: I chose what
      seemed to me beautiful out of the plays and everything, and made my world
      out of it; and it was like a sharp knife always grazing me that we had two
      sorts of life which jarred so with each other&mdash;women looking good and
      gentle on the stage, and saying good things as if they felt them, and
      directly after I saw them with coarse, ugly manners. My father sometimes
      noticed my shrinking ways; and Signora said one day, when I had been
      rehearsing, &lsquo;She will never be an artist: she has no notion of being
      anybody but herself. That does very well now, but by-and-by you will see&mdash;she
      will have no more face and action than a singing-bird.&rsquo; My father
      was angry, and they quarreled. I sat alone and cried, because what she had
      said was like a long unhappy future unrolled before me. I did not want to
      be an artist; but this was what my father expected of me. After a while
      Signora left us, and a governess used to come and give me lessons in
      different things, because my father began to be afraid of my singing too
      much; but I still acted from time to time. Rebellious feelings grew
      stronger in me, and I wished to get away from this life; but I could not
      tell where to go, and I dreaded the world. Besides, I felt it would be
      wrong to leave my father: I dreaded doing wrong, for I thought I might get
      wicked and hateful to myself, in the same way that many others seemed
      hateful to me. For so long, so long I had never felt my outside world
      happy; and if I got wicked I should lose my world of happy thoughts where
      my mother lived with me. That was my childish notion all through those
      years. Oh how long they were!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah fell to musing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you no teaching about what was your duty?&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Meyrick. She did not like to say &ldquo;religion&rdquo;&mdash;finding
      herself on inspection rather dim as to what the Hebrew religion might have
      turned into at this date.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;only that I ought to do what my father wished. He did not
      follow our religion at New York, and I think he wanted me not to know much
      about it. But because my mother used to take me to the synagogue, and I
      remembered sitting on her knee and looking through the railing and hearing
      the chanting and singing, I longed to go. One day when I was quite small I
      slipped out and tried to find the synagogue, but I lost myself a long
      while till a peddler questioned me and took me home. My father, missing
      me, had been much in fear, and was very angry. I too had been so
      frightened at losing myself that it was long before I thought of venturing
      out again. But after Signora left us we went to rooms where our landlady
      was a Jewess and observed her religion. I asked her to take me with her to
      the synagogue; and I read in her prayer-books and Bible, and when I had
      money enough I asked her to buy me books of my own, for these books seemed
      a closer companionship with my mother: I knew that she must have looked at
      the very words and said them. In that way I have come to know a little of
      our religion, and the history of our people, besides piecing together what
      I read in plays and other books about Jews and Jewesses; because I was
      sure my mother obeyed her religion. I had left off asking my father about
      her. It is very dreadful to say it, but I began to disbelieve him. I had
      found that he did not always tell the truth, and made promises without
      meaning to keep them; and that raised my suspicion that my mother and
      brother were still alive though he had told me they were dead. For in
      going over the past again as I got older and knew more, I felt sure that
      my mother had been deceived, and had expected to see us back again after a
      very little while; and my father taking me on his knee and telling me that
      my mother and brother were both dead seemed to me now but a bit of acting,
      to set my mind at rest. The cruelty of that falsehood sank into me, and I
      hated all untruth because of it. I wrote to my mother secretly: I knew the
      street, Colman Street, where we lived, and that it was not Blackfriars
      Bridge and the Coburg, and that our name was Cohen then, though my father
      called us Lapidoth, because, he said, it was a name of his forefathers in
      Poland. I sent my letter secretly; but no answer came, and I thought there
      was no hope for me. Our life in America did not last much longer. My
      father suddenly told me we were to pack up and go to Hamburg, and I was
      rather glad. I hoped we might get among a different sort of people, and I
      knew German quite well&mdash;some German plays almost all by heart. My
      father spoke it better than he spoke English. I was thirteen then, and I
      seemed to myself quite old&mdash;I knew so much, and yet so little. I
      think other children cannot feel as I did. I had often wished that I had
      been drowned when I was going away from my mother. But I set myself to
      obey and suffer: what else could I do? One day when we were on our voyage,
      a new thought came into my mind. I was not very ill that time, and I kept
      on deck a good deal. My father acted and sang and joked to amuse people on
      board, and I used often to hear remarks about him. One day, when I was
      looking at the sea and nobody took notice of me, I overheard a gentleman
      say, &lsquo;Oh, he is one of those clever Jews&mdash;a rascal, I shouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder. There&rsquo;s no race like them for cunning in the men and beauty
      in the women. I wonder what market he means that daughter for.&rsquo; When
      I heard this it darted into my mind that the unhappiness in my life came
      from my being a Jewess, and that always to the end the world would think
      slightly of me and that I must bear it, for I should be judged by that
      name; and it comforted me to believe that my suffering was part of the
      affliction of my people, my part in the long song of mourning that has
      been going on through ages and ages. For if many of our race were wicked
      and made merry in their wickedness&mdash;what was that but part of the
      affliction borne by the just among them, who were despised for the sins of
      their brethren?&mdash;But you have not rejected me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah had changed her tone in this last sentence, having suddenly
      reflected that at this moment she had reason not for complaint but for
      gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we will try to save you from being judged unjustly by others,
      my poor child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick, who had now given up all attempt
      at going on with her work, and sat listening with folded hands and a face
      hardly less eager than Mab&rsquo;s would have been. &ldquo;Go on, go on:
      tell me all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that we lived in different towns&mdash;Hamburg and Vienna,
      the longest. I began to study singing again: and my father always got
      money about the theatres. I think he brought a good deal of money from
      America, I never knew why we left. For some time he was in great spirits
      about my singing, and he made me rehearse parts and act continually. He
      looked forward to my coming out in the opera. But by-and-by it seemed that
      my voice would never be strong enough&mdash;it did not fulfill its
      promise. My master at Vienna said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t strain it further:
      it will never do for the public:&mdash;it is gold, but a thread of gold
      dust.&rsquo; My father was bitterly disappointed: we were not so well off
      at that time. I think I have not quite told you what I felt about my
      father. I knew he was fond of me and meant to indulge me, and that made me
      afraid of hurting him; but he always mistook what would please me and give
      me happiness. It was his nature to take everything lightly; and I soon
      left off asking him any questions about things that I cared for much,
      because he always turned them off with a joke. He would even ridicule our
      own people; and once when he had been imitating their movements and their
      tones in praying, only to make others laugh, I could not restrain myself&mdash;for
      I always had an anger in my heart about my mother&mdash;and when we were
      alone, I said, &lsquo;Father, you ought not to mimic our own people before
      Christians who mock them: would it not be bad if I mimicked you, that they
      might mock you?&rsquo; But he only shrugged his shoulders and laughed and
      pinched my chin, and said, &lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t do it, my dear.&rdquo;
      It was this way of turning off everything, that made a great wall between
      me and my father, and whatever I felt most I took the most care to hide
      from him. For there were some things&mdash;when they were laughed at I
      could not bear it: the world seemed like a hell to me. Is this world and
      all the life upon it only like a farce or a vaudeville, where you find no
      great meanings? Why then are there tragedies and grand operas, where men
      do difficult things and choose to suffer? I think it is silly to speak of
      all things as a joke. And I saw that his wishing me to sing the greatest
      music, and parts in grand operas, was only wishing for what would fetch
      the greatest price. That hemmed in my gratitude for his affectionateness,
      and the tenderest feeling I had toward him was pity. Yes, I did sometimes
      pity him. He had aged and changed. Now he was no longer so lively. I
      thought he seemed worse&mdash;less good to others than to me. Every now
      and then in the latter years his gaiety went away suddenly, and he would
      sit at home silent and gloomy; or he would come in and fling himself down
      and sob, just as I have done myself when I have been in trouble. If I put
      my hand on his knee and say, &lsquo;What is the matter, father?&rsquo; he
      would make no answer, but would draw my arm round his neck and put his arm
      round me and go on crying. There never came any confidence between us; but
      oh, I was sorry for him. At those moments I knew he must feel his life
      bitter, and I pressed my cheek against his head and prayed. Those moments
      were what most bound me to him; and I used to think how much my mother
      once loved him, else she would not have married him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But soon there came the dreadful time. We had been at Pesth and we
      came back to Vienna. In spite of what my master Leo had said, my father
      got me an engagement, not at the opera, but to take singing parts at a
      suburb theatre in Vienna. He had nothing to do with the theatre then; I
      did not understand what he did, but I think he was continually at a
      gambling house, though he was careful always about taking me to the
      theatre. I was very miserable. The plays I acted in were detestable to me.
      Men came about us and wanted to talk to me: women and men seemed to look
      at me with a sneering smile; it was no better than a fiery furnace.
      Perhaps I make it worse than it was&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know that life:
      but the glare and the faces, and my having to go on and act and sing what
      I hated, and then see people who came to stare at me behind the scenes&mdash;it
      was all so much worse than when I was a little girl. I went through with
      it; I did it; I had set my mind to obey my father and work, for I saw
      nothing better that I could do. But I felt that my voice was getting
      weaker, and I knew that my acting was not good except when it was not
      really acting, but the part was one that I could be myself in, and some
      feeling within me carried me along. That was seldom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, in the midst of all this, the news came to me one morning
      that my father had been taken to prison, and he had sent for me. He did
      not tell me the reason why he was there, but he ordered me to go to an
      address he gave me, to see a Count who would be able to get him released.
      The address was to some public rooms where I was to ask for the Count, and
      beg him to come to my father. I found him, and recognized him as a
      gentleman whom I had seen the other night for the first time behind the
      scenes. That agitated me, for I remembered his way of looking at me and
      kissing my hand&mdash;I thought it was in mockery. But I delivered my
      errand, and he promised to go immediately to my father, who came home
      again that very evening, bringing the Count with him. I now began to feel
      a horrible dread of this man, for he worried me with his attentions, his
      eyes were always on me: I felt sure that whatever else there might be in
      his mind toward me, below it all there was scorn for the Jewess and the
      actress. And when he came to me the next day in the theatre and would put
      my shawl around me, a terror took hold of me; I saw that my father wanted
      me to look pleased. The Count was neither very young nor very old; his
      hair and eyes were pale; he was tall and walked heavily, and his face was
      heavy and grave except when he looked at me. He smiled at me, and his
      smile went through me with horror: I could not tell why he was so much
      worse to me than other men. Some feelings are like our hearing: they come
      as sounds do, before we know their reason. My father talked to me about
      him when we were alone, and praised him&mdash;said what a good friend he
      had been. I said nothing, because I supposed he had got my father out of
      prison. When the Count came again, my father left the room. He asked me if
      I liked being on the stage. I said No, I only acted in obedience to my
      father. He always spoke French, and called me <i>petite ange</i> and such
      things, which I felt insulting. I knew he meant to make love to me, and I
      had it firmly in my mind that a nobleman and one who was not a Jew could
      have no love for me that was not half contempt. But then he told me that I
      need not act any longer; he wished me to visit him at his beautiful place,
      where I might be queen of everything. It was difficult to me to speak, I
      felt so shaken with anger: I could only say, &lsquo;I would rather stay on
      the stage forever,&rsquo; and I left him there. Hurrying out of the room I
      saw my father sauntering in the passage. My heart was crushed. I went past
      him and locked myself up. It had sunk into me that my father was in a
      conspiracy with that man against me. But the next day he persuaded me to
      come out: he said that I had mistaken everything, and he would explain: if
      I did not come out and act and fulfill my engagement, we should be ruined
      and he must starve. So I went on acting, and for a week or more the Count
      never came near me. My father changed our lodgings, and kept at home
      except when he went to the theatre with me. He began one day to speak
      discouragingly of my acting, and say, I could never go on singing in
      public&mdash;I should lose my voice&mdash;I ought to think of my future,
      and not put my nonsensical feelings between me and my fortune. He said,
      &lsquo;What will you do? You will be brought down to sing and beg at
      people&rsquo;s doors. You have had a splendid offer and ought to accept
      it.&rsquo; I could not speak: a horror took possession of me when I
      thought of my mother and of him. I felt for the first time that I should
      not do wrong to leave him. But the next day he told me that he had put an
      end to my engagement at the theatre, and that we were to go to Prague. I
      was getting suspicious of everything, and my will was hardening to act
      against him. It took us two days to pack and get ready; and I had it in my
      mind that I might be obliged to run away from my father, and then I would
      come to London and try if it were possible to find my mother. I had a
      little money, and I sold some things to get more. I packed a few clothes
      in a little bag that I could carry with me, and I kept my mind on the
      watch. My father&rsquo;s silence&mdash;his letting drop that subject of
      the Count&rsquo;s offer&mdash;made me feel sure that there was a plan
      against me. I felt as if it had been a plan to take me to a madhouse. I
      once saw a picture of a madhouse, that I could never forget; it seemed to
      me very much like some of the life I had seen&mdash;the people strutting,
      quarreling, leering&mdash;the faces with cunning and malice in them. It
      was my will to keep myself from wickedness; and I prayed for help. I had
      seen what despised women were: and my heart turned against my father, for
      I saw always behind him that man who made me shudder. You will think I had
      not enough reason for my suspicions, and perhaps I had not, outside my own
      feeling; but it seemed to me that my mind had been lit up, and all that
      might be stood out clear and sharp. If I slept, it was only to see the
      same sort of things, and I could hardly sleep at all. Through our journey
      I was everywhere on the watch. I don&rsquo;t know why, but it came before
      me like a real event, that my father would suddenly leave me and I should
      find myself with the Count where I could not get away from him. I thought
      God was warning me: my mother&rsquo;s voice was in my soul. It was dark
      when we reached Prague, and though the strange bunches of lamps were lit
      it was difficult to distinguish faces as we drove along the street. My
      father chose to sit outside&mdash;he was always smoking now&mdash;and I
      watched everything in spite of the darkness. I do believe I could see
      better then than I ever did before: the strange clearness within seemed to
      have got outside me. It was not my habit to notice faces and figures much
      in the street; but this night I saw every one; and when we passed before a
      great hotel I caught sight only of a back that was passing in&mdash;the
      light of the great bunch of lamps a good way off fell on it. I knew it&mdash;before
      the face was turned, as it fell into shadow, I knew who it was. Help came
      to me. I feel sure help came. I did not sleep that night. I put on my
      plainest things&mdash;the cloak and hat I have worn ever since; and I sat
      watching for the light and the sound of the doors being unbarred. Some one
      rose early&mdash;at four o&rsquo;clock, to go to the railway. That gave me
      courage. I slipped out, with my little bag under my cloak, and none
      noticed me. I had been a long while attending to the railway guide that I
      might learn the way to England; and before the sun had risen I was in the
      train for Dresden. Then I cried for joy. I did not know whether my money
      would last out, but I trusted. I could sell the things in my bag, and the
      little rings in my ears, and I could live on bread only. My only terror
      was lest my father should follow me. But I never paused. I came on, and
      on, and on, only eating bread now and then. When I got to Brussels I saw
      that I should not have enough money, and I sold all that I could sell; but
      here a strange thing happened. Putting my hand into the pocket of my
      cloak, I found a half-napoleon. Wondering and wondering how it came there,
      I remembered that on the way from Cologne there was a young workman
      sitting against me. I was frightened at every one, and did not like to be
      spoken to. At first he tried to talk, but when he saw that I did not like
      it, he left off. It was a long journey; I ate nothing but a bit of bread,
      and he once offered me some of the food he brought in, but I refused it. I
      do believe it was he who put that bit of gold in my pocket. Without it I
      could hardly have got to Dover, and I did walk a good deal of the way from
      Dover to London. I knew I should look like a miserable beggar-girl. I
      wanted not to look very miserable, because if I found my mother it would
      grieve her to see me so. But oh, how vain my hope was that she would be
      there to see me come! As soon as I set foot in London, I began to ask for
      Lambeth and Blackfriars Bridge, but they were a long way off, and I went
      wrong. At last I got to Blackfriars Bridge and asked for Colman Street.
      People shook their heads. None knew it. I saw it in my mind&mdash;our
      doorsteps, and the white tiles hung in the windows, and the large brick
      building opposite with wide doors. But there was nothing like it. At last
      when I asked a tradesman where the Coburg Theatre and Colman Street were,
      he said, &lsquo;Oh, my little woman, that&rsquo;s all done away with. The
      old streets have been pulled down; everything is new.&rsquo; I turned away
      and felt as if death had laid a hand on me. He said: &lsquo;Stop, stop!
      young woman; what is it you&rsquo;re wanting with Colman Street, eh?&rsquo;
      meaning well, perhaps. But his tone was what I could not bear; and how
      could I tell him what I wanted? I felt blinded and bewildered with a
      sudden shock. I suddenly felt that I was very weak and weary, and yet
      where could I go? for I looked so poor and dusty, and had nothing with me&mdash;I
      looked like a street-beggar. And I was afraid of all places where I could
      enter. I lost my trust. I thought I was forsaken. It seemed that I had
      been in a fever of hope&mdash;delirious&mdash;all the way from Prague: I
      thought that I was helped, and I did nothing but strain my mind forward
      and think of finding my mother; and now&mdash;there I stood in a strange
      world. All who saw me would think ill of me, and I must herd with beggars.
      I stood on the bridge and looked along the river. People were going on to
      a steamboat. Many of them seemed poor, and I felt as if it would be a
      refuge to get away from the streets; perhaps the boat would take me where
      I could soon get into a solitude. I had still some pence left, and I
      bought a loaf when I went on the boat. I wanted to have a little time and
      strength to think of life and death. How could I live? And now again it
      seemed that if ever I were to find my mother again, death was the way to
      her. I ate, that I might have strength to think. The boat set me down at a
      place along the river&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where&mdash;and it was late
      in the evening. I found some large trees apart from the road, and I sat
      down under them that I might rest through the night. Sleep must have soon
      come to me, and when I awoke it was morning. The birds were singing, and
      the dew was white about me, I felt chill and oh, so lonely! I got up and
      walked and followed the river a long way and then turned back again. There
      was no reason why I should go anywhere. The world about me seemed like a
      vision that was hurrying by while I stood still with my pain. My thoughts
      were stronger than I was; they rushed in and forced me to see all my life
      from the beginning; ever since I was carried away from my mother I had
      felt myself a lost child taken up and used by strangers, who did not care
      what my life was to me, but only what I could do for them. It seemed all a
      weary wandering and heart-loneliness&mdash;as if I had been forced to go
      to merrymakings without the expectation of joy. And now it was worse. I
      was lost again, and I dreaded lest any stranger should notice me and speak
      to me. I had a terror of the world. None knew me; all would mistake me. I
      had seen so many in my life who made themselves glad with scorning, and
      laughed at another&rsquo;s shame. What could I do? This life seemed to be
      closing in upon me with a wall of fire&mdash;everywhere there was
      scorching that made me shrink. The high sunlight made me shrink. And I
      began to think that my despair was the voice of God telling me to die. But
      it would take me long to die of hunger. Then I thought of my people, how
      they had been driven from land to land and been afflicted, and multitudes
      had died of misery in their wandering&mdash;was I the first? And in the
      wars and troubles when Christians were cruelest, our fathers had sometimes
      slain their children and afterward themselves: it was to save them from
      being false apostates. That seemed to make it right for me to put an end
      to my life; for calamity had closed me in too, and I saw no pathway but to
      evil. But my mind got into war with itself, for there were contrary things
      in it. I knew that some had held it wrong to hasten their own death,
      though they were in the midst of flames; and while I had some strength
      left it was a longing to bear if I ought to bear&mdash;else where was the
      good of all my life? It had not been happy since the first years: when the
      light came every morning I used to think, &lsquo;I will bear it.&rsquo;
      But always before I had some hope; now it was gone. With these thoughts I
      wandered and wandered, inwardly crying to the Most High, from whom I
      should not flee in death more than in life&mdash;though I had no strong
      faith that He cared for me. The strength seemed departing from my soul;
      deep below all my cries was the feeling that I was alone and forsaken. The
      more I thought the wearier I got, till it seemed I was not thinking at
      all, but only the sky and the river and the Eternal God were in my soul.
      And what was it whether I died or lived? If I lay down to die in the
      river, was it more than lying down to sleep?&mdash;for there too I
      committed my soul&mdash;I gave myself up. I could not bear memories any
      more; I could only feel what was present in me&mdash;it was all one
      longing to cease from my weary life, which seemed only a pain outside the
      great peace that I might enter into. That was how it was. When the evening
      came and the sun was gone, it seemed as if that was all I had to wait for.
      And a new strength came into me to will what I would do. You know what I
      did. I was going to die. You know what happened&mdash;did he not tell you?
      Faith came to me again; I was not forsaken. He told you how he found me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Meyrick gave no audible answer, but pressed her lips against Mirah&rsquo;s
      forehead.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just a pearl; the mud has only washed her,&rdquo; was
      the fervid little woman&rsquo;s closing commentary when, <i>tete-à-tete</i>
      with Deronda in the back parlor that evening, she had conveyed Mirah&rsquo;s
      story to him with much vividness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your feeling about a search for this mother?&rdquo; said
      Deronda. &ldquo;Have you no fears? I have, I confess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I believe the mother&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick,
      with rapid decisiveness; &ldquo;or <i>was</i> good. She may be dead&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      my fear. A good woman, you may depend: you may know it by the scoundrel
      the father is. Where did the child get her goodness from? Wheaten flour
      has to be accounted for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda was rather disappointed at this answer; he had wanted a
      confirmation of his own judgment, and he began to put in demurrers. The
      argument about the mother would not apply to the brother; and Mrs. Meyrick
      admitted that the brother might be an ugly likeness of the father. Then,
      as to advertising, if the name was Cohen, you might as well advertise for
      two undescribed terriers; and here Mrs. Meyrick helped him, for the idea
      of an advertisement, already mentioned to Mirah, had roused the poor child&rsquo;s
      terror; she was convinced that her father would see it&mdash;he saw
      everything in the papers. Certainly there were safer means than
      advertising; men might be set to work whose business it was to find
      missing persons; but Deronda wished Mrs. Meyrick to feel with him that it
      would be wiser to wait, before seeking a dubious&mdash;perhaps a
      deplorable result; especially as he was engaged to go abroad the next week
      for a couple of months. If a search were made, he would like to be at
      hand, so that Mrs. Meyrick might not be unaided in meeting any
      consequences&mdash;supposing that she would generously continue to watch
      over Mirah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should be very jealous of any one who took the task from us,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Meyrick. &ldquo;She will stay under my roof; there is Hans&rsquo;s
      old room for her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she be content to wait?&rdquo; said Deronda, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No trouble there. It is not her nature to run into planning and
      devising: only to submit. See how she submitted to that father! It was a
      wonder to herself how she found the will and contrivance to run away from
      him. About finding her mother, her only notion now is to trust; since you
      were sent to save her and we are good to her, she trusts that her mother
      will be found in the same unsought way. And when she is talking I catch
      her feeling like a child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Meyrick hoped that the sum Deronda put into her hands as a provision
      for Mirah&rsquo;s wants was more than would be needed; after a little
      while Mirah would perhaps like to occupy herself as the other girls did,
      and make herself independent. Deronda pleaded that she must need a long
      rest. &ldquo;Oh, yes; we will hurry nothing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rely upon it, she shall be taken tender care of. If you like to
      give me your address abroad, I will write to let you know how we get on.
      It is not fair that we should have all the pleasure of her salvation to
      ourselves. And besides, I want to make believe that I am doing something
      for you as well as for Mirah.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is no make-believe. What should I have done without you last
      night? Everything would have gone wrong. I shall tell Hans that the best
      of having him for a friend is, knowing his mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After that they joined the girls in the other room, where Mirah was seated
      placidly, while the others were telling her what they knew about Mr.
      Deronda&mdash;his goodness to Hans, and all the virtues that Hans had
      reported of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate burns a pastille before his portrait every day,&rdquo; said
      Mab. &ldquo;And I carry his signature in a little black-silk bag round my
      neck to keep off the cramp. And Amy says the multiplication-table in his
      name. We must all do something extra in honor of him, now he has brought
      you to us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he is too great a person to want anything,&rdquo; said
      Mirah, smiling at Mab, and appealing to the graver Amy. &ldquo;He is
      perhaps very high in the world?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very much above us in rank,&rdquo; said Amy. &ldquo;He is
      related to grand people. I dare say he leans on some of the satin cushions
      we prick our fingers over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad he is of high rank,&rdquo; said Mirah, with her usual
      quietness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, why are you glad of that?&rdquo; said Amy, rather suspicious
      of this sentiment, and on the watch for Jewish peculiarities which had not
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have always disliked men of high rank before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Deronda is not so very high,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;He
      need not hinder us from thinking ill of the whole peerage and baronetage
      if we like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered, Mirah rose with the same look of grateful reverence that
      she had lifted to him the evening before: impossible to see a creature
      freer at once from embarrassment and boldness. Her theatrical training had
      left no recognizable trace; probably her manners had not much changed
      since she played the forsaken child at nine years of age; and she had
      grown up in her simplicity and truthfulness like a little flower-seed that
      absorbs the chance confusion of its surrounding into its own definite
      mould of beauty. Deronda felt that he was making acquaintance with
      something quite new to him in the form of womanhood. For Mirah was not
      childlike from ignorance: her experience of evil and trouble was deeper
      and stranger than his own. He felt inclined to watch her and listen to her
      as if she had come from a far off shore inhabited by a race different from
      our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for that very reason he made his visit brief with his usual activity
      of imagination as to how his conduct might affect others, he shrank from
      what might seem like curiosity or the assumption of a right to know as
      much as he pleased of one to whom he had done a service. For example, he
      would have liked to hear her sing, but he would have felt the expression
      of such a wish to be rudeness in him&mdash;since she could not refuse, and
      he would all the while have a sense that she was being treated like one
      whose accomplishments were to be ready on demand. And whatever reverence
      could be shown to woman, he was bent on showing to this girl. Why? He gave
      himself several good reasons; but whatever one does with a strong
      unhesitating outflow of will has a store of motive that it would be hard
      to put into words. Some deeds seem little more than interjections which
      give vent to the long passion of a life.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Deronda soon took his farewell for the two months during which he
      expected to be absent from London, and in a few days he was on his way
      with Sir Hugo and Lady Mallinger to Leubronn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had fulfilled his intention of telling them about Mirah. The baronet
      was decidedly of opinion that the search for the mother and brother had
      better be let alone. Lady Mallinger was much interested in the poor girl,
      observing that there was a society for the conversion of the Jews, and
      that it was to be hoped Mirah would embrace Christianity; but perceiving
      that Sir Hugo looked at her with amusement, she concluded that she had
      said something foolish. Lady Mallinger felt apologetically about herself
      as a woman who had produced nothing but daughters in a case where sons
      were required, and hence regarded the apparent contradictions of the world
      as probably due to the weakness of her own understanding. But when she was
      much puzzled, it was her habit to say to herself, &ldquo;I will ask
      Daniel.&rdquo; Deronda was altogether a convenience in the family; and Sir
      Hugo too, after intending to do the best for him, had begun to feel that
      the pleasantest result would be to have this substitute for a son always
      ready at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the history of Deronda, so far as he knew it, up to the time of
      that visit to Leubronn in which he saw Gwendolen Harleth at the
      gaming-table.

      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    It is a common sentence that Knowledge is power; but who hath duly
    considered or set forth the power of Ignorance? Knowledge slowly
    builds up what Ignorance in an hour pulls down. Knowledge, through
    patient and frugal centuries, enlarges discovery and makes record of
    it; Ignorance, wanting its day&rsquo;s dinner, lights a fire with the
    record, and gives a flavor to its one roast with the burned souls of
    many generations. Knowledge, instructing the sense, refining and
    multiplying needs, transforms itself into skill and makes life various
    with a new six days&rsquo; work; comes Ignorance drunk on the seventh, with
    a firkin of oil and a match and an easy &ldquo;Let there not be,&rdquo; and the
    many-colored creation is shriveled up in blackness. Of a truth,
    Knowledge is power, but it is a power reined by scruple, having a
    conscience of what must be and what may be; whereas Ignorance is a
    blind giant who, let him but wax unbound, would make it a sport to
    seize the pillars that hold up the long-wrought fabric of human good,
    and turn all the places of joy dark as a buried Babylon. And looking
    at life parcel-wise, in the growth of a single lot, who having a
    practiced vision may not see that ignorance of the true bond between
    events, and false conceit of means whereby sequences may be
    compelled&mdash;like that falsity of eyesight which overlooks the gradations of
    distance, seeing that which is afar off as if it were within a step or
    a grasp&mdash;precipitates the mistaken soul on destruction?
</pre>
    <p>
      It was half-past ten in the morning when Gwendolen Harleth, after her
      gloomy journey from Leubronn, arrived at the station from which she must
      drive to Offendene. No carriage or friend was awaiting her, for in the
      telegram she had sent from Dover she had mentioned a later train, and in
      her impatience of lingering at a London station she had set off without
      picturing what it would be to arrive unannounced at half an hour&rsquo;s
      drive from home&mdash;at one of those stations which have been fixed on
      not as near anywhere, but as equidistant from everywhere. Deposited as a
      <i>femme sole</i> with her large trunks, and having to wait while a
      vehicle was being got from the large-sized lantern called the Railway Inn,
      Gwendolen felt that the dirty paint in the waiting-room, the dusty
      decanter of flat water, and the texts in large letters calling on her to
      repent and be converted, were part of the dreary prospect opened by her
      family troubles; and she hurried away to the outer door looking toward the
      lane and fields. But here the very gleams of sunshine seemed melancholy,
      for the autumnal leaves and grass were shivering, and the wind was turning
      up the feathers of a cock and two croaking hens which had doubtless parted
      with their grown-up offspring and did not know what to do with themselves.
      The railway official also seemed without resources, and his innocent
      demeanor in observing Gwendolen and her trunks was rendered intolerable by
      the cast in his eye; especially since, being a new man, he did not know
      her, and must conclude that she was not very high in the world. The
      vehicle&mdash;a dirty old barouche&mdash;was within sight, and was being
      slowly prepared by an elderly laborer. Contemptible details these, to make
      part of a history; yet the turn of most lives is hardly to be accounted
      for without them. They are continually entering with cumulative force into
      a mood until it gets the mass and momentum of a theory or a motive. Even
      philosophy is not quite free from such determining influences; and to be
      dropped solitary at an ugly, irrelevant-looking spot, with a sense of no
      income on the mind, might well prompt a man to discouraging speculation on
      the origin of things and the reason of a world where a subtle thinker
      found himself so badly off. How much more might such trifles tell on a
      young lady equipped for society with a fastidious taste, an Indian shawl
      over her arm, some twenty cubic feet of trunks by her side, and a mortal
      dislike to the new consciousness of poverty which was stimulating her
      imagination of disagreeables? At any rate they told heavily on poor
      Gwendolen, and helped to quell her resistant spirit. What was the good of
      living in the midst of hardships, ugliness, and humiliation? This was the
      beginning of being at home again, and it was a sample of what she had to
      expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was the theme on which her discontent rung its sad changes during her
      slow drive in the uneasy barouche, with one great trunk squeezing the meek
      driver, and the other fastened with a rope on the seat in front of her.
      Her ruling vision all the way from Leubronn had been that the family would
      go abroad again; for of course there must be some little income left&mdash;her
      mamma did not mean that they would have literally nothing. To go to a dull
      place abroad and live poorly, was the dismal future that threatened her:
      she had seen plenty of poor English people abroad and imagined herself
      plunged in the despised dullness of their ill-plenished lives, with Alice,
      Bertha, Fanny and Isabel all growing up in tediousness around her, while
      she advanced toward thirty and her mamma got more and more melancholy. But
      she did not mean to submit, and let misfortune do what it would with her:
      she had not yet quite believed in the misfortune; but weariness and
      disgust with this wretched arrival had begun to affect her like an
      uncomfortable waking, worse than the uneasy dreams which had gone before.
      The self-delight with which she had kissed her image in the glass had
      faded before the sense of futility in being anything whatever&mdash;charming,
      clever, resolute&mdash;what was the good of it all? Events might turn out
      anyhow, and men were hateful. Yes, men were hateful. But in these last
      hours, a certain change had come over their meaning. It is one thing to
      hate stolen goods, and another thing to hate them the more because their
      being stolen hinders us from making use of them. Gwendolen had begun to be
      angry with Grandcourt for being what had hindered her from marrying him,
      angry with him as the cause of her present dreary lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the slow drive was nearly at an end, and the lumbering vehicle coming
      up the avenue was within sight of the windows. A figure appearing under
      the portico brought a rush of new and less selfish feeling in Gwendolen,
      and when springing from the carriage she saw the dear beautiful face with
      fresh lines of sadness in it, she threw her arms round her mother&rsquo;s
      neck, and for the moment felt all sorrows only in relation to her mother&rsquo;s
      feeling about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind, of course, were the sad faces of the four superfluous girls, each,
      poor thing&mdash;like those other many thousand sisters of us all&mdash;having
      her peculiar world which was of no importance to any one else, but all of
      them feeling Gwendolen&rsquo;s presence to be somehow a relenting of
      misfortune: where Gwendolen was, something interesting would happen; even
      her hurried submission to their kisses, and &ldquo;Now go away, girls,&rdquo;
      carried the sort of comfort which all weakness finds in decision and
      authoritativeness. Good Miss Merry, whose air of meek depression, hitherto
      held unaccountable in a governess affectionately attached to the family,
      was now at the general level of circumstances, did not expect any
      greeting, but busied herself with the trunks and the coachman&rsquo;s pay;
      while Mrs. Davilow and Gwendolen hastened up-stairs and shut themselves in
      the black and yellow bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, mamma dear,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, tenderly pressing
      her handkerchief against the tears that were rolling down Mrs. Davilow&rsquo;s
      cheeks. &ldquo;Never mind. I don&rsquo;t mind. I will do something. I will
      be something. Things will come right. It seemed worse because I was away.
      Come now! you must be glad because I am here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen felt every word of that speech. A rush of compassionate
      tenderness stirred all her capability of generous resolution; and the
      self-confident projects which had vaguely glanced before her during her
      journey sprang instantaneously into new definiteness. Suddenly she seemed
      to perceive how she could be &ldquo;something.&rdquo; It was one of her
      best moments, and the fond mother, forgetting everything below that tide
      mark, looked at her with a sort of adoration. She said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, my good, good darling! I can be happy, if you can!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But later in the day there was an ebb; the old slippery rocks, the old
      weedy places reappeared. Naturally, there was a shrinking of courage as
      misfortune ceased to be a mere announcement, and began to disclose itself
      as a grievous tyrannical inmate. At first&mdash;that ugly drive at an end&mdash;it
      was still Offendene that Gwendolen had come home to, and all surroundings
      of immediate consequence to her were still there to secure her personal
      ease; the roomy stillness of the large solid house while she rested; all
      the luxuries of her toilet cared for without trouble to her; and a little
      tray with her favorite food brought to her in private. For she had said,
      &ldquo;Keep them all away from us to-day, mamma. Let you and me be alone
      together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Gwendolen came down into the drawing-room, fresh as a newly-dipped
      swan, and sat leaning against the cushions of the settee beside her mamma,
      their misfortune had not yet turned its face and breath upon her. She felt
      prepared to hear everything, and began in a tone of deliberate intention,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you thought of doing, exactly, mamma?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, the next thing to be done is to move away from this
      house. Mr. Haynes most fortunately is as glad to have it now as he would
      have been when we took it. Lord Brackenshaw&rsquo;s agent is to arrange
      everything with him to the best advantage for us: Bazley, you know; not at
      all an ill-natured man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help thinking that Lord Brackenshaw would let you stay
      here rent-free, mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, whose talents had not been
      applied to business so much as to discernment of the admiration excited by
      her charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, Lord Brackenshaw is in Scotland, and knows nothing
      about us. Neither your uncle nor I would choose to apply to him. Besides,
      what could we do in this house without servants, and without money to warm
      it? The sooner we are out the better. We have nothing to carry but our
      clothes, you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean to go abroad, then?&rdquo; said Gwendolen. After
      all, this is what she had familiarized her mind with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, dear, no. How could we travel? You never did learn anything
      about income and expenses,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, trying to smile, and
      putting her hand on Gwendolen&rsquo;s as she added, mournfully, &ldquo;that
      makes it so much harder for you, my pet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where are we to go?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a trace of
      sharpness in her tone. She felt a new current of fear passing through her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all decided. A little furniture is to be got in from the
      rectory&mdash;all that can be spared.&rdquo; Mrs. Davilow hesitated. She
      dreaded the reality for herself less than the shock she must give to
      Gwendolen, who looked at her with tense expectancy, but was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Sawyer&rsquo;s Cottage we are to go to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, Gwendolen remained silent, paling with anger&mdash;justifiable
      anger, in her opinion. Then she said with haughtiness,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is impossible. Something else than that ought to have been
      thought of. My uncle ought not to allow that. I will not submit to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sweet child, what else could have been thought of? Your uncle, I
      am sure, is as kind as he can be: but he is suffering himself; he has his
      family to bring up. And do you quite understand? You must remember&mdash;we
      have nothing. We shall have absolutely nothing except what he and my
      sister give us. They have been as wise and active as possible, and we must
      try to earn something. I and the girls are going to work a table-cloth
      border for the Ladies&rsquo; Charity at Winchester, and a communion cloth
      that the parishioners are to present to Pennicote Church.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow went into these details timidly: but how else was she to
      bring the fact of their position home to this poor child who, alas! must
      submit at present, whatever might be in the background for her? and she
      herself had a superstition that there must be something better in the
      background.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely somewhere else than Sawyer&rsquo;s Cottage might have
      been found,&rdquo; Gwendolen persisted&mdash;taken hold of (as if in a
      nightmare) by the image of this house where an exciseman had lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, dear. You know houses are scarce, and we may be
      thankful to get anything so private. It is not so very bad. There are two
      little parlors and four bedrooms. You shall sit alone whenever you like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The ebb of sympathetic care for her mamma had gone so low just now, that
      Gwendolen took no notice of these deprecatory words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot conceive that all your property is gone at once, mamma.
      How can you be sure in so short a time? It is not a week since you wrote
      to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first news came much earlier, dear. But I would not spoil your
      pleasure till it was quite necessary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how vexatious!&rdquo; said Gwendolen, coloring with fresh
      anger. &ldquo;If I had known, I could have brought home the money I had
      won: and for want of knowing, I stayed and lost it. I had nearly two
      hundred pounds, and it would have done for us to live on a little while,
      till I could carry out some plan.&rdquo; She paused an instant and then
      added more impetuously, &ldquo;Everything has gone against me. People have
      come near me only to blight me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the &ldquo;people&rdquo; she was including Deronda. If he had not
      interfered in her life she would have gone to the gaming-table again with
      a few napoleons, and might have won back her losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must resign ourselves to the will of Providence, my child,&rdquo;
      said poor Mrs. Davilow, startled by this revelation of the gambling, but
      not daring to say more. She felt sure that &ldquo;people&rdquo; meant
      Grandcourt, about whom her lips were sealed. And Gwendolen answered
      immediately,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t resign myself. I shall do what I can against it.
      What is the good of calling the people&rsquo;s wickedness Providence? You
      said in your letter it was Mr. Lassman&rsquo;s fault we had lost our
      money. Has he run away with it all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear, you don&rsquo;t understand. There were great
      speculations: he meant to gain. It was all about mines and things of that
      sort. He risked too much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t call that Providence: it was his improvidence with
      our money, and he ought to be punished. Can&rsquo;t we go to law and
      recover our fortune? My uncle ought to take measures, and not sit down by
      such wrongs. We ought to go to law.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, law can never bring back money lost in that way.
      Your uncle says it is milk spilled upon the ground. Besides, one must have
      a fortune to get any law: there is no law for people who are ruined. And
      our money has only gone along with other people&rsquo;s. We are not the
      only sufferers: others have to resign themselves besides us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t resign myself to live at Sawyer&rsquo;s Cottage
      and see you working for sixpences and shillings because of that. I shall
      not do it. I shall do what is more befitting our rank and education.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure your uncle and all of us will approve of that, dear, and
      admire you the more for it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, glad of an
      unexpected opening for speaking on a difficult subject. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      mean that you should resign yourself to worse when anything better offered
      itself. Both your uncle and aunt have felt that your abilities and
      education were a fortune for you, and they have already heard of something
      within your reach.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that, mamma?&rdquo; some of Gwendolen&rsquo;s anger gave
      way to interest, and she was not without romantic conjectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two situations that offer themselves. One is in a bishop&rsquo;s
      family, where there are three daughters, and the other is in quite a high
      class of school; and in both, your French, and music, and dancing&mdash;and
      then your manners and habits as a lady, are exactly what is wanted. Each
      is a hundred a year&mdash;and&mdash;just for the present,&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs.
      Davilow had become frightened and hesitating,&mdash;&ldquo;to save you
      from the petty, common way of living that we must go to&mdash;you would
      perhaps accept one of the two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! be like Miss Graves at Madame Meunier&rsquo;s? No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, myself, that Dr. Monpert&rsquo;s would be more suitable.
      There could be no hardship in a bishop&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, mamma. There are hardships everywhere for a governess.
      And I don&rsquo;t see that it would be pleasanter to be looked down on in
      a bishop&rsquo;s family than in any other. Besides, you know very well I
      hate teaching. Fancy me shut up with three awkward girls something like
      Alice! I would rather emigrate than be a governess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What it precisely was to emigrate, Gwendolen was not called on to explain.
      Mrs. Davilow was mute, seeing no outlet, and thinking with dread of the
      collision that might happen when Gwendolen had to meet her uncle and aunt.
      There was an air of reticence in Gwendolen&rsquo;s haughty, resistant
      speeches which implied that she had a definite plan in reserve; and her
      practical ignorance continually exhibited, could not nullify the mother&rsquo;s
      belief in the effectiveness of that forcible will and daring which had
      held mastery over herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some ornaments, mamma, and I could sell them,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen. &ldquo;They would make a sum: I want a little sum&mdash;just to
      go on with. I dare say Marshall, at Wanchester, would take them: I know he
      showed me some bracelets once that he said he had bought from a lady.
      Jocosa might go and ask him. Jocosa is going to leave us, of course. But
      she might do that first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would do anything she could, poor, dear soul. I have not told
      you yet&mdash;she wanted me to take all her savings&mdash;her three
      hundred pounds. I tell her to set up a little school. It will be hard for
      her to go into a new family now she has been so long with us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, recommend her for the bishop&rsquo;s daughters,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, with a sudden gleam of laughter in her face. &ldquo;I am sure
      she will do better than I should.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do take care not to say such things to your uncle,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow. &ldquo;He will be hurt at your despising what he has exerted
      himself about. But I dare say you have something else in your mind that he
      might not disapprove, if you consulted him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some one else I want to consult first. Are the Arrowpoints
      at Quetcham still, and is Herr Klesmer there? But I daresay you know
      nothing about it, poor, dear mamma. Can Jeffries go on horseback with a
      note?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, Jeffries is not here, and the dealer has taken the
      horses. But some one could go for us from Leek&rsquo;s farm. The
      Arrowpoints are at Quetcham, I know. Miss Arrowpoint left her card the
      other day: I could not see her. But I don&rsquo;t know about Herr Klesmer.
      Do you want to send before to-morrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as soon as possible. I will write a note,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you be thinking of, Gwen?&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow,
      relieved in the midst of her wonderment by signs of alacrity and better
      humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind what, there&rsquo;s a dear, good mamma,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, reseating herself a moment to give atoning caresses.
      &ldquo;I mean to do something. Never mind what until it is all settled.
      And then you shall be comforted. The dear face!&mdash;it is ten years
      older in these three weeks. Now, now, now! don&rsquo;t cry&rdquo;&mdash;Gwendolen,
      holding her mamma&rsquo;s head with both hands, kissed the trembling
      eyelids. &ldquo;But mind you don&rsquo;t contradict me or put hindrances
      in my way. I must decide for myself. I cannot be dictated to by my uncle
      or any one else. My life is my own affair. And I think&rdquo;&mdash;here
      her tone took an edge of scorn&mdash;&ldquo;I think I can do better for
      you than let you live in Sawyer&rsquo;s Cottage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In uttering this last sentence Gwendolen again rose, and went to a desk
      where she wrote the following note to Klesmer:,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Miss Harleth presents her compliments to Herr Klesmer, and ventures
    to request of him the very great favor that he will call upon her, if
    possible, to-morrow. Her reason for presuming so far on his kindness
    is of a very serious nature. Unfortunate family circumstances have
    obliged her to take a course in which she can only turn for advice to
    the great knowledge and judgment of Herr Klesmer.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray get this sent to Quetcham at once, mamma,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, as she addressed the letter. &ldquo;The man must be told to
      wait for an answer. Let no time be lost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment, the absorbing purpose was to get the letter dispatched;
      but when she had been assured on this point, another anxiety arose and
      kept her in a state of uneasy excitement. If Klesmer happened not to be at
      Quetcham, what could she do next? Gwendolen&rsquo;s belief in her star, so
      to speak, had had some bruises. Things had gone against her. A splendid
      marriage which presented itself within reach had shown a hideous flaw. The
      chances of roulette had not adjusted themselves to her claims; and a man
      of whom she knew nothing had thrust himself between her and her
      intentions. The conduct of those uninteresting people who managed the
      business of the world had been culpable just in the points most injurious
      to her in particular. Gwendolen Harleth, with all her beauty and conscious
      force, felt the close threats of humiliation: for the first time the
      conditions of this world seemed to her like a hurrying roaring crowd in
      which she had got astray, no more cared for and protected than a myriad of
      other girls, in spite of its being a peculiar hardship to her. If Klesmer
      were not at Quetcham&mdash;that would be all of a piece with the rest: the
      unwelcome negative urged itself as a probability, and set her brain
      working at desperate alternatives which might deliver her from Sawyer&rsquo;s
      Cottage or the ultimate necessity of &ldquo;taking a situation,&rdquo; a
      phrase that summed up for her the disagreeables most wounding to her
      pride, most irksome to her tastes; at least so far as her experience
      enabled her to imagine disagreeables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Klesmer might be there, and Gwendolen thought of the result in that
      case with a hopefulness which even cast a satisfactory light over her
      peculiar troubles, as what might well enter into the biography of
      celebrities and remarkable persons. And if she had heard her immediate
      acquaintances cross-examined as to whether they thought her remarkable,
      the first who said &ldquo;No&rdquo; would have surprised her.

      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  We please our fancy with ideal webs
  Of innovation, but our life meanwhile
  Is in the loom, where busy passion plies
  The shuttle to and fro, and gives our deeds
  The accustomed pattern.
</pre>
    <p>
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s note, coming &ldquo;pat betwixt too early and too late,&rdquo;
      was put into Klesmer&rsquo;s hands just when he was leaving Quetcham, and
      in order to meet her appeal to his kindness he, with some inconvenience to
      himself spent the night at Wanchester. There were reasons why he would not
      remain at Quetcham.
    </p>
    <p>
      That magnificent mansion, fitted with regard to the greatest expense, had
      in fact became too hot for him, its owners having, like some great
      politicians, been astonished at an insurrection against the established
      order of things, which we plain people after the event can perceive to
      have been prepared under their very noses.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were as usual many guests in the house, and among them one in whom
      Miss Arrowpoint foresaw a new pretender to her hand: a political man of
      good family who confidently expected a peerage, and felt on public grounds
      that he required a larger fortune to support the title properly. Heiresses
      vary, and persons interested in one of them beforehand are prepared to
      find that she is too yellow or too red, tall and toppling or short and
      square, violent and capricious or moony and insipid; but in every case it
      is taken for granted that she will consider herself an appendage to her
      fortune, and marry where others think her fortunes ought to go. Nature,
      however, not only accommodates herself ill to our favorite practices by
      making &ldquo;only children&rdquo; daughters, but also now and then endows
      the misplaced daughter with a clear head and a strong will. The
      Arrowpoints had already felt some anxiety owing to these endowments of
      their Catherine. She would not accept the view of her social duty which
      required her to marry a needy nobleman or a commoner on the ladder toward
      nobility; and they were not without uneasiness concerning her persistence
      in declining suitable offers. As to the possibility of her being in love
      with Klesmer they were not at all uneasy&mdash;a very common sort of
      blindness. For in general mortals have a great power of being astonished
      at the presence of an effect toward which they have done everything, and
      at the absence of an effect toward which they had done nothing but desire
      it. Parents are astonished at the ignorance of their sons, though they
      have used the most time-honored and expensive means of securing it;
      husbands and wives are mutually astonished at the loss of affection which
      they have taken no pains to keep; and all of us in our turn are apt to be
      astonished that our neighbors do not admire us. In this way it happens
      that the truth seems highly improbable. The truth is something different
      from the habitual lazy combinations begotten by our wishes. The
      Arrowpoints&rsquo; hour of astonishment was come.
    </p>
    <p>
      When there is a passion between an heiress and a proud
      independent-spirited man, it is difficult for them to come to an
      understanding; but the difficulties are likely to be overcome unless the
      proud man secures himself by a constant <i>alibi</i>. Brief meetings after
      studied absence are potent in disclosure: but more potent still is
      frequent companionship, with full sympathy in taste and admirable
      qualities on both sides; especially where the one is in the position of
      teacher and the other is delightedly conscious of receptive ability which
      also gives the teacher delight. The situation is famous in history, and
      has no less charm now than it had in the days of Abelard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this kind of comparison had not occurred to the Arrowpoints when they
      first engaged Klesmer to come down to Quetcham. To have a first-rate
      musician in your house is a privilege of wealth; Catherine&rsquo;s musical
      talent demanded every advantage; and she particularly desired to use her
      quieter time in the country for more thorough study. Klesmer was not yet a
      Liszt, understood to be adored by ladies of all European countries with
      the exception of Lapland: and even with that understanding it did not
      follow that he would make proposals to an heiress. No musician of honor
      would do so. Still less was it conceivable that Catherine would give him
      the slightest pretext for such daring. The large check that Mr. Arrowpoint
      was to draw in Klesmer&rsquo;s name seemed to make him as safe an inmate
      as a footman. Where marriage is inconceivable, a girl&rsquo;s sentiments
      are safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer was eminently a man of honor, but marriages rarely begin with
      formal proposals, and moreover, Catherine&rsquo;s limit of the conceivable
      did not exactly correspond with her mother&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outsiders might have been more apt to think that Klesmer&rsquo;s position
      was dangerous for himself if Miss Arrowpoint had been an acknowledged
      beauty; not taking into account that the most powerful of all beauty is
      that which reveals itself after sympathy and not before it. There is a
      charm of eye and lip which comes with every little phrase that certifies
      delicate perception or fine judgment, with every unostentatious word or
      smile that shows a heart awake to others; and no sweep of garment or turn
      of figure is more satisfying than that which enters as a restoration of
      confidence that one person is present on whom no intention will be lost.
      What dignity of meaning goes on gathering in frowns and laughs which are
      never observed in the wrong place; what suffused adorableness in a human
      frame where there is a mind that can flash out comprehension and hands
      that can execute finely! The more obvious beauty, also adorable sometimes&mdash;one
      may say it without blasphemy&mdash;begins by being an apology for folly,
      and ends like other apologies in becoming tiresome by iteration; and that
      Klesmer, though very susceptible to it, should have a passionate
      attachment to Miss Arrowpoint, was no more a paradox than any other
      triumph of a manifold sympathy over a monotonous attraction. We object
      less to be taxed with the enslaving excess of our passions than with our
      deficiency in wider passion; but if the truth were known, our reputed
      intensity is often the dullness of not knowing what else to do with
      ourselves. Tannhäuser, one suspects, was a knight of ill-furnished
      imagination, hardly of larger discourse than a heavy Guardsman; Merlin had
      certainly seen his best days, and was merely repeating himself, when he
      fell into that hopeless captivity; and we know that Ulysses felt so
      manifest an <i>ennui</i> under similar circumstances that Calypso herself
      furthered his departure. There is indeed a report that he afterward left
      Penelope; but since she was habitually absorbed in worsted work, and it
      was probably from her that Telemachus got his mean, pettifogging
      disposition, always anxious about the property and the daily consumption
      of meat, no inference can be drawn from this already dubious scandal as to
      the relation between companionship and constancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer was as versatile and fascinating as a young Ulysses on a
      sufficient acquaintance&mdash;one whom nature seemed to have first made
      generously and then to have added music as a dominant power using all the
      abundant rest, and, as in Mendelssohn, finding expression for itself not
      only in the highest finish of execution, but in that fervor of creative
      work and theoretic belief which pierces the whole future of a life with
      the delight of congruous devoted purpose. His foibles of arrogance and
      vanity did not exceed such as may be found in the best English families;
      and Catherine Arrowpoint had no corresponding restlessness to clash with
      his: notwithstanding her native kindliness she was perhaps too coolly firm
      and self-sustained. But she was one of those satisfactory creatures whose
      intercourse has the charm of discovery; whose integrity of faculty and
      expression begets a wish to know what they will say on all subjects or how
      they will perform whatever they undertake; so that they end by raising not
      only a continual expectation but a continual sense of fulfillment&mdash;the
      systole and diastole of blissful companionship. In such cases the outward
      presentment easily becomes what the image is to the worshipper. It was not
      long before the two became aware that each was interesting to the other;
      but the &ldquo;how far&rdquo; remained a matter of doubt. Klesmer did not
      conceive that Miss Arrowpoint was likely to think of him as a possible
      lover, and she was not accustomed to think of herself as likely to stir
      more than a friendly regard, or to fear the expression of more from any
      man who was not enamored of her fortune. Each was content to suffer some
      unshared sense of denial for the sake of loving the other&rsquo;s society
      a little too well; and under these conditions no need had been felt to
      restrict Klesmer&rsquo;s visits for the last year either in country or in
      town. He knew very well that if Miss Arrowpoint had been poor he would
      have made ardent love to her instead of sending a storm through the piano,
      or folding his arms and pouring out a hyperbolical tirade about something
      as impersonal as the north pole; and she was not less aware that if it had
      been possible for Klesmer to wish for her hand she would have found
      overmastering reasons for giving it to him. Here was the safety of full
      cups, which are as secure from overflow as the half-empty, always
      supposing no disturbance. Naturally, silent feeling had not remained at
      the same point any more than the stealthly dial-hand, and in the present
      visit to Quetcham, Klesmer had begun to think that he would not come
      again; while Catherine was more sensitive to his frequent <i>brusquerie</i>,
      which she rather resented as a needless effort to assert his footing of
      superior in every sense except the conventional.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile enters the expectant peer, Mr. Bult, an esteemed party man who,
      rather neutral in private life, had strong opinions concerning the
      districts of the Niger, was much at home also in Brazils, spoke with
      decision of affairs in the South Seas, was studious of his Parliamentary
      and itinerant speeches, and had the general solidity and suffusive
      pinkness of a healthy Briton on the central table-land of life. Catherine,
      aware of a tacit understanding that he was an undeniable husband for an
      heiress, had nothing to say against him but that he was thoroughly
      tiresome to her. Mr. Bult was amiably confident, and had no idea that his
      insensibility to counterpoint could ever be reckoned against him. Klesmer
      he hardly regarded in the light of a serious human being who ought to have
      a vote; and he did not mind Miss Arrowpoint&rsquo;s addiction to music any
      more than her probable expenses in antique lace. He was consequently a
      little amazed at an after-dinner outburst of Klesmer&rsquo;s on the lack
      of idealism in English politics, which left all mutuality between distant
      races to be determined simply by the need of a market; the crusades, to
      his mind, had at least this excuse, that they had a banner of sentiment
      round which generous feelings could rally: of course, the scoundrels
      rallied too, but what then? they rally in equal force round your
      advertisement van of &ldquo;Buy cheap, sell dear.&rdquo; On this theme
      Klesmer&rsquo;s eloquence, gesticulatory and other, went on for a little
      while like stray fireworks accidentally ignited, and then sank into
      immovable silence. Mr. Bult was not surprised that Klesmer&rsquo;s
      opinions should be flighty, but was astonished at his command of English
      idiom and his ability to put a point in a way that would have told at a
      constituents&rsquo; dinner&mdash;to be accounted for probably by his being
      a Pole, or a Czech, or something of that fermenting sort, in a state of
      political refugeeism which had obliged him to make a profession of his
      music; and that evening in the drawing-room he for the first time went up
      to Klesmer at the piano, Miss Arrowpoint being near, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea before that you were a political man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer&rsquo;s only answer was to fold his arms, put out his nether lip,
      and stare at Mr. Bult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been used to public speaking. You speak uncommonly
      well, though I don&rsquo;t agree with you. From what you said about
      sentiment, I fancy you are a Panslavist.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; my name is Elijah. I am the Wandering Jew,&rdquo; said Klesmer,
      flashing a smile at Miss Arrowpoint, and suddenly making a mysterious,
      wind-like rush backward and forward on the piano. Mr. Bult felt this
      buffoonery rather offensive and Polish, but&mdash;Miss Arrowpoint being
      there&mdash;did not like to move away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herr Klesmer has cosmopolitan ideas,&rdquo; said Miss Arrowpoint,
      trying to make the best of the situation. &ldquo;He looks forward to a
      fusion of races.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Mr. Bult, willing to be gracious.
      &ldquo;I was sure he had too much talent to be a mere musician.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sir, you are under some mistake there,&rdquo; said Klesmer,
      firing up. &ldquo;No man has too much talent to be a musician. Most men
      have too little. A creative artist is no more a mere musician than a great
      statesman is a mere politician. We are not ingenious puppets, sir, who
      live in a box and look out on the world only when it is gaping for
      amusement. We help to rule the nations and make the age as much as any
      other public men. We count ourselves on level benches with legislators.
      And a man who speaks effectively through music is compelled to something
      more difficult than parliamentary eloquence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With the last word Klesmer wheeled from the piano and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Arrowpoint colored, and Mr. Bult observed, with his usual phlegmatic
      stolidity, &ldquo;Your pianist does not think small beer of himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herr Klesmer is something more than a pianist,&rdquo; said Miss
      Arrowpoint, apologetically. &ldquo;He is a great musician in the fullest
      sense of the word. He will rank with Schubert and Mendelssohn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you ladies understand these things,&rdquo; said Mr. Bult, none
      the less convinced that these things were frivolous because Klesmer had
      shown himself a coxcomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine, always sorry when Klesmer gave himself airs, found an
      opportunity the next day in the music-room to say, &ldquo;Why were you so
      heated last night with Mr. Bult? He meant no harm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish me to be complaisant to him?&rdquo; said Klesmer, rather
      fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is hardly worth your while to be other than civil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find no difficulty in tolerating him, then?&mdash;you have a
      respect for a political platitudinarian as insensible as an ox to
      everything he can&rsquo;t turn into political capital. You think his
      monumental obtuseness suited to the dignity of the English gentleman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that I acted without dignity, and you are offended with
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are slightly nearer the truth,&rdquo; said Catherine,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I had better put my burial-clothes in my portmanteau and set
      off at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that. If I have to bear your criticism of my
      operetta, you should not mind my criticism of your impatience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do mind it. You would have wished me to take his ignorant
      impertinence about a &lsquo;mere musician&rsquo; without letting him know
      his place. I am to hear my gods blasphemed as well as myself insulted. But
      I beg pardon. It is impossible you should see the matter as I do. Even you
      can&rsquo;t understand the wrath of the artist: he is of another caste for
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Catherine, with some betrayal of feeling.
      &ldquo;He is of a caste to which I look up&mdash;a caste above mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer, who had been seated at a table looking over scores, started up
      and walked to a little distance, from which he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is finely felt&mdash;I am grateful. But I had better go, all
      the same. I have made up my mind to go, for good and all. You can get on
      exceedingly well without me: your operetta is on wheels&mdash;it will go
      of itself. And your Mr. Bull&rsquo;s company fits me &lsquo;wie die Faust
      ins Auge.&rsquo; I am neglecting my engagements. I must go off to St.
      Petersburg.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You agree with me that I had better go?&rdquo; said Klesmer, with
      some irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; if that is what your business and feeling prompt. I have
      only to wonder that you have consented to give us so much of your time in
      the last year. There must be treble the interest to you anywhere else. I
      have never thought of you consenting to come here as anything else than a
      sacrifice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I make the sacrifice?&rdquo; said Klesmer, going to seat
      himself at the piano, and touching the keys so as to give with the
      delicacy of an echo in the far distance a melody which he had set to Heine&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;Ich hab&rsquo; dich geliebet und liebe dich noch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the mystery,&rdquo; said Catherine, not wanting to affect
      anything, but from mere agitation. From the same cause she was tearing a
      piece of paper into minute morsels, as if at a task of utmost
      multiplication imposed by a cruel fairy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can conceive no motive?&rdquo; said Klesmer, folding his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None that seems in the least probable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall tell you. It is because you are to me the chief woman
      in the world&mdash;the throned lady whose colors I carry between my heart
      and my armor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine&rsquo;s hands trembled so much that she could no longer tear the
      paper: still less could her lips utter a word. Klesmer went on,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This would be the last impertinence in me, if I meant to found
      anything upon it. That is out of the question. I meant no such thing. But
      you once said it was your doom to suspect every man who courted you of
      being an adventurer, and what made you angriest was men&rsquo;s imputing
      to you the folly of believing that they courted you for your own sake. Did
      you not say so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; was the answer, in a low murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a bitter word. Well, at least one man who has seen women as
      plenty as flowers in May has lingered about you for your own sake. And
      since he is one whom you can never marry, you will believe him. There is
      an argument in favor of some other man. But don&rsquo;t give yourself for
      a meal to a minotaur like Bult. I shall go now and pack. I shall make my
      excuses to Mrs. Arrowpoint.&rdquo; Klesmer rose as he ended, and walked
      quickly toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take this heap of manuscript,&rdquo; then said Catherine,
      suddenly making a desperate effort. She had risen to fetch the heap from
      another table. Klesmer came back, and they had the length of the folio
      sheets between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I not marry the man who loves me, if I love him?&rdquo;
      said Catherine. To her the effort was something like the leap of a woman
      from the deck into the lifeboat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be too hard&mdash;impossible&mdash;you could not carry it
      through. I am not worth what you would have to encounter. I will not
      accept the sacrifice. It would be thought a <i>mésalliance</i> for you and
      I should be liable to the worst accusations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the accusations you are afraid of? I am afraid of nothing but
      that we should miss the passing of our lives together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The decisive word had been spoken: there was no doubt concerning the end
      willed by each: there only remained the way of arriving at it, and
      Catherine determined to take the straightest possible. She went to her
      father and mother in the library, and told them that she had promised to
      marry Klesmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Arrowpoint&rsquo;s state of mind was pitiable. Imagine Jean Jacques,
      after his essay on the corrupting influence of the arts, waking up among
      children of nature who had no idea of grilling the raw bone they offered
      him for breakfast with the primitive couvert of a flint knife; or Saint
      Just, after fervidly denouncing all recognition of pre-eminence, receiving
      a vote of thanks for the unbroken mediocrity of his speech, which
      warranted the dullest patriots in delivering themselves at equal length.
      Something of the same sort befell the authoress of &ldquo;Tasso,&rdquo;
      when what she had safely demanded of the dead Leonora was enacted by her
      own Catherine. It is hard for us to live up to our own eloquence, and keep
      pace with our winged words, while we are treading the solid earth and are
      liable to heavy dining. Besides, it has long been understood that the
      proprieties of literature are not those of practical life. Mrs. Arrowpoint
      naturally wished for the best of everything. She not only liked to feel
      herself at a higher level of literary sentiment than the ladies with whom
      she associated; she wished not to be behind them in any point of social
      consideration. While Klesmer was seen in the light of a patronized
      musician, his peculiarities were picturesque and acceptable: but to see
      him by a sudden flash in the light of her son-in-law gave her a burning
      sense of what the world would say. And the poor lady had been used to
      represent her Catherine as a model of excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the first shock she forgot everything but her anger, and snatched at
      any phrase that would serve as a weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Klesmer has presumed to offer himself to you, your father shall
      horsewhip him off the premises. Pray, speak, Mr. Arrowpoint.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The father took his cigar from his mouth, and rose to the occasion by
      saying, &ldquo;This will never do, Cath.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Arrowpoint; &ldquo;who in their senses ever
      thought it would do? You might as well say poisoning and strangling will
      not do. It is a comedy you have got up, Catherine. Else you are mad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite sane and serious, mamma, and Herr Klesmer is not to
      blame. He never thought of my marrying him. I found out that he loved me,
      and loving him, I told him I would marry him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave that unsaid, Catherine,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint,
      bitterly. &ldquo;Every one else will say that for you. You will be a
      public fable. Every one will say that you must have made an offer to a man
      who has been paid to come to the house&mdash;who is nobody knows what&mdash;a
      gypsy, a Jew, a mere bubble of the earth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, mamma,&rdquo; said Catherine, indignant in her turn.
      &ldquo;We all know he is a genius&mdash;as Tasso was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those times were not these, nor is Klesmer Tasso,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Arrowpoint, getting more heated. &ldquo;There is no sting in <i>that</i>
      sarcasm, except the sting of undutifulness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to hurt you, mamma. But I will not give up the happiness
      of my life to ideas that I don&rsquo;t believe in and customs I have no
      respect for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lost all sense of duty, then? You have forgotten that you
      are our only child&mdash;that it lies with you to place a great property
      in the right hands?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the right hands? My grandfather gained the property in
      trade.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Arrowpoint, <i>will</i> you sit by and hear this without
      speaking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a gentleman, Cath. We expect you to marry a gentleman,&rdquo;
      said the father, exerting himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a man connected with the institutions of this country,&rdquo;
      said the mother. &ldquo;A woman in your position has serious duties. Where
      duty and inclination clash, she must follow duty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny that,&rdquo; said Catherine, getting colder in
      proportion to her mother&rsquo;s heat. &ldquo;But one may say very true
      things and apply them falsely. People can easily take the sacred word duty
      as a name for what they desire any one else to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your parent&rsquo;s desire makes no duty for you, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, within reason. But before I give up the happiness of my life&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catherine, Catherine, it will not be your happiness,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Arrowpoint, in her most raven-like tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what seems to me my happiness&mdash;before I give it up, I
      must see some better reason than the wish that I should marry a nobleman,
      or a man who votes with a party that he may be turned into a nobleman. I
      feel at liberty to marry the man I love and think worthy, unless some
      higher duty forbids.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it does, Catherine, though you are blinded and cannot see
      it. It is a woman&rsquo;s duty not to lower herself. You are lowering
      yourself. Mr. Arrowpoint, will you tell your daughter what is her duty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must see, Catherine, that Klesmer is not the man for you,&rdquo;
      said Mr. Arrowpoint. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t do at the head of estates. He
      has a deuced foreign look&mdash;is an unpractical man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t see what that has to do with it, papa. The
      land of England has often passed into the hands of foreigners&mdash;Dutch
      soldiers, sons of foreign women of bad character:&mdash;if our land were
      sold to-morrow it would very likely pass into the hands of some foreign
      merchant on &lsquo;Change. It is in everybody&rsquo;s mouth that
      successful swindlers may buy up half the land in the country. How can I
      stem that tide?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will never do to argue about marriage, Cath,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Arrowpoint. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use getting up the subject like a
      parliamentary question. We must do as other people do. We must think of
      the nation and the public good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any public good concerned here, papa,&rdquo; said
      Catherine. &ldquo;Why is it to be expected of any heiress that she should
      carry the property gained in trade into the hands of a certain class? That
      seems to be a ridiculous mishmash of superannuated customs and false
      ambition. I should call it a public evil. People had better make a new
      sort of public good by changing their ambitions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is mere sophistry, Catherine,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint.
      &ldquo;Because you don&rsquo;t wish to marry a nobleman, you are not
      obliged to marry a mountebank or a charlatan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand the application of such words, mamma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I dare say not,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Arrowpoint, with
      significant scorn. &ldquo;You have got to a pitch at which we are not
      likely to understand each other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be done, Cath,&rdquo; said Mr. Arrowpoint, wishing
      to substitute a better-humored reasoning for his wife&rsquo;s impetuosity.
      &ldquo;A man like Klesmer can&rsquo;t marry such a property as yours. It
      can&rsquo;t be done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly will not be done,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint,
      imperiously. &ldquo;Where is the man? Let him be fetched.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot fetch him to be insulted,&rdquo; said Catherine. &ldquo;Nothing
      will be achieved by that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you would wish him to know that in marrying you he will
      not marry your fortune,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; if it were so, I should wish him to know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you had better fetch him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine only went into the music-room and said, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; She
      felt no need to prepare Klesmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herr Klesmer,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint, with a rather
      contemptuous stateliness, &ldquo;it is unnecessary to repeat what has
      passed between us and our daughter. Mr. Arrowpoint will tell you our
      resolution.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your marrying is out of the question,&rdquo; said Mr. Arrowpoint,
      rather too heavily weighted with his task, and standing in an
      embarrassment unrelieved by a cigar. &ldquo;It is a wild scheme
      altogether. A man has been called out for less.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have taken a base advantage of our confidence,&rdquo; burst in
      Mrs. Arrowpoint, unable to carry out her purpose and leave the burden of
      speech to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer made a low bow in silent irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pretension is ridiculous. You had better give it up and leave
      the house at once,&rdquo; continued Mr. Arrowpoint. He wished to do
      without mentioning the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can give up nothing without reference to your daughter&rsquo;s
      wish,&rdquo; said Klesmer. &ldquo;My engagement is to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is useless to discuss the question,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint.
      &ldquo;We shall never consent to the marriage. If Catherine disobeys us we
      shall disinherit her. You will not marry her fortune. It is right you
      should know that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, her fortune has been the only thing I have had to regret
      about her. But I must ask her if she will not think the sacrifice greater
      than I am worthy of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no sacrifice to me,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;except that
      I am sorry to hurt my father and mother. I have always felt my fortune to
      be a wretched fatality of my life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to defy us, then?&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to marry Herr Klesmer,&rdquo; said Catherine, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had better not count on our relenting,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Arrowpoint, whose manners suffered from that impunity in insult which has
      been reckoned among the privileges of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Klesmer, &ldquo;certain reasons forbid me to
      retort. But understand that I consider it out of the power of either of
      you, or of your fortune, to confer on me anything that I value. My rank as
      an artist is of my own winning, and I would not exchange it for any other.
      I am able to maintain your daughter, and I ask for no change in my life
      but her companionship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will leave the house, however,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go at once,&rdquo; said Klesmer, bowing and quitting the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let there be no misunderstanding, mamma,&rdquo; said Catherine;
      &ldquo;I consider myself engaged to Herr Klesmer, and I intend to marry
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother turned her head away and waved her hand in sign of dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very fine,&rdquo; said Mr. Arrowpoint, when
      Catherine was gone; &ldquo;but what the deuce are we to do with the
      property?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is Harry Brendall. He can take the name.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry Brendall will get through it all in no time,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Arrowpoint, relighting his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus, with nothing settled but the determination of the lovers,
      Klesmer had left Quetcham.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Among the heirs of Art, as is the division of the promised land, each
    has to win his portion by hard fighting: the bestowal is after the
    manner of prophecy, and is a title without possession. To carry the
    map of an ungotten estate in your pocket is a poor sort of copyhold.
    And in fancy to cast his shoe over Eden is little warrant that a man
    shall ever set the sole of his foot on an acre of his own there.

    The most obstinate beliefs that mortals entertain about themselves are
    such as they have no evidence for beyond a constant, spontaneous
    pulsing of their self-satisfaction&mdash;as it were a hidden seed of
    madness, a confidence that they can move the world without precise
    notion of standing-place or lever.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray go to church, mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen the next morning.
      &ldquo;I prefer seeing Herr Klesmer alone.&rdquo; (He had written in reply
      to her note that he would be with her at eleven.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is hardly correct, I think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow,
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our affairs are too serious for us to think of such nonsensical
      rules,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, contemptuously. &ldquo;They are insulting as
      well as ridiculous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not mind Isabel sitting with you? She would be reading in
      a corner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she could not: she would bite her nails and stare. It would be
      too irritating. Trust my judgment, mamma, I must be alone. Take them all
      to church.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen had her way, of course; only that Miss Merry and two of the
      girls stayed at home, to give the house a look of habitation by sitting at
      the dining-room windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a delicious Sunday morning. The melancholy waning sunshine of
      autumn rested on the half-strown grass and came mildly through the windows
      in slanting bands of brightness over the old furniture, and the glass
      panel that reflected the furniture; over the tapestried chairs with their
      faded flower-wreaths, the dark enigmatic pictures, the superannuated organ
      at which Gwendolen had pleased herself with acting Saint Cecelia on her
      first joyous arrival, the crowd of pallid, dusty knickknacks seen through
      the open doors of the antechamber where she had achieved the wearing of
      her Greek dress as Hermione. This last memory was just now very busy in
      her; for had not Klesmer then been struck with admiration of her pose and
      expression? Whatever he had said, whatever she imagined him to have
      thought, was at this moment pointed with keenest interest for her: perhaps
      she had never before in her life felt so inwardly dependent, so
      consciously in need of another person&rsquo;s opinion. There was a new
      fluttering of spirit within her, a new element of deliberation in her
      self-estimate which had hitherto been a blissful gift of intuition. Still
      it was the recurrent burden of her inward soliloquy that Klesmer had seen
      but little of her, and any unfavorable conclusion of his must have too
      narrow a foundation. She really felt clever enough for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fill up the time she collected her volumes and pieces of music, and
      laying them on the top of the piano, set herself to classify them. Then
      catching the reflection of her movements in the glass panel, she was
      diverted to the contemplation of the image there and walked toward it.
      Dressed in black, without a single ornament, and with the warm whiteness
      of her skin set off between her light-brown coronet of hair and her
      square-cut bodice, she might have tempted an artist to try again the Roman
      trick of a statue in black, white, and tawny marble. Seeing her image
      slowly advancing, she thought &ldquo;I <i>am</i> beautiful&rdquo;&mdash;not
      exultingly, but with grave decision. Being beautiful was after all the
      condition on which she most needed external testimony. If any one objected
      to the turn of her nose or the form of her neck and chin, she had not the
      sense that she could presently show her power of attainment in these
      branches of feminine perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much time to fill up in this way before the sound of wheels,
      the loud ring, and the opening doors assured her that she was not by any
      accident to be disappointed. This slightly increased her inward flutter.
      In spite of her self-confidence, she dreaded Klesmer as part of that
      unmanageable world which was independent of her wishes&mdash;something
      vitriolic that would not cease to burn because you smiled or frowned at
      it. Poor thing! she was at a higher crisis of her woman&rsquo;s fate than
      in her last experience with Grandcourt. The questioning then, was whether
      she should take a particular man as a husband. The inmost fold of her
      questioning now was whether she need take a husband at all&mdash;whether
      she could not achieve substantially for herself and know gratified
      ambition without bondage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer made his most deferential bow in the wide doorway of the
      antechamber&mdash;showing also the deference of the finest gray kerseymere
      trousers and perfect gloves (the &lsquo;masters of those who know&rsquo;
      are happily altogether human). Gwendolen met him with unusual gravity, and
      holding out her hand said, &ldquo;It is most kind of you to come, Herr
      Klesmer. I hope you have not thought me presumptuous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took your wish as a command that did me honor,&rdquo; said
      Klesmer, with answering gravity. He was really putting by his own affairs
      in order to give his utmost attention to what Gwendolen might have to say;
      but his temperament was still in a state of excitation from the events of
      yesterday, likely enough to give his expressions a more than usually
      biting edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen for once was under too great a strain of feeling to remember
      formalities. She continued standing near the piano, and Klesmer took his
      stand near the other end of it with his back to the light and his terribly
      omniscient eyes upon her. No affectation was of use, and she began without
      delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to consult you, Herr Klesmer. We have lost all our fortune;
      we have nothing. I must get my own bread, and I desire to provide for my
      mamma, so as to save her from any hardship. The only way I can think of&mdash;and
      I should like it better than anything&mdash;is to be an actress&mdash;to
      go on the stage. But, of course, I should like to take a high position,
      and I thought&mdash;if you thought I could&rdquo;&mdash;here Gwendolen
      became a little more nervous&mdash;&ldquo;it would be better for me to be
      a singer&mdash;to study singing also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer put down his hat upon the piano, and folded his arms as if to
      concentrate himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Gwendolen resumed, turning from pale to pink and
      back again&mdash;&ldquo;I know that my method of singing is very
      defective; but I have been ill taught. I could be better taught; I could
      study. And you will understand my wish:&mdash;to sing and act too, like
      Grisi, is a much higher position. Naturally, I should wish to take as high
      rank as I can. And I can rely on your judgment. I am sure you will tell me
      the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen somehow had the conviction that now she made this serious appeal
      the truth would be favorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Klesmer did not speak. He drew off his gloves quickly, tossed them
      into his hat, rested his hands on his hips, and walked to the other end of
      the room. He was filled with compassion for this girl: he wanted to put a
      guard on his speech. When he turned again, he looked at her with a mild
      frown of inquiry, and said with gentle though quick utterance, &ldquo;You
      have never seen anything, I think, of artists and their lives?&mdash;I
      mean of musicians, actors, artists of that kind?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, not perturbed by a reference to this
      obvious fact in the history of a young lady hitherto well provided for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are&mdash;pardon me,&rdquo; said Klesmer, again pausing near
      the piano&mdash;&ldquo;in coming to a conclusion on such a matter as this,
      everything must be taken into consideration&mdash;you are perhaps twenty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am twenty-one,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, a slight fear rising in
      her. &ldquo;Do you think I am too old?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer pouted his under lip and shook his long fingers upward in a manner
      totally enigmatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many persons begin later than others,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      betrayed by her habitual consciousness of having valuable information to
      bestow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer took no notice, but said with more studied gentleness than ever,
      &ldquo;You have probably not thought of an artistic career until now: you
      did not entertain the notion, the longing&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;you
      did not wish yourself an actress, or anything of that sort, till the
      present trouble?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly: but I was fond of acting. I have acted; you saw me, if
      you remember&mdash;you saw me here in charades, and as Hermione,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, really fearing that Klesmer had forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he answered quickly, &ldquo;I remember&mdash;I
      remember perfectly,&rdquo; and again walked to the other end of the room.
      It was difficult for him to refrain from this kind of movement when he was
      in any argument either audible or silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen felt that she was being weighed. The delay was unpleasant. But
      she did not yet conceive that the scale could dip on the wrong side, and
      it seemed to her only graceful to say, &ldquo;I shall be very much obliged
      to you for taking the trouble to give me your advice, whatever it maybe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Harleth,&rdquo; said Klesmer, turning toward her and speaking
      with a slight increase of accent, &ldquo;I will veil nothing from you in
      this matter. I should reckon myself guilty if I put a false visage on
      things&mdash;made them too black or too white. The gods have a curse for
      him who willingly tells another the wrong road. And if I misled one who is
      so young, so beautiful&mdash;who, I trust, will find her happiness along
      the right road, I should regard myself as a&mdash;<i>Bösewicht</i>.&rdquo;
      In the last word Klesmer&rsquo;s voice had dropped to a loud whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen felt a sinking of heart under this unexpected solemnity, and
      kept a sort of fascinated gaze on Klesmer&rsquo;s face, as he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a beautiful young lady&mdash;you have been brought up in
      ease&mdash;you have done what you would&mdash;you have not said to
      yourself, &lsquo;I must know this exactly,&rsquo; &lsquo;I must understand
      this exactly,&rsquo; &lsquo;I must do this exactly,&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;in
      uttering these three terrible <i>musts</i>, Klesmer lifted up three long
      fingers in succession. &ldquo;In sum, you have not been called upon to be
      anything but a charming young lady, whom it is an impoliteness to find
      fault with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused an instant; then resting his fingers on his hips again, and
      thrusting out his powerful chin, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, with that preparation, you wish to try the life of an
      artist; you wish to try a life of arduous, unceasing work, and&mdash;uncertain
      praise. Your praise would have to be earned, like your bread; and both
      would come slowly, scantily&mdash;what do I say?&mdash;they may hardly
      come at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This tone of discouragement, which Klesmer had hoped might suffice without
      anything more unpleasant, roused some resistance in Gwendolen. With a
      slight turn of her head away from him, and an air of pique, she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that you, being an artist, would consider the life one of
      the most honorable and delightful. And if I can do nothing better?&mdash;I
      suppose I can put up with the same risks as other people do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do nothing better?&rdquo; said Klesmer, a little fired. &ldquo;No,
      my dear Miss Harleth, you could do nothing better&mdash;neither man nor
      woman could do anything better&mdash;if you could do what was best or good
      of its kind. I am not decrying the life of the true artist. I am exalting
      it. I say, it is out of the reach of any but choice organizations&mdash;natures
      framed to love perfection and to labor for it; ready, like all true
      lovers, to endure, to wait, to say, I am not yet worthy, but she&mdash;Art,
      my mistress&mdash;is worthy, and I will live to merit her. An honorable
      life? Yes. But the honor comes from the inward vocation and the hard-won
      achievement: there is no honor in donning the life as a livery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some excitement of yesterday had revived in Klesmer and hurried him into
      speech a little aloof from his immediate friendly purpose. He had wished
      as delicately as possible to rouse in Gwendolen a sense of her unfitness
      for a perilous, difficult course; but it was his wont to be angry with the
      pretensions of incompetence, and he was in danger of getting chafed.
      Conscious of this, he paused suddenly. But Gwendolen&rsquo;s chief
      impression was that he had not yet denied her the power of doing what
      would be good of its kind. Klesmer&rsquo;s fervor seemed to be a sort of
      glamor such as he was prone to throw over things in general; and what she
      desired to assure him of was that she was not afraid of some preliminary
      hardships. The belief that to present herself in public on the stage must
      produce an effect such as she had been used to feel certain of in private
      life, was like a bit of her flesh&mdash;it was not to be peeled off
      readily, but must come with blood and pain. She said, in a tone of some
      insistence;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite prepared to bear hardships at first. Of course no one
      can become celebrated all at once. And it is not necessary that every one
      should be first-rate&mdash;either actresses or singers. If you would be so
      kind as to tell me what steps I should take, I shall have the courage to
      take them. I don&rsquo;t mind going up hill. It will be easier than the
      dead level of being a governess. I will take any steps you recommend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer was convinced now that he must speak plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you the steps, not that I recommend, but that will be
      forced upon you. It is all one, so far, what your goal will be&mdash;excellence,
      celebrity, second, third rateness&mdash;it is all one. You must go to town
      under the protection of your mother. You must put yourself under training&mdash;musical,
      dramatic, theatrical:&mdash;whatever you desire to do you have to learn&rdquo;&mdash;here
      Gwendolen looked as if she were going to speak, but Klesmer lifted up his
      hand and said, decisively, &ldquo;I know. You have exercised your talents&mdash;you
      recite&mdash;you sing&mdash;from the drawing-room <i>Standpunkt</i>. My
      dear Fräulein, you must unlearn all that. You have not yet conceived what
      excellence is: you must unlearn your mistaken admirations. You must know
      what you have to strive for, and then you must subdue your mind and body
      to unbroken discipline. Your mind, I say. For you must not be thinking of
      celebrity: put that candle out of your eyes, and look only at excellence.
      You would of course earn nothing&mdash;you could get no engagement for a
      long while. You would need money for yourself and your family. But that,&rdquo;
      here Klesmer frowned and shook his fingers as if to dismiss a triviality,
      &ldquo;that could perhaps be found.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen turned pink and pale during this speech. Her pride had felt a
      terrible knife-edge, and the last sentence only made the smart keener. She
      was conscious of appearing moved, and tried to escape from her weakness by
      suddenly walking to a seat and pointing out a chair to Klesmer. He did not
      take it, but turned a little in order to face her and leaned against the
      piano. At that moment she wished that she had not sent for him: this first
      experience of being taken on some other ground than that of her social
      rank and her beauty was becoming bitter to her. Klesmer, preoccupied with
      a serious purpose, went on without change of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what sort of issue might be fairly expected from all this
      self-denial? You would ask that. It is right that your eyes should be open
      to it. I will tell you truthfully. This issue would be uncertain, and,
      most probably, would not be worth much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these relentless words Klesmer put out his lip and looked through his
      spectacles with the air of a monster impenetrable by beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s eyes began to burn, but the dread of showing weakness
      urged her to added self-control. She compelled herself to say, in a hard
      tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I want talent, or am too old to begin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer made a sort of hum, and then descended on an emphatic &ldquo;Yes!
      The desire and the training should have begun seven years ago&mdash;or a
      good deal earlier. A mountebank&rsquo;s child who helps her father to earn
      shillings when she is six years old&mdash;a child that inherits a singing
      throat from a long line of choristers and learns to sing as it learns to
      talk, has a likelier beginning. Any great achievement in acting or in
      music grows with the growth. Whenever an artist has been able to say,
      &lsquo;I came, I saw, I conquered,&rsquo; it has been at the end of
      patient practice. Genius at first is little more than a great capacity for
      receiving discipline. Singing and acting, like the fine dexterity of the
      juggler with his cups and balls, require a shaping of the organs toward a
      finer and finer certainty of effect. Your muscles&mdash;your whole frame&mdash;must
      go like a watch, true, true to a hair. That is the work of spring-time,
      before habits have been determined.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not pretend to genius,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, still feeling
      that she might somehow do what Klesmer wanted to represent as impossible.
      &ldquo;I only suppose that I might have a little talent&mdash;enough to
      improve.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny that,&rdquo; said Klesmer. &ldquo;If you had
      been put in the right track some years ago and had worked well you might
      now have made a public singer, though I don&rsquo;t think your voice would
      have counted for much in public. For the stage your personal charms and
      intelligence might then have told without the present drawback of
      inexperience&mdash;lack of discipline&mdash;lack of instruction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly Klesmer seemed cruel, but his feeling was the reverse of cruel.
      Our speech, even when we are most single-minded, can never take its line
      absolutely from one impulse; but Klesmer&rsquo;s was, as far as possible,
      directed by compassion for poor Gwendolen&rsquo;s ignorant eagerness to
      enter on a course of which he saw all the miserable details with a
      definiteness which he could not if he would have conveyed to her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen, however, was not convinced. Her self-opinion rallied, and since
      the counselor whom she had called in gave a decision of such severe
      peremptoriness, she was tempted to think that his judgment was not only
      fallible but biased. It occurred to her that a simpler and wiser step for
      her to have taken would have been to send a letter through the post to the
      manager of a London theatre, asking him to make an appointment. She would
      make no further reference to her singing; Klesmer, she saw, had set
      himself against her singing. But she felt equal to arguing with him about
      her going on the stage, and she answered in a resistant tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood, of course, that no one can be a finished actress at
      once. It may be impossible to tell beforehand whether I should succeed;
      but that seems to me a reason why I should try. I should have thought that
      I might have taken an engagement at a theatre meanwhile, so as to earn
      money and study at the same time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done, my dear Miss Harleth&mdash;I speak plainly&mdash;it
      can&rsquo;t be done. I must clear your mind of these notions which have no
      more resemblance to reality than a pantomime. Ladies and gentlemen think
      that when they have made their toilet and drawn on their gloves they are
      as presentable on the stage as in a drawing-room. No manager thinks that.
      With all your grace and charm, if you were to present yourself as an
      aspirant to the stage, a manager would either require you to pay as an
      amateur for being allowed to perform or he would tell you to go and be
      taught&mdash;trained to bear yourself on the stage, as a horse, however
      beautiful, must be trained for the circus; to say nothing of that study
      which would enable you to personate a character consistently, and animate
      it with the natural language of face, gesture, and tone. For you to get an
      engagement fit for you straight away is out of the question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really cannot understand that,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, rather
      haughtily&mdash;then, checking herself, she added in another tone&mdash;&ldquo;I
      shall be obliged to you if you will explain how it is that such poor
      actresses get engaged. I have been to the theatre several times, and I am
      sure there were actresses who seemed to me to act not at all well and who
      were quite plain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear Miss Harleth, that is the easy criticism of the buyer.
      We who buy slippers toss away this pair and the other as clumsy; but there
      went an apprenticeship to the making of them. Excuse me; you could not at
      present teach one of those actresses; but there is certainly much that she
      could teach you. For example, she can pitch her voice so as to be heard:
      ten to one you could not do it till after many trials. Merely to stand and
      move on the stage is an art&mdash;requires practice. It is understood that
      we are not now talking of a <i>comparse</i> in a petty theatre who earns
      the wages of a needle-woman. That is out of the question for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I must earn more than that,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a
      sense of wincing rather than of being refuted, &ldquo;but I think I could
      soon learn to do tolerably well all those little things you have
      mentioned. I am not so very stupid. And even in Paris, I am sure, I saw
      two actresses playing important ladies&rsquo; parts who were not at all
      ladies and quite ugly. I suppose I have no particular talent, but I <i>must</i>
      think it is an advantage, even on the stage, to be a lady and not a
      perfect fright.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, let us understand each other,&rdquo; said Klesmer, with a flash
      of new meaning. &ldquo;I was speaking of what you would have to go through
      if you aimed at becoming a real artist&mdash;if you took music and the
      drama as a higher vocation in which you would strive after excellence. On
      that head, what I have said stands fast. You would find&mdash;after your
      education in doing things slackly for one-and-twenty years&mdash;great
      difficulties in study; you would find mortifications in the treatment you
      would get when you presented yourself on the footing of skill. You would
      be subjected to tests; people would no longer feign not to see your
      blunders. You would at first only be accepted on trial. You would have to
      bear what I may call a glaring insignificance: any success must be won by
      the utmost patience. You would have to keep your place in a crowd, and
      after all it is likely you would lose it and get out of sight. If you
      determine to face these hardships and still try, you will have the dignity
      of a high purpose, even though you may have chosen unfortunately. You will
      have some merit, though you may win no prize. You have asked my judgment
      on your chances of winning. I don&rsquo;t pretend to speak absolutely; but
      measuring probabilities, my judgment is:&mdash;you will hardly achieve
      more than mediocrity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer had delivered himself with emphatic rapidity, and now paused a
      moment. Gwendolen was motionless, looking at her hands, which lay over
      each other on her lap, till the deep-toned, long-drawn &ldquo;<i>But</i>,&rdquo;
      with which he resumed, had a startling effect, and made her look at him
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;there are certainly other ideas, other dispositions with
      which a young lady may take up an art that will bring her before the
      public. She may rely on the unquestioned power of her beauty as a
      passport. She may desire to exhibit herself to an admiration which
      dispenses with skill. This goes a certain way on the stage: not in music:
      but on the stage, beauty is taken when there is nothing more commanding to
      be had. Not without some drilling, however: as I have said before,
      technicalities have in any case to be mastered. But these excepted, we
      have here nothing to do with art. The woman who takes up this career is
      not an artist: she is usually one who thinks of entering on a luxurious
      life by a short and easy road&mdash;perhaps by marriage&mdash;that is her
      most brilliant chance, and the rarest. Still, her career will not be
      luxurious to begin with: she can hardly earn her own poor bread
      independently at once, and the indignities she will be liable to are such
      as I will not speak of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desire to be independent,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, deeply stung and
      confusedly apprehending some scorn for herself in Klesmer&rsquo;s words.
      &ldquo;That was my reason for asking whether I could not get an immediate
      engagement. Of course I cannot know how things go on about theatres. But I
      thought that I could have made myself independent. I have no money, and I
      will not accept help from any one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her wounded pride could not rest without making this disclaimer. It was
      intolerable to her that Klesmer should imagine her to have expected other
      help from him than advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a hard saying for your friends,&rdquo; said Klesmer,
      recovering the gentleness of tone with which he had begun the
      conversation. &ldquo;I have given you pain. That was inevitable. I was
      bound to put the truth, the unvarnished truth, before you. I have not said&mdash;I
      will not say&mdash;you will do wrong to choose the hard, climbing path of
      an endeavoring artist. You have to compare its difficulties with those of
      any less hazardous&mdash;any more private course which opens itself to
      you. If you take that more courageous resolve I will ask leave to shake
      hands with you on the strength of our freemasonry, where we are all vowed
      to the service of art, and to serve her by helping every fellow-servant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen was silent, again looking at her hands. She felt herself very
      far away from taking the resolve that would enforce acceptance; and after
      waiting an instant or two, Klesmer went on with deepened seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where there is the duty of service there must be the duty of
      accepting it. The question is not one of personal obligation. And in
      relation to practical matters immediately affecting your future&mdash;excuse
      my permitting myself to mention in confidence an affair of my own. I am
      expecting an event which would make it easy for me to exert myself on your
      behalf in furthering your opportunities of instruction and residence in
      London&mdash;under the care, that is, of your family&mdash;without need
      for anxiety on your part. If you resolve to take art as a bread-study, you
      need only undertake the study at first; the bread will be found without
      trouble. The event I mean is my marriage&mdash;in fact&mdash;you will
      receive this as a matter of confidence&mdash;my marriage with Miss
      Arrowpoint, which will more than double such right as I have to be trusted
      by you as a friend. Your friendship will have greatly risen in value for
      <i>her</i> by your having adopted that generous labor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s face had begun to burn. That Klesmer was about to marry
      Miss Arrowpoint caused her no surprise, and at another moment she would
      have amused herself in quickly imagining the scenes that must have
      occurred at Quetcham. But what engrossed her feeling, what filled her
      imagination now, was the panorama of her own immediate future that Klesmer&rsquo;s
      words seemed to have unfolded. The suggestion of Miss Arrowpoint as a
      patroness was only another detail added to its repulsiveness: Klesmer&rsquo;s
      proposal to help her seemed an additional irritation after the humiliating
      judgment he had passed on her capabilities. His words had really bitten
      into her self-confidence and turned it into the pain of a bleeding wound;
      and the idea of presenting herself before other judges was now poisoned
      with the dread that they also might be harsh; they also would not
      recognize the talent she was conscious of. But she controlled herself, and
      rose from her seat before she made any answer. It seemed natural that she
      should pause. She went to the piano and looked absently at leaves of
      music, pinching up the corners. At last she turned toward Klesmer and
      said, with almost her usual air of proud equality, which in this interview
      had not been hitherto perceptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you sincerely, Herr Klesmer. I think I never saw any
      one so admirable as Miss Arrowpoint. And I have to thank you for every
      sort of kindness this morning. But I can&rsquo;t decide now. If I make the
      resolve you have spoken of, I will use your permission&mdash;I will let
      you know. But I fear the obstacles are too great. In any case, I am deeply
      obliged to you. It was very bold of me to ask you to take this trouble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer&rsquo;s inward remark was, &ldquo;She will never let me know.&rdquo;
      But with the most thorough respect in his manner, he said, &ldquo;Command
      me at any time. There is an address on this card which will always find me
      with little delay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had taken up his hat and was going to make his bow, Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      better self, conscious of an ingratitude which the clear-seeing Klesmer
      must have penetrated, made a desperate effort to find its way above the
      stifling layers of egoistic disappointment and irritation. Looking at him
      with a glance of the old gayety, she put out her hand, and said with a
      smile, &ldquo;If I take the wrong road, it will not be because of your
      flattery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid that you should take any road but one where you will
      find and give happiness!&rdquo; said Klesmer, fervently. Then, in foreign
      fashion, he touched her fingers lightly with his lips, and in another
      minute she heard the sound of his departing wheels getting more distant on
      the gravel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen had never in her life felt so miserable. No sob came, no passion
      of tears, to relieve her. Her eyes were burning; and the noonday only
      brought into more dreary clearness the absence of interest from her life.
      All memories, all objects, the pieces of music displayed, the open piano&mdash;the
      very reflection of herself in the glass&mdash;seemed no better than the
      packed-up shows of a departing fair. For the first time since her
      consciousness began, she was having a vision of herself on the common
      level, and had lost the innate sense that there were reasons why she
      should not be slighted, elbowed, jostled&mdash;treated like a passenger
      with a third-class ticket, in spite of private objections on her own part.
      She did not move about; the prospects begotten by disappointment were too
      oppressively preoccupying; she threw herself into the shadiest corner of a
      settee, and pressed her fingers over her burning eyelids. Every word that
      Klesmer had said seemed to have been branded into her memory, as most
      words are which bring with them a new set of impressions and make an epoch
      for us. Only a few hours before, the dawning smile of self-contentment
      rested on her lips as she vaguely imagined a future suited to her wishes:
      it seemed but the affair of a year or so for her to become the most
      approved Juliet of the time: or, if Klesmer encouraged her idea of being a
      singer, to proceed by more gradual steps to her place in the opera, while
      she won money and applause by occasional performances. Why not? At home,
      at school, among acquaintances, she had been used to have her conscious
      superiority admitted; and she had moved in a society where everything,
      from low arithmetic to high art, is of the amateur kind, politely supposed
      to fall short of perfection only because gentlemen and ladies are not
      obliged to do more than they like&mdash;otherwise they would probably give
      forth abler writings, and show themselves more commanding artists than any
      the world is at present obliged to put up with. The self-confident visions
      that had beguiled her were not of a highly exceptional kind; and she had
      at least shown some rationality in consulting the person who knew the most
      and had flattered her the least. In asking Klesmer&rsquo;s advice,
      however, she had rather been borne up by a belief in his latent admiration
      than bent on knowing anything more unfavorable that might have lain behind
      his slight objections to her singing; and the truth she had asked for,
      with an expectation that it would be agreeable, had come like a lacerating
      thong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too old&mdash;should have begun seven years ago&mdash;you will not,
      at best, achieve more than mediocrity&mdash;hard, incessant work,
      uncertain praise&mdash;bread coming slowly, scantily, perhaps not at all&mdash;mortifications,
      people no longer feigning not to see your blunders&mdash;glaring
      insignificance&rdquo;&mdash;all these phrases rankled in her; and even
      more galling was the hint that she could only be accepted on the stage as
      a beauty who hoped to get a husband. The &ldquo;indignities&rdquo; that
      she might be visited with had no very definite form for her, but the mere
      association of anything called &ldquo;indignity&rdquo; with herself,
      roused a resentful alarm. And along with the vaguer images which were
      raised by those biting words, came the precise conception of disagreeables
      which her experience enabled her to imagine. How could she take her mamma
      and the four sisters to London? if it were not possible for her to earn
      money at once? And as for submitting to be a <i>protégé</i>, and asking
      her mamma to submit with her to the humiliation of being supported by Miss
      Arrowpoint&mdash;that was as bad as being a governess; nay, worse; for
      suppose the end of all her study to be as worthless as Klesmer clearly
      expected it to be, the sense of favors received and never repaid, would
      embitter the miseries of disappointment. Klesmer doubtless had magnificent
      ideas about helping artists; but how could he know the feelings of ladies
      in such matters? It was all over: she had entertained a mistaken hope; and
      there was an end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An end of it!&rdquo; said Gwendolen, aloud, starting from her seat
      as she heard the steps and voices of her mamma and sisters coming in from
      church. She hurried to the piano and began gathering together her pieces
      of music with assumed diligence, while the expression on her pale face and
      in her burning eyes was what would have suited a woman enduring a wrong
      which she might not resent, but would probably revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my darling,&rdquo; said gentle Mrs. Davilow, entering,
      &ldquo;I see by the wheel-marks that Klesmer has been here. Have you been
      satisfied with the interview?&rdquo; She had some guesses as to its
      object, but felt timid about implying them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satisfied, mamma? oh, yes,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, in a high, hard
      tone, for which she must be excused, because she dreaded a scene of
      emotion. If she did not set herself resolutely to feign proud
      indifference, she felt that she must fall into a passionate outburst of
      despair, which would cut her mamma more deeply than all the rest of their
      calamities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle and aunt were disappointed at not seeing you,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Davilow, coming near the piano, and watching Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      movements. &ldquo;I only said that you wanted rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, in the same tone,
      turning to put away some music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not to know anything now, Gwendolen? Am I always to be in the
      dark?&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, too keenly sensitive to her daughter&rsquo;s
      manner and expression not to fear that something painful had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is really nothing to tell now, mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      in a still higher voice. &ldquo;I had a mistaken idea about something I
      could do. Herr Klesmer has undeceived me. That is all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look and speak in that way, my dear child: I cannot
      bear it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, breaking down. She felt an undefinable
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen looked at her a moment in silence, biting her inner lip; then
      she went up to her, and putting her hands on her mamma&rsquo;s shoulders,
      said, with a drop in her voice to the lowest undertone, &ldquo;Mamma, don&rsquo;t
      speak to me now. It is useless to cry and waste our strength over what can&rsquo;t
      be altered. You will live at Sawyer&rsquo;s Cottage, and I am going to the
      bishop&rsquo;s daughters. There is no more to be said. Things cannot be
      altered, and who cares? It makes no difference to any one else what we do.
      We must try not to care ourselves. We must not give way. I dread giving
      way. Help me to be quiet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow was like a frightened child under her daughter&rsquo;s face
      and voice; her tears were arrested and she went away in silence.

      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I question things but do not find
  One that will answer to my mind:
  And all the world appears unkind.&rdquo;
                             &mdash;WORDSWORTH.
</pre>
    <p>
      Gwendolen was glad that she had got through her interview with Klesmer
      before meeting her uncle and aunt. She had made up her mind now that there
      were only disagreeables before her, and she felt able to maintain a dogged
      calm in the face of any humiliation that might be proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting did not happen until the Monday, when Gwendolen went to the
      rectory with her mamma. They had called at Sawyer&rsquo;s Cottage by the
      way, and had seen every cranny of the narrow rooms in a mid-day light,
      unsoftened by blinds and curtains; for the furnishing to be done by
      gleanings from the rectory had not yet begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How <i>shall</i> you endure it, mamma?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, as
      they walked away. She had not opened her lips while they were looking
      round at the bare walls and floors, and the little garden with the
      cabbage-stalks, and the yew arbor all dust and cobwebs within. &ldquo;You
      and the four girls all in that closet of a room, with the green and yellow
      paper pressing on your eyes? And without me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be some comfort that you have not to bear it too, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were not that I must get some money, I would rather be there
      than go to be a governess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t set yourself against it beforehand, Gwendolen. If you
      go to the palace you will have every luxury about you. And you know how
      much you have always cared for that. You will not find it so hard as going
      up and down those steep narrow stairs, and hearing the crockery rattle
      through the house, and the dear girls talking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like a bad dream,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, impetuously. &ldquo;I
      cannot believe that my uncle will let you go to such a place. He ought to
      have taken some other steps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be unreasonable, dear child. What could he have done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was for him to find out. It seems to me a very extraordinary
      world if people in our position must sink in this way all at once,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, the other worlds with which she was conversant being
      constructed with a sense of fitness that arranged her own future
      agreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her temper that framed her sentences under this entirely new
      pressure of evils: she could have spoken more suitably on the vicissitudes
      in other people&rsquo;s lives, though it was never her aspiration to
      express herself virtuously so much as cleverly&mdash;a point to be
      remembered in extenuation of her words, which were usually worse than she
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, notwithstanding the keen sense of her own bruises, she was capable of
      some compunction when her uncle and aunt received her with a more
      affectionate kindness than they had ever shown before. She could not but
      be struck by the dignified cheerfulness with which they talked of the
      necessary economies in their way of living, and in the education of the
      boys. Mr. Gascoigne&rsquo;s worth of character, a little obscured by
      worldly opportunities&mdash;as the poetic beauty of women is obscured by
      the demands of fashionable dressing&mdash;showed itself to great advantage
      under this sudden reduction of fortune. Prompt and methodical, he had set
      himself not only to put down his carriage, but to reconsider his worn
      suits of clothes, to leave off meat for breakfast, to do without
      periodicals, to get Edwy from school and arrange hours of study for all
      the boys under himself, and to order the whole establishment on the
      sparest footing possible. For all healthy people economy has its
      pleasures; and the rector&rsquo;s spirit had spread through the household.
      Mrs. Gascoigne and Anna, who always made papa their model, really did not
      miss anything they cared about for themselves, and in all sincerity felt
      that the saddest part of the family losses was the change for Mrs. Davilow
      and her children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna for the first time could merge her resentment on behalf of Rex in her
      sympathy with Gwendolen; and Mrs. Gascoigne was disposed to hope that
      trouble would have a salutary effect on her niece, without thinking it her
      duty to add any bitters by way of increasing the salutariness. They had
      both been busy devising how to get blinds and curtains for the cottage out
      of the household stores; but with delicate feeling they left these matters
      in the back-ground, and talked at first of Gwendolen&rsquo;s journey, and
      the comfort it was to her mamma to have her at home again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact there was nothing for Gwendolen to take as a justification for
      extending her discontent with events to the persons immediately around
      her, and she felt shaken into a more alert attention, as if by a call to
      drill that everybody else was obeying, when her uncle began in a voice of
      firm kindness to talk to her of the efforts he had been making to get her
      a situation which would offer her as many advantages as possible. Mr.
      Gascoigne had not forgotten Grandcourt, but the possibility of further
      advances from that quarter was something too vague for a man of his good
      sense to be determined by it: uncertainties of that kind must not now
      slacken his action in doing the best he could for his niece under actual
      conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt that there was no time to be lost, Gwendolen; for a position
      in a good family where you will have some consideration is not to be had
      at a moment&rsquo;s notice. And however long we waited we could hardly
      find one where you would be better off than at Bishop Mompert&rsquo;s. I
      am known to both him and Mrs. Mompert, and that of course is an advantage
      to you. Our correspondence has gone on favorably; but I cannot be
      surprised that Mrs. Mompert wishes to see you before making an absolute
      engagement. She thinks of arranging for you to meet her at Wanchester when
      she is on her way to town. I dare say you will feel the interview rather
      trying for you, my dear; but you will have a little time to prepare your
      mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know <i>why</i> she wants to see me, uncle?&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, whose mind had quickly gone over various reasons that an
      imaginary Mrs. Mompert with three daughters might be supposed to
      entertain, reasons all of a disagreeable kind to the person presenting
      herself for inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector smiled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, my dear. She would like
      to have a more precise idea of you than my report can give. And a mother
      is naturally scrupulous about a companion for her daughters. I have told
      her you are very young. But she herself exercises a close supervision over
      her daughters&rsquo; education, and that makes her less anxious as to age.
      She is a woman of taste and also of strict principle, and objects to
      having a French person in the house. I feel sure that she will think your
      manners and accomplishments as good as she is likely to find; and over the
      religious and moral tone of the education she, and indeed the bishop
      himself, will preside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen dared not answer, but the repression of her decided dislike to
      the whole prospect sent an unusually deep flush over her face and neck,
      subsiding as quickly as it came. Anna, full of tender fears, put her
      little hand into her cousin&rsquo;s, and Mr. Gascoigne was too kind a man
      not to conceive something of the trial which this sudden change must be
      for a girl like Gwendolen. Bent on giving a cheerful view of things, he
      went on, in an easy tone of remark, not as if answering supposed
      objections,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so highly of the position, that I should have been tempted
      to try and get it for Anna, if she had been at all likely to meet Mrs.
      Mompert&rsquo;s wants. It is really a home, with a continuance of
      education in the highest sense: &lsquo;governess&rsquo; is a misnomer. The
      bishop&rsquo;s views are of a more decidedly Low Church color than my own&mdash;he
      is a close friend of Lord Grampian&rsquo;s; but, though privately strict,
      he is not by any means narrow in public matters. Indeed, he has created as
      little dislike in his diocese as any bishop on the bench. He has always
      remained friendly to me, though before his promotion, when he was an
      incumbent of this diocese, we had a little controversy about the Bible
      Society.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector&rsquo;s words were too pregnant with satisfactory meaning to
      himself for him to imagine the effect they produced in the mind of his
      niece. &ldquo;Continuance of education&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;bishop&rsquo;s
      views&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;privately strict&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Bible
      Society,&rdquo;&mdash;it was as if he had introduced a few snakes at large
      for the instruction of ladies who regarded them as all alike furnished
      with poison-bags, and, biting or stinging, according to convenience. To
      Gwendolen, already shrinking from the prospect open to her, such phrases
      came like the growing heat of a burning glass&mdash;not at all as the
      links of persuasive reflection which they formed for the good uncle. She
      began, desperately, to seek an alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was another situation, I think, mamma spoke of?&rdquo; she
      said, with determined self-mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the rector, in rather a depreciatory tone;
      &ldquo;but that is in a school. I should not have the same satisfaction in
      your taking that. It would be much harder work, you are aware, and not so
      good in any other respect. Besides, you have not an equal chance of
      getting it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear no,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gascoigne, &ldquo;it would be much
      harder for you, my dear&mdash;it would be much less appropriate. You might
      not have a bedroom to yourself.&rdquo; And Gwendolen&rsquo;s memories of
      school suggested other particulars which forced her to admit to herself
      that this alternative would be no relief. She turned to her uncle again
      and said, apparently in acceptance of his ideas,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is Mrs. Mompert likely to send for me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is rather uncertain, but she has promised not to entertain any
      other proposal till she has seen you. She has entered with much feeling
      into your position. It will be within the next fortnight, probably. But I
      must be off now. I am going to let part of my glebe uncommonly well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector ended very cheerfully, leaving the room with the satisfactory
      conviction that Gwendolen was going to adapt herself to circumstances like
      a girl of good sense. Having spoken appropriately, he naturally supposed
      that the effects would be appropriate; being accustomed, as a household
      and parish authority, to be asked to &ldquo;speak to&rdquo; refractory
      persons, with the understanding that the measure was morally coercive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a stay Henry is to us all!&rdquo; said Mrs. Gascoigne, when
      her husband had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, cordially. &ldquo;I think
      cheerfulness is a fortune in itself. I wish I had it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Rex is just like him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gascoigne. &ldquo;I must
      tell you the comfort we have had in a letter from him. I must read you a
      little bit,&rdquo; she added, taking the letter from her pocket, while
      Anna looked rather frightened&mdash;she did not know why, except that it
      had been a rule with her not to mention Rex before Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proud mother ran her eyes over the letter, seeking for sentences to
      read aloud. But apparently she had found it sown with what might seem to
      be closer allusions than she desired to the recent past, for she looked
      up, folding the letter, and saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, he tells us that our trouble has made a man of him; he
      sees a reason for any amount of work: he means to get a fellowship, to
      take pupils, to set one of his brothers going, to be everything that is
      most remarkable. The letter is full of fun&mdash;just like him. He says,
      &lsquo;Tell mother she has put out an advertisement for a jolly good
      hard-working son, in time to hinder me from taking ship; and I offer
      myself for the place.&rsquo; The letter came on Friday. I never saw my
      husband so much moved by anything since Rex was born. It seemed a gain to
      balance our loss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter, in fact, was what had helped both Mrs. Gascoigne and Anna to
      show Gwendolen an unmixed kindliness; and she herself felt very amiably
      about it, smiling at Anna, and pinching her chin, as much as to say,
      &ldquo;Nothing is wrong with you now, is it?&rdquo; She had no
      gratuitously ill-natured feeling, or egoistic pleasure in making men
      miserable. She only had an intense objection to their making her
      miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the talk turned on furniture for the cottage Gwendolen was not
      roused to show even a languid interest. She thought that she had done as
      much as could be expected of her this morning, and indeed felt at an
      heroic pitch in keeping to herself the struggle that was going on within
      her. The recoil of her mind from the only definite prospect allowed her,
      was stronger than even she had imagined beforehand. The idea of presenting
      herself before Mrs. Mompert in the first instance, to be approved or
      disapproved, came as pressure on an already painful bruise; even as a
      governess, it appeared she was to be tested and was liable to rejection.
      After she had done herself the violence to accept the bishop and his wife,
      they were still to consider whether they would accept her; it was at her
      peril that she was to look, speak, or be silent. And even when she had
      entered on her dismal task of self-constraint in the society of three
      girls whom she was bound incessantly to edify, the same process of
      inspection was to go on: there was always to be Mrs. Mompert&rsquo;s
      supervision; always something or other would be expected of her to which
      she had not the slightest inclination; and perhaps the bishop would
      examine her on serious topics. Gwendolen, lately used to the social
      successes of a handsome girl, whose lively venturesomeness of talk has the
      effect of wit, and who six weeks before would have pitied the dullness of
      the bishop rather than have been embarrassed by him, saw the life before
      her as an entrance into a penitentiary. Wild thoughts of running away to
      be an actress, in spite of Klesmer, came to her with the lure of freedom;
      but his words still hung heavily on her soul; they had alarmed her pride
      and even her maidenly dignity: dimly she conceived herself getting amongst
      vulgar people who would treat her with rude familiarity&mdash;odious men,
      whose grins and smirks would not be seen through the strong grating of
      polite society. Gwendolen&rsquo;s daring was not in the least that of the
      adventuress; the demand to be held a lady was in her very marrow; and when
      she had dreamed that she might be the heroine of the gaming-table, it was
      with the understanding that no one should treat her with the less
      consideration, or presume to look at her with irony as Deronda had done.
      To be protected and petted, and to have her susceptibilities consulted in
      every detail, had gone along with her food and clothing as matters of
      course in her life: even without any such warning as Klesmer&rsquo;s she
      could not have thought it an attractive freedom to be thrown in solitary
      dependence on the doubtful civility of strangers. The endurance of the
      episcopal penitentiary was less repulsive than that; though here too she
      would certainly never be petted or have her susceptibilities consulted.
      Her rebellion against this hard necessity which had come just to her of
      all people in the world&mdash;to her whom all circumstances had concurred
      in preparing for something quite different&mdash;was exaggerated instead
      of diminished as one hour followed another, with the imagination of what
      she might have expected in her lot and what it was actually to be. The
      family troubles, she thought, were easier for every one than for her&mdash;even
      for poor dear mamma, because she had always used herself to not enjoying.
      As to hoping that if she went to the Momperts&rsquo; and was patient a
      little while, things might get better&mdash;it would be stupid to
      entertain hopes for herself after all that had happened: her talents, it
      appeared, would never be recognized as anything remarkable, and there was
      not a single direction in which probability seemed to flatter her wishes.
      Some beautiful girls who, like her, had read romances where even plain
      governesses are centres of attraction and are sought in marriage, might
      have solaced themselves a little by transporting such pictures into their
      own future; but even if Gwendolen&rsquo;s experience had led her to dwell
      on love-making and marriage as her elysium, her heart was too much
      oppressed by what was near to her, in both the past and the future, for
      her to project her anticipations very far off. She had a world-nausea upon
      her, and saw no reason all through her life why she should wish to live.
      No religious view of trouble helped her: her troubles had in her opinion
      all been caused by other people&rsquo;s disagreeable or wicked conduct;
      and there was really nothing pleasant to be counted on in the world: that
      was her feeling; everything else she had heard said about trouble was mere
      phrase-making not attractive enough for her to have caught it up and
      repeated it. As to the sweetness of labor and fulfilled claims; the
      interest of inward and outward activity; the impersonal delights of life
      as a perpetual discovery; the dues of courage, fortitude, industry, which
      it is mere baseness not to pay toward the common burden; the supreme worth
      of the teacher&rsquo;s vocation;&mdash;these, even if they had been
      eloquently preached to her, could have been no more than faintly
      apprehended doctrines: the fact which wrought upon her was her invariable
      observation that for a lady to become a governess&mdash;to &ldquo;take a
      situation&rdquo;&mdash;was to descend in life and to be treated at best
      with a compassionate patronage. And poor Gwendolen had never dissociated
      happiness from personal pre-eminence and <i>éclat</i>. That where these
      threatened to forsake her, she should take life to be hardly worth the
      having, cannot make her so unlike the rest of us, men or women, that we
      should cast her out of our compassion; our moments of temptation to a mean
      opinion of things in general being usually dependent on some
      susceptibility about ourselves and some dullness to subjects which every
      one else would consider more important. Surely a young creature is
      pitiable who has the labyrinth of life before her and no clue&mdash;to
      whom distrust in herself and her good fortune has come as a sudden shock,
      like a rent across the path that she was treading carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her healthy frame, her irreconcilable repugnance affected her
      even physically; she felt a sort of numbness and could set about nothing;
      the least urgency, even that she should take her meals, was an irritation
      to her; the speech of others on any subject seemed unreasonable, because
      it did not include her feeling and was an ignorant claim on her. It was
      not in her nature to busy herself with the fancies of suicide to which
      disappointed young people are prone: what occupied and exasperated her was
      the sense that there was nothing for her but to live in a way she hated.
      She avoided going to the rectory again: it was too intolerable to have to
      look and talk as if she were compliant; and she could not exert herself to
      show interest about the furniture of that horrible cottage. Miss Merry was
      staying on purpose to help, and such people as Jocosa liked that sort of
      thing. Her mother had to make excuses for her not appearing, even when
      Anna came to see her. For that calm which Gwendolen had promised herself
      to maintain had changed into sick motivelessness: she thought, &ldquo;I
      suppose I shall begin to pretend by-and-by, but why should I do it now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother watched her with silent distress; and, lapsing into the habit
      of indulgent tenderness, she began to think what she imagined that
      Gwendolen was thinking, and to wish that everything should give way to the
      possibility of making her darling less miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when she was in the black and yellow bedroom and her mother was
      lingering there under the pretext of considering and arranging Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      articles of dress, she suddenly roused herself to fetch the casket which
      contained the ornaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; she began, glancing over the upper layer, &ldquo;I
      had forgotten these things. Why didn&rsquo;t you remind me of them? Do see
      about getting them sold. You will not mind about parting with them. You
      gave them all to me long ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted the upper tray and looked below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we can do without them, darling, I would rather keep them for
      you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, seating herself beside Gwendolen with a
      feeling of relief that she was beginning to talk about something. The
      usual relation between them had become reversed. It was now the mother who
      tried to cheer the daughter. &ldquo;Why, how came you to put that pocket
      handkerchief in here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the handkerchief with the corner torn off which Gwendolen had
      thrust in with the turquoise necklace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happened to be with the necklace&mdash;I was in a hurry,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, taking the handkerchief away and putting it in her pocket.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sell the necklace, mamma,&rdquo; she added, a new
      feeling having come over her about that rescue of it which had formerly
      been so offensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear, no; it was made out of your dear father&rsquo;s chain.
      And I should prefer not selling the other things. None of them are of any
      great value. All my best ornaments were taken from me long ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow colored. She usually avoided any reference to such facts
      about Gwendolen&rsquo;s step-father as that he had carried off his wife&rsquo;s
      jewelry and disposed of it. After a moment&rsquo;s pause she went on,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And these things have not been reckoned on for any expenses. Carry
      them with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be quite useless, mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, coldly.
      &ldquo;Governesses don&rsquo;t wear ornaments. You had better get me a
      gray frieze livery and a straw poke, such as my aunt&rsquo;s charity
      children wear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear, no; don&rsquo;t take that view of it. I feel sure the
      Momperts will like you the better for being graceful and elegant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at all sure what the Momperts will like me to be. It is
      enough that I am expected to be what they like,&rdquo; said Gwendolen
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is anything you would object to less&mdash;anything that
      could be done&mdash;instead of your going to the bishop&rsquo;s, do say
      so, Gwendolen. Tell me what is in your heart. I will try for anything you
      wish,&rdquo; said the mother, beseechingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep things
      away from me. Let us bear them together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mamma, there is nothing to tell. I can&rsquo;t do anything
      better. I must think myself fortunate if they will have me. I shall get
      some money for you. That is the only thing I have to think of. I shall not
      spend any money this year: you will have all the eighty pounds. I don&rsquo;t
      know how far that will go in housekeeping; but you need not stitch your
      poor fingers to the bone, and stare away all the sight that the tears have
      left in your dear eyes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen did not give any caresses with her words as she had been used to
      do. She did not even look at her mother, but was looking at the turquoise
      necklace as she turned it over her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you for your tenderness, my good darling!&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow, with tears in her eyes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t despair because there
      are clouds now. You are so young. There may be great happiness in store
      for you yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any reason for expecting it, mamma,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, in a hard tone; and Mrs. Davilow was silent, thinking as she
      had often thought before&mdash;&ldquo;What did happen between her and Mr.
      Grandcourt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>will</i> keep this necklace, mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      laying it apart and then closing the casket. &ldquo;But do get the other
      things sold, even if they will not bring much. Ask my uncle what to do
      with them. I shall certainly not use them again. I am going to take the
      veil. I wonder if all the poor wretches who have ever taken it felt as I
      do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t exaggerate evils, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can any one know that I exaggerate, when I am speaking of my
      own feeling? I did not say what any one else felt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She took out the torn handkerchief from her pocket again, and wrapped it
      deliberately round the necklace. Mrs. Davilow observed the action with
      some surprise, but the tone of her last words discouraged her from asking
      any question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; Gwendolen spoke of with an air of tragedy was
      not to be explained by the mere fact that she was going to be a governess:
      she was possessed by a spirit of general disappointment. It was not simply
      that she had a distaste for what she was called on to do: the distaste
      spread itself over the world outside her penitentiary, since she saw
      nothing very pleasant in it that seemed attainable by her even if she were
      free. Naturally her grievances did not seem to her smaller than some of
      her male contemporaries held theirs to be when they felt a profession too
      narrow for their powers, and had an <i>à priori</i> conviction that it was
      not worth while to put forth their latent abilities. Because her education
      had been less expensive than theirs, it did not follow that she should
      have wider emotions or a keener intellectual vision. Her griefs were
      feminine; but to her as a woman they were not the less hard to bear, and
      she felt an equal right to the Promethean tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the movement of mind which led her to keep the necklace, to fold it up
      in the handkerchief, and rise to put it in her <i>nécessaire</i>, where
      she had first placed it when it had been returned to her, was more
      peculiar, and what would be called less reasonable. It came from that
      streak of superstition in her which attached itself both to her confidence
      and her terror&mdash;a superstition which lingers in an intense
      personality even in spite of theory and science; any dread or hope for
      self being stronger than all reasons for or against it. Why she should
      suddenly determine not to part with the necklace was not much clearer to
      her than why she should sometimes have been frightened to find herself in
      the fields alone: she had a confused state of emotion about Deronda&mdash;was
      it wounded pride and resentment, or a certain awe and exceptional trust?
      It was something vague and yet mastering, which impelled her to this
      action about the necklace. There is a great deal of unmapped country
      within us which would have to be taken into account in an explanation of
      our gusts and storms.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    How trace the why and wherefore in a mind reduced to the barrenness of
    a fastidious egoism, in which all direct desires are dulled, and have
    dwindled from motives into a vacillating expectation of motives: a
    mind made up of moods, where a fitful impulse springs here and there
    conspicuously rank amid the general weediness? &lsquo;Tis a condition apt to
    befall a life too much at large, unmoulded by the pressure of
    obligation. <i>Nam deteriores omnes sumus licentiae</i>, or, as a more
    familiar tongue might deliver it, <i>&ldquo;As you like&rdquo; is a bad finger-post.</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      Potentates make known their intentions and affect the funds at a small
      expense of words. So when Grandcourt, after learning that Gwendolen had
      left Leubronn, incidentally pronounced that resort of fashion a beastly
      hole, worse than Baden, the remark was conclusive to Mr. Lush that his
      patron intended straightway to return to Diplow. The execution was sure to
      be slower than the intention, and, in fact, Grandcourt did loiter through
      the next day without giving any distinct orders about departure&mdash;perhaps
      because he discerned that Lush was expecting them: he lingered over his
      toilet, and certainly came down with a faded aspect of perfect distinction
      which made fresh complexions and hands with the blood in them, seem signs
      of raw vulgarity; he lingered on the terrace, in the gambling-rooms, in
      the reading-room, occupying himself in being indifferent to everybody and
      everything around him. When he met Lady Mallinger, however, he took some
      trouble&mdash;raised his hat, paused, and proved that he listened to her
      recommendation of the waters by replying, &ldquo;Yes; I heard somebody say
      how providential it was that there always happened to be springs at
      gambling places.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was a joke,&rdquo; said innocent Lady Mallinger, misled by
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s languid seriousness, &ldquo;in imitation of the old one
      about the towns and the rivers, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, perhaps,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, without change of expression.
      Lady Mallinger thought this worth telling to Sir Hugo, who said, &ldquo;Oh,
      my dear, he is not a fool. You must not suppose that he can&rsquo;t see a
      joke. He can play his cards as well as most of us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never seemed to me a very sensible man,&rdquo; said Lady
      Mallinger, in excuse of herself. She had a secret objection to meeting
      Grandcourt, who was little else to her than a large living sign of what
      she felt to be her failure as a wife&mdash;the not having presented Sir
      Hugo with a son. Her constant reflection was that her husband might fairly
      regret his choice, and if he had not been very good might have treated her
      with some roughness in consequence, gentlemen naturally disliking to be
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda, too, had a recognition from Grandcourt, for which he was not
      grateful, though he took care to return it with perfect civility. No
      reasoning as to the foundations of custom could do away with the
      early-rooted feeling that his birth had been attended with injury for
      which his father was to blame; and seeing that but for this injury
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s prospects might have been his, he was proudly resolute
      not to behave in any way that might be interpreted into irritation on that
      score. He saw a very easy descent into mean unreasoning rancor and triumph
      in others&rsquo; frustration; and being determined not to go down that
      ugly pit, he turned his back on it, clinging to the kindlier affections
      within him as a possession. Pride certainly helped him well&mdash;the
      pride of not recognizing a disadvantage for one&rsquo;s self which vulgar
      minds are disposed to exaggerate, such as the shabby equipage of poverty:
      he would not have a man like Grandcourt suppose himself envied by him. But
      there is no guarding against interpretation. Grandcourt did believe that
      Deronda, poor devil, who he had no doubt was his cousin by the father&rsquo;s
      side, inwardly winced under their mutual position; wherefore the presence
      of that less lucky person was more agreeable to him than it would
      otherwise have been. An imaginary envy, the idea that others feel their
      comparative deficiency, is the ordinary <i>cortège</i> of egoism; and his
      pet dogs were not the only beings that Grandcourt liked to feel his power
      over in making them jealous. Hence he was civil enough to exchange several
      words with Deronda on the terrace about the hunting round Diplow, and even
      said, &ldquo;You had better come over for a run or two when the season
      begins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lush, not displeased with delay, amused himself very well, partly in
      gossiping with Sir Hugo and in answering his questions about Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      affairs so far as they might affect his willingness to part with his
      interest in Diplow. Also about Grandcourt&rsquo;s personal entanglements,
      the baronet knew enough already for Lush to feel released from silence on
      a sunny autumn day, when there was nothing more agreeable to do in
      lounging promenades than to speak freely of a tyrannous patron behind his
      back. Sir Hugo willingly inclined his ear to a little good-humored
      scandal, which he was fond of calling <i>traits de moeurs</i>; but he was
      strict in keeping such communications from hearers who might take them too
      seriously. Whatever knowledge he had of his nephew&rsquo;s secrets, he had
      never spoken of it to Deronda, who considered Grandcourt a pale-blooded
      mortal, but was far from wishing to hear how the red corpuscles had been
      washed out of him. It was Lush&rsquo;s policy and inclination to gratify
      everybody when he had no reason to the contrary; and the baronet always
      treated him well, as one of those easy-handled personages who, frequenting
      the society of gentlemen, without being exactly gentlemen themselves, can
      be the more serviceable, like the second-best articles of our wardrobe,
      which we use with a comfortable freedom from anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you will let me know the turn of events,&rdquo; said Sir
      Hugo, &ldquo;if this marriage seems likely to come off after all, or if
      anything else happens to make the want of money pressing. My plan would be
      much better for him than burdening Ryelands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Lush, &ldquo;only it must not be
      urged on him&mdash;just placed in his way that the scent may tickle him.
      Grandcourt is not a man to be always led by what makes for his own
      interest; especially if you let him see that it makes for your interest
      too. I&rsquo;m attached to him, of course. I&rsquo;ve given up everything
      else for the sake of keeping by him, and it has lasted a good fifteen
      years now. He would not easily get any one else to fill my place. He&rsquo;s
      a peculiar character, is Henleigh Grandcourt, and it has been growing on
      him of late years. However, I&rsquo;m of a constant disposition, and I&rsquo;ve
      been a sort of guardian to him since he was twenty; an uncommonly
      fascinating fellow he was then, to be sure&mdash;and could be now, if he
      liked. I&rsquo;m attached to him; and it would be a good deal worse for
      him if he missed me at his elbow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Hugo did not think it needful to express his sympathy or even assent,
      and perhaps Lush himself did not expect this sketch of his motives to be
      taken as exact. But how can a man avoid himself as a subject in
      conversation? And he must make some sort of decent toilet in words, as in
      cloth and linen. Lush&rsquo;s listener was not severe: a member of
      Parliament could allow for the necessities of verbal toilet; and the
      dialogue went on without any change of mutual estimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Lush&rsquo;s easy prospect of indefinite procrastination was cut
      off the next morning by Grandcourt&rsquo;s saluting him with the question,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you making all the arrangements for our starting by the Paris
      train?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you meant to start,&rdquo; said Lush, not
      exactly taken by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have known,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, looking at the burned
      length of his cigar, and speaking in that lowered tone which was usual
      with him when he meant to express disgust and be peremptory. &ldquo;Just
      see to everything, will you? and mind no brute gets into the same carriage
      with us. And leave my P. P. C. at the Mallingers&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence they were at Paris the next day; but here Lush was
      gratified by the proposal or command that he should go straight on to
      Diplow and see that everything was right, while Grandcourt and the valet
      remained behind; and it was not until several days later that Lush
      received the telegram ordering the carriage to the Wanchester station.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had used the interim actively, not only in carrying out Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      orders about the stud and household, but in learning all he could of
      Gwendolen, and how things were going on at Offendene. What was the
      probable effect that the news of the family misfortunes would have on
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s fitful obstinacy he felt to be quite incalculable. So
      far as the girl&rsquo;s poverty might be an argument that she would accept
      an offer from him now in spite of any previous coyness, it might remove
      that bitter objection to risk a repulse which Lush divined to be one of
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s deterring motives; on the other hand, the certainty of
      acceptance was just &ldquo;the sort of thing&rdquo; to make him lapse
      hither and thither with no more apparent will than a moth. Lush had had
      his patron under close observation for many years, and knew him perhaps
      better than he knew any other subject; but to know Grandcourt was to doubt
      what he would do in any particular case. It might happen that he would
      behave with an apparent magnanimity, like the hero of a modern French
      drama, whose sudden start into moral splendor after much lying and
      meanness, leaves you little confidence as to any part of his career that
      may follow the fall of the curtain. Indeed, what attitude would have been
      more honorable for a final scene than that of declining to seek an heiress
      for her money, and determining to marry the attractive girl who had none?
      But Lush had some general certainties about Grandcourt, and one was that
      of all inward movements those of generosity were least likely to occur in
      him. Of what use, however, is a general certainty that an insect will not
      walk with his head hindmost, when what you need to know is the play of
      inward stimulus that sends him hither and thither in a network of possible
      paths? Thus Lush was much at fault as to the probable issue between
      Grandcourt and Gwendolen, when what he desired was a perfect confidence
      that they would never be married. He would have consented willingly that
      Grandcourt should marry an heiress, or that he should marry Mrs. Glasher:
      in the one match there would have been the immediate abundance that
      prospective heirship could not supply, in the other there would have been
      the security of the wife&rsquo;s gratitude, for Lush had always been Mrs.
      Glasher&rsquo;s friend; and that the future Mrs. Grandcourt should not be
      socially received could not affect his private comfort. He would not have
      minded, either, that there should be no marriage in question at all; but
      he felt himself justified in doing his utmost to hinder a marriage with a
      girl who was likely to bring nothing but trouble to her husband&mdash;not
      to speak of annoyance if not ultimate injury to her husband&rsquo;s old
      companion, whose future Mr. Lush earnestly wished to make as easy as
      possible, considering that he had well deserved such compensation for
      leading a dog&rsquo;s life, though that of a dog who enjoyed many tastes
      undisturbed, and who profited by a large establishment. He wished for
      himself what he felt to be good, and was not conscious of wishing harm to
      any one else; unless perhaps it were just now a little harm to the
      inconvenient and impertinent Gwendolen. But the easiest-humored of luxury
      and music, the toad-eater the least liable to nausea, must be expected to
      have his susceptibilities. And Mr. Lush was accustomed to be treated by
      the world in general as an apt, agreeable fellow: he had not made up his
      mind to be insulted by more than one person.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this imperfect preparation of a war policy, Lush was awaiting
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s arrival, doing little more than wondering how the
      campaign would begin. The first day Grandcourt was much occupied with the
      stables, and amongst other things he ordered a groom to put a side-saddle
      on Criterion and let him review the horse&rsquo;s paces. This marked
      indication of purpose set Lush on considering over again whether he should
      incur the ticklish consequences of speaking first, while he was still sure
      that no compromising step had been taken; and he rose the next morning
      almost resolved that if Grandcourt seemed in as good a humor as yesterday
      and entered at all into talk, he would let drop the interesting facts
      about Gwendolen and her family, just to see how they would work, and to
      get some guidance. But Grandcourt did not enter into talk, and in answer
      to a question even about his own convenience, no fish could have
      maintained a more unwinking silence. After he had read his letters he gave
      various orders to be executed or transmitted by Lush, and then thrust his
      shoulder toward that useful person, who accordingly rose to leave the
      room. But before he was out of the door Grandcourt turned his head
      slightly and gave a broken, languid &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Lush, who, it must have been observed, did
      not take his dusty puddings with a respectful air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut the door, will you? I can&rsquo;t speak into the corridor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lush closed the door, came forward, and chose to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little pause Grandcourt said, &ldquo;Is Miss Harleth at Offendene?&rdquo;
      He was quite certain that Lush had made it his business to inquire about
      her, and he had some pleasure in thinking that Lush did not want <i>him</i>
      to inquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hardly know,&rdquo; said Lush, carelessly. &ldquo;The
      family&rsquo;s utterly done up. They and the Gascoignes too have lost all
      their money. It&rsquo;s owing to some rascally banking business. The poor
      mother hasn&rsquo;t a <i>sou</i>, it seems. She and the girls have to
      huddle themselves into a little cottage like a laborer&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to me, if you please,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, in
      his lowest audible tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not amusing, and it answers no
      other purpose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Lush, more nettled than was common
      with him&mdash;the prospect before him being more than commonly
      disturbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just tell me the truth, will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no invention of mine. I have heard the story from
      several&mdash;Bazley, Brackenshaw&rsquo;s man, for one. He is getting a
      new tenant for Offendene.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that. Is Miss Harleth there, or is she not?&rdquo;
      said Grandcourt, in his former tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my soul, I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; said Lush, rather sulkily.
      &ldquo;She may have left yesterday. I heard she had taken a situation as
      governess; she may be gone to it for what I know. But if you wanted to see
      her no doubt the mother would send for her back.&rdquo; This sneer slipped
      off his tongue without strict intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send Hutchins to inquire whether she will be there tomorrow.&rdquo;
      Lush did not move. Like many persons who have thought over beforehand what
      they shall say in given cases, he was impelled by an unexpected irritation
      to say some of those prearranged things before the cases were given.
      Grandcourt, in fact, was likely to get into a scrape so tremendous that it
      was impossible to let him take the first step toward it without
      remonstrance. Lush retained enough caution to use a tone of rational
      friendliness, still he felt his own value to his patron, and was prepared
      to be daring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be as well for you to remember, Grandcourt, that you are
      coming under closer fire now. There can be none of the ordinary flirting
      done, which may mean everything or nothing. You must make up your mind
      whether you wish to be accepted; and more than that, how you would like
      being refused. Either one or the other. You can&rsquo;t be philandering
      after her again for six weeks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt said nothing, but pressed the newspaper down on his knees and
      began to light another cigar. Lush took this as a sign that he was willing
      to listen, and was the more bent on using the opportunity; he wanted, if
      possible, to find out which would be the more potent cause of hesitation&mdash;probable
      acceptance or probable refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything has a more serious look now than it had before. There is
      her family to be provided for. You could not let your wife&rsquo;s mother
      live in beggary. It will be a confoundedly hampering affair. Marriage will
      pin you down in a way you haven&rsquo;t been used to; and in point of
      money you have not too much elbow-room. And after all, what will you get
      by it? You are master over your estates, present or future, as far as
      choosing your heir goes; it&rsquo;s a pity to go on encumbering them for a
      mere whim, which you may repent of in a twelvemonth. I should be sorry to
      see you making a mess of your life in that way. If there were anything
      solid to be gained by the marriage, that would be a different affair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lush&rsquo;s tone had gradually become more and more unctuous in its
      friendliness of remonstrance, and he was almost in danger of forgetting
      that he was merely gambling in argument. When he left off, Grandcourt took
      his cigar out of his mouth, and looking steadily at the moist end while he
      adjusted the leaf with his delicate finger-tips, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew before that you had an objection to my marrying Miss
      Harleth.&rdquo; Here he made a little pause before he continued. &ldquo;But
      I never considered that a reason against it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never supposed you did,&rdquo; answered Lush, not unctuously but
      dryly. &ldquo;It was not <i>that</i> I urged as a reason. I should have
      thought it might have been a reason against it, after all your experience,
      that you would be acting like the hero of a ballad, and making yourself
      absurd&mdash;and all for what? You know you couldn&rsquo;t make up your
      mind before. It&rsquo;s impossible you can care much about her. And as for
      the tricks she is likely to play, you may judge of that from what you
      heard at Leubronn. However, what I wished to point out to you was, that
      there can be no shilly-shally now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, looking round at Lush and fixing
      him with narrow eyes; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend that there should be. I
      dare say it&rsquo;s disagreeable to you. But if you suppose I care a damn
      for that you are most stupendously mistaken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Lush, rising with his hands in his pockets,
      and feeling some latent venom still within him, &ldquo;if you have made up
      your mind!&mdash;only there&rsquo;s another aspect of the affair. I have
      been speaking on the supposition that it was absolutely certain she would
      accept you, and that destitution would have no choice. But I am not so
      sure that the young lady is to be counted on. She is kittle cattle to
      shoe, I think. And she had her reasons for running away before.&rdquo;
      Lush had moved a step or two till he stood nearly in front of Grandcourt,
      though at some distance from him. He did not feel himself much restrained
      by consequences, being aware that the only strong hold he had on his
      present position was his serviceableness; and even after a quarrel the
      want of him was likely sooner or later to recur. He foresaw that Gwendolen
      would cause him to be ousted for a time, and his temper at this moment
      urged him to risk a quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had her reasons,&rdquo; he repeated more significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had come to that conclusion before,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, with
      contemptuous irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I hardly think you know what her reasons were.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do, apparently,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, not betraying by so
      much as an eyelash that he cared for the reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and you had better know too, that you may judge of the
      influence you have over her if she swallows her reasons and accepts you.
      For my own part I would take odds against it. She saw Lydia in Cardell
      Chase and heard the whole story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt made no immediate answer, and only went on smoking. He was so
      long before he spoke that Lush moved about and looked out of the windows,
      unwilling to go away without seeing some effect of his daring move. He had
      expected that Grandcourt would tax him with having contrived the affair,
      since Mrs. Glasher was then living at Gadsmere, a hundred miles off, and
      he was prepared to admit the fact: what he cared about was that Grandcourt
      should be staggered by the sense that his intended advances must be made
      to a girl who had that knowledge in her mind and had been scared by it. At
      length Grandcourt, seeing Lush turn toward him, looked at him again and
      said, contemptuously, &ldquo;What follows?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here certainly was a &ldquo;mate&rdquo; in answer to Lush&rsquo;s &ldquo;check&rdquo;;
      and though his exasperation with Grandcourt was perhaps stronger than it
      had ever been before, it would have been idiocy to act as if any further
      move could be useful. He gave a slight shrug with one shoulder, and was
      going to walk away, when Grandcourt, turning on his seat toward the table,
      said, as quietly as if nothing had occurred, &ldquo;Oblige me by pushing
      that pen and paper here, will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No thunderous, bullying superior could have exercised the imperious spell
      that Grandcourt did. Why, instead of being obeyed, he had never been told
      to go to a warmer place, was perhaps a mystery to those who found
      themselves obeying him. The pen and paper were pushed to him, and as he
      took them he said, &ldquo;Just wait for this letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He scrawled with ease, and the brief note was quickly addressed. &ldquo;Let
      Hutchins go with it at once, will you?&rdquo; said Grandcourt, pushing the
      letter away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lush had expected, it was addressed to Miss Harleth, Offendene. When
      his irritation had cooled down he was glad there had been no explosive
      quarrel; but he felt sure that there was a notch made against him, and
      that somehow or other he was intended to pay. It was also clear to him
      that the immediate effect of his revelation had been to harden Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      previous determination. But as to the particular movements that made this
      process in his baffling mind, Lush could only toss up his chin in despair
      of a theory.

      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  He brings white asses laden with the freight
  Of Tyrian vessels, purple, gold and balm,
  To bribe my will: I&rsquo;ll bid them chase him forth,
  Nor let him breathe the taint of his surmise
  On my secure resolve.
                         Ay, &lsquo;tis secure:
  And therefore let him come to spread his freight.
  For firmness hath its appetite and craves
  The stronger lure, more strongly to resist;
  Would know the touch of gold to fling it off;
  Scent wine to feel its lip the soberer;
  Behold soft byssus, ivory, and plumes
  To say, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re fair, but I will none of them,&rdquo;
   And flout Enticement in the very face.
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Gascoigne one day came to Offendene with what he felt to be the
      satisfactory news that Mrs. Mompert had fixed Tuesday in the following
      week for her interview with Gwendolen at Wanchester. He said nothing of
      his having incidentally heard that Mr. Grandcourt had returned to Diplow;
      knowing no more than she did that Leubronn had been the goal of her
      admirer&rsquo;s journeying, and feeling that it would be unkind uselessly
      to revive the memory of a brilliant prospect under the present reverses.
      In his secret soul he thought of his niece&rsquo;s unintelligible caprice
      with regret, but he vindicated her to himself by considering that
      Grandcourt had been the first to behave oddly, in suddenly walking away
      when there had the best opportunity for crowning his marked attentions.
      The rector&rsquo;s practical judgment told him that his chief duty to his
      niece now was to encourage her resolutely to face the change in her lot,
      since there was no manifest promise of any event that would avert it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find an interest in varied experience, my dear, and I have
      no doubt you will be a more valuable woman for having sustained such a
      part as you are called to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot pretend to believe that I shall like it,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, for the first time showing her uncle some petulance. &ldquo;But
      I am quite aware that I am obliged to bear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered having submitted to his admonition on a different occasion
      when she was expected to like a very different prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your good sense will teach you to behave suitably under it,&rdquo;
      said Mr. Gascoigne, with a shade more gravity. &ldquo;I feel sure that
      Mrs. Mompert will be pleased with you. You will know how to conduct
      yourself to a woman who holds in all senses the relation of a superior to
      you. This trouble has come on you young, but that makes it in some
      respects easier, and there is a benefit in all chastisement if we adjust
      our minds to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was precisely what Gwendolen was unable to do; and after her uncle
      was gone, the bitter tears, which had rarely come during the late trouble,
      rose and fell slowly as she sat alone. Her heart denied that the trouble
      was easier because she was young. When was she to have any happiness, if
      it did not come while she was young? Not that her visions of possible
      happiness for herself were as unmixed with necessary evil as they used to
      be&mdash;not that she could still imagine herself plucking the fruits of
      life without suspicion of their core. But this general disenchantment with
      the world&mdash;nay, with herself, since it appeared that she was not made
      for easy pre-eminence&mdash;only intensified her sense of forlornness; it
      was a visibly sterile distance enclosing the dreary path at her feet, in
      which she had no courage to tread. She was in that first crisis of
      passionate youthful rebellion against what is not fitly called pain, but
      rather the absence of joy&mdash;that first rage of disappointment in life&rsquo;s
      morning, which we whom the years have subdued are apt to remember but
      dimly as part of our own experience, and so to be intolerant of its
      self-enclosed unreasonableness and impiety. What passion seems more
      absurd, when we have got outside it and looked at calamity as a collective
      risk, than this amazed anguish that I and not Thou, He or She, should be
      just the smitten one? Yet perhaps some who have afterward made themselves
      a willing fence before the breast of another, and have carried their own
      heart-wound in heroic silence&mdash;some who have made their deeds great,
      nevertheless began with this angry amazement at their own smart, and on
      the mere denial of their fantastic desires raged as if under the sting of
      wasps which reduced the universe for them to an unjust infliction of pain.
      This was nearly poor Gwendolen&rsquo;s condition. What though such a
      reverse as hers had often happened to other girls? The one point she had
      been all her life learning to care for was that it had happened to <i>her</i>:
      it was what <i>she</i> felt under Klesmer&rsquo;s demonstration that she
      was not remarkable enough to command fortune by force of will and merit;
      it was what <i>she</i> would feel under the rigors of Mrs. Mompert&rsquo;s
      constant expectation, under the dull demand that she should be cheerful
      with three Miss Momperts, under the necessity of showing herself entirely
      submissive, and keeping her thoughts to herself. To be a queen disthroned
      is not so hard as some other down-stepping: imagine one who had been made
      to believe in his own divinity finding all homage withdrawn, and himself
      unable to perform a miracle that would recall the homage and restore his
      own confidence. Something akin to this illusion and this helplessness had
      befallen the poor spoiled child, with the lovely lips and eyes and the
      majestic figure&mdash;which seemed now to have no magic in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose from the low ottoman where she had been sitting purposeless, and
      walked up and down the drawing-room, resting her elbow on one palm while
      she leaned down her cheek on the other, and a slow tear fell. She thought,
      &ldquo;I have always, ever since I was little, felt that mamma was not a
      happy woman; and now I dare say I shall be more unhappy than she has been.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind dwelt for a few moments on the picture of herself losing her
      youth and ceasing to enjoy&mdash;not minding whether she did this or that:
      but such picturing inevitably brought back the image of her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor mamma! it will be still worse for her now. I can get a little
      money for her&mdash;that is all I shall care about now.&rdquo; And then
      with an entirely new movement of her imagination, she saw her mother
      getting quite old and white, and herself no longer young but faded, and
      their two faces meeting still with memory and love, and she knowing what
      was in her mother&rsquo;s mind&mdash;&ldquo;Poor Gwen too is sad and faded
      now&rdquo;&mdash;and then, for the first time, she sobbed, not in anger,
      but with a sort of tender misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was toward the door, and she saw her mother enter. She barely saw
      that; for her eyes were large with tears, and she pressed her handkerchief
      against them hurriedly. Before she took it away she felt her mother&rsquo;s
      arms round her, and this sensation, which seemed a prolongation of her
      inward vision, overcame her will to be reticent; she sobbed anew in spite
      of herself, as they pressed their cheeks together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow had brought something in her hand which had already caused
      her an agitating anxiety, and she dared not speak until her darling had
      become calmer. But Gwendolen, with whom weeping had always been a painful
      manifestation to be resisted, if possible, again pressed her handkerchief
      against her eyes, and, with a deep breath, drew her head backward and
      looked at her mother, who was pale and tremulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was nothing, mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, thinking that her
      mother had been moved in this way simply by finding her in distress.
      &ldquo;It is all over now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Davilow had withdrawn her arms, and Gwendolen perceived a letter
      in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that letter?&mdash;worse news still?&rdquo; she asked, with
      a touch of bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you will think it, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow, keeping the letter in her hand. &ldquo;You will hardly guess
      where it comes from.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to guess anything,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, rather
      impatiently, as if a bruise were being pressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is addressed to you, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen gave the slightest perceptible toss of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes from Diplow,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, giving her the
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew Grandcourt&rsquo;s indistinct handwriting, and her mother was not
      surprised to see her blush deeply; but watching her as she read, and
      wondering much what was the purport of the letter, she saw the color die
      out. Gwendolen&rsquo;s lips even were pale as she turned the open note
      toward her mother. The words were few and formal:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grandcourt presents his compliments to Miss Harleth, and begs to know
      whether he may be permitted to call at Offendene tomorrow after two and to
      see her alone. Mr. Grandcourt has just returned from Leubronn, where he
      had hoped to find Miss Harleth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow read, and then looked at her daughter inquiringly, leaving
      the note in her hand. Gwendolen let it fall to the floor, and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be answered, darling,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, timidly.
      &ldquo;The man waits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen sank on the settee, clasped her hands, and looked straight
      before her, not at her mother. She had the expression of one who had been
      startled by a sound and was listening to know what would come of it. The
      sudden change of the situation was bewildering. A few minutes before she
      was looking along an inescapable path of repulsive monotony, with hopeless
      inward rebellion against the imperious lot which left her no choice: and
      lo, now, a moment of choice was come. Yet&mdash;was it triumph she felt
      most or terror? Impossible for Gwendolen not to feel some triumph in a
      tribute to her power at a time when she was first tasting the bitterness
      of insignificance: again she seemed to be getting a sort of empire over
      her own life. But how to use it? Here came the terror. Quick, quick, like
      pictures in a book beaten open with a sense of hurry, came back vividly,
      yet in fragments, all that she had gone through in relation to Grandcourt&mdash;the
      allurements, the vacillations, the resolve to accede, the final repulsion;
      the incisive face of that dark-eyed lady with the lovely boy: her own
      pledge (was it a pledge not to marry him?)&mdash;the new disbelief in the
      worth of men and things for which that scene of disclosure had become a
      symbol. That unalterable experience made a vision at which in the first
      agitated moment, before tempering reflections could suggest themselves,
      her native terror shrank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was the good of choice coming again? What did she wish? Anything
      different? No! And yet in the dark seed-growths of consciousness a new
      wish was forming itself&mdash;&ldquo;I wish I had never known it!&rdquo;
      Something, anything she wished for that would have saved her from the
      dread to let Grandcourt come.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no long while&mdash;yet it seemed long to Mrs. Davilow, before she
      thought it well to say, gently,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be necessary for you to write, dear. Or shall I write an
      answer for you&mdash;which you will dictate?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, drawing a deep breath. &ldquo;But
      please lay me out the pen and paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was gaining time. Was she to decline Grandcourt&rsquo;s visit&mdash;close
      the shutters&mdash;not even look out on what would happen?&mdash;though
      with the assurance that she should remain just where she was? The young
      activity within her made a warm current through her terror and stirred
      toward something that would be an event&mdash;toward an opportunity in
      which she could look and speak with the former effectiveness. The interest
      of the morrow was no longer at a deadlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is really no reason on earth why you should be so alarmed at
      the man&rsquo;s waiting a few minutes, mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      remonstrantly, as Mrs. Davilow, having prepared the writing materials,
      looked toward her expectantly. &ldquo;Servants expect nothing else than to
      wait. It is not to be supposed that I must write on the instant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, in the tone of one corrected,
      turning to sit down and take up a bit of work that lay at hand; &ldquo;he
      can wait another quarter of an hour, if you like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very simple speech and action on her part, but it was what might
      have been subtly calculated. Gwendolen felt a contradictory desire to be
      hastened: hurry would save her from deliberate choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean him to wait long enough for that needlework to be
      finished,&rdquo; she said, lifting her hands to stroke the backward curves
      of her hair, while she rose from her seat and stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t feel able to decide?&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow, sympathizingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>must</i> decide,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, walking to the
      writing-table and seating herself. All the while there was a busy
      undercurrent in her, like the thought of a man who keeps up a dialogue
      while he is considering how he can slip away. Why should she not let him
      come? It bound her to nothing. He had been to Leubronn after her: of
      course he meant a direct unmistakable renewal of the suit which before had
      been only implied. What then? She could reject him. Why was she to deny
      herself the freedom of doing this&mdash;which she would like to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mr. Grandcourt has only just returned from Leubronn,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Davilow, observing that Gwendolen leaned back in her chair after
      taking the pen in her hand&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder whether he has heard of
      our misfortunes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That could make no difference to a man in his position,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, rather contemptuously,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would to some men,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow. &ldquo;They would
      not like to take a wife from a family in a state of beggary almost, as we
      are. Here we are at Offendene with a great shell over us, as usual. But
      just imagine his finding us at Sawyer&rsquo;s Cottage. Most men are afraid
      of being bored or taxed by a wife&rsquo;s family. If Mr. Grandcourt did
      know, I think it a strong proof of his attachment to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow spoke with unusual emphasis: it was the first time she had
      ventured to say anything about Grandcourt which would necessarily seem
      intended as an argument in favor of him, her habitual impression being
      that such arguments would certainly be useless and might be worse. The
      effect of her words now was stronger than she could imagine: they raised a
      new set of possibilities in Gwendolen&rsquo;s mind&mdash;a vision of what
      Grandcourt might do for her mother if she, Gwendolen, did&mdash;what she
      was not going to do. She was so moved by a new rush of ideas that, like
      one conscious of being urgently called away, she felt that the immediate
      task must be hastened: the letter must be written, else it might be
      endlessly deferred. After all, she acted in a hurry, as she had wished to
      do. To act in a hurry was to have a reason for keeping away from an
      absolute decision, and to leave open as many issues as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote: &ldquo;Miss Harleth presents her compliments to Mr. Grandcourt.
      She will be at home after two o&rsquo;clock to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before addressing the note she said, &ldquo;Pray ring the bell, mamma, if
      there is any one to answer it.&rdquo; She really did not know who did the
      work of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till after the letter had been taken away and Gwendolen had
      risen again, stretching out one arm and then resting it on her head, with
      a low moan which had a sound of relief in it, that Mrs. Davilow ventured
      to ask,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say, Gwen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that I should be at home,&rdquo; answered Gwendolen, rather
      loftily. Then after a pause, &ldquo;You must not expect, because Mr.
      Grandcourt is coming, that anything is going to happen, mamma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t allow myself to expect anything, dear. I desire you
      to follow your own feeling. You have never told me what that was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of telling?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, hearing a
      reproach in that true statement. &ldquo;When I have anything pleasant to
      tell, you may be sure I will tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Grandcourt will consider that you have already accepted
      him, in allowing him to come. His note tells you plainly enough that he is
      coming to make you an offer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; and I wish to have the pleasure of refusing him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow looked up in wonderment, but Gwendolen implied her wish not
      to be questioned further by saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put down that detestable needle-work, and let us walk in the
      avenue. I am stifled.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Desire has trimmed the sails, and Circumstance
  Brings but the breeze to fill them.
</pre>
    <p>
      While Grandcourt on his beautiful black Yarico, the groom behind him on
      Criterion, was taking the pleasant ride from Diplow to Offendene,
      Gwendolen was seated before the mirror while her mother gathered up the
      lengthy mass of light-brown hair which she had been carefully brushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only gather it up easily and make a coil, mamma,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me bring you some ear-rings, Gwen,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow,
      when the hair was adjusted, and they were both looking at the reflection
      in the glass. It was impossible for them not to notice that the eyes
      looked brighter than they had done of late, that there seemed to be a
      shadow lifted from the face, leaving all the lines once more in their
      placid youthfulness. The mother drew some inference that made her voice
      rather cheerful. &ldquo;You do want your earrings?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mamma; I shall not wear any ornaments, and I shall put on my
      black silk. Black is the only wear when one is going to refuse an offer,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, with one of her old smiles at her mother, while she rose
      to throw off her dressing-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose the offer is not made after all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow,
      not without a sly intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that will be because I refuse it beforehand,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen. &ldquo;It comes to the same thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a proud little toss of the head as she said this; and when she
      walked down-stairs in her long black robes, there was just that firm poise
      of head and elasticity of form which had lately been missing, as in a
      parched plant. Her mother thought, &ldquo;She is quite herself again. It
      must be pleasure in his coming. Can her mind be really made up against
      him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen would have been rather angry if that thought had been uttered;
      perhaps all the more because through the last twenty hours, with a brief
      interruption of sleep, she had been so occupied with perpetually
      alternating images and arguments for and against the possibility of her
      marrying Grandcourt, that the conclusion which she had determined on
      beforehand ceased to have any hold on her consciousness: the alternate dip
      of counterbalancing thoughts begotten of counterbalancing desires had
      brought her into a state in which no conclusion could look fixed to her.
      She would have expressed her resolve as before; but it was a form out of
      which the blood had been sucked&mdash;no more a part of quivering life
      than the &ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done&rdquo; of one who is eagerly
      watching chances. She did not mean to accept Grandcourt; from the first
      moment of receiving his letter she had meant to refuse him; still, that
      could not but prompt her to look the unwelcome reasons full in the face
      until she had a little less awe of them, could not hinder her imagination
      from filling out her knowledge in various ways, some of which seemed to
      change the aspect of what she knew. By dint of looking at a dubious object
      with a constructive imagination, one can give it twenty different shapes.
      Her indistinct grounds of hesitation before the interview at the
      Whispering Stones, at present counted for nothing; they were all merged in
      the final repulsion. If it had not been for that day in Cardell Chase, she
      said to herself now, there would have been no obstacle to her marrying
      Grandcourt. On that day and after it, she had not reasoned and balanced;
      she had acted with a force of impulse against which all questioning was no
      more than a voice against a torrent. The impulse had come&mdash;not only
      from her maidenly pride and jealousy, not only from the shock of another
      woman&rsquo;s calamity thrust close on her vision, but&mdash;from her
      dread of wrong-doing, which was vague, it was true, and aloof from the
      daily details of her life, but not the less strong. Whatever was accepted
      as consistent with being a lady she had no scruple about; but from the dim
      region of what was called disgraceful, wrong, guilty, she shrunk with
      mingled pride and terror; and even apart from shame, her feeling would
      have made her place any deliberate injury of another in the region of
      guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now&mdash;did she know exactly what was the state of the case with
      regard to Mrs. Glasher and her children? She had given a sort of promise&mdash;had
      said, &ldquo;I will not interfere with your wishes.&rdquo; But would
      another woman who married Grandcourt be in fact the decisive obstacle to
      her wishes, or be doing her and her boy any real injury? Might it not be
      just as well, nay better, that Grandcourt should marry? For what could not
      a woman do when she was married, if she knew how to assert herself? Here
      all was constructive imagination. Gwendolen had about as accurate a
      conception of marriage&mdash;that is to say, of the mutual influences,
      demands, duties of man and woman in the state of matrimony&mdash;as she
      had of magnetic currents and the law of storms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma managed badly,&rdquo; was her way of summing up what she had
      seen of her mother&rsquo;s experience: she herself would manage quite
      differently. And the trials of matrimony were the last theme into which
      Mrs. Davilow could choose to enter fully with this daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what mamma and my uncle would say if they knew about Mrs.
      Glasher!&rdquo; thought Gwendolen in her inward debating; not that she
      could imagine herself telling them, even if she had not felt bound to
      silence. &ldquo;I wonder what anybody would say; or what they would say to
      Mr. Grandcourt&rsquo;s marrying some one else and having other children!&rdquo;
      To consider what &ldquo;anybody&rdquo; would say, was to be released from
      the difficulty of judging where everything was obscure to her when feeling
      had ceased to be decisive. She had only to collect her memories, which
      proved to her that &ldquo;anybody&rdquo; regarded the illegitimate
      children as more rightfully to be looked shy on and deprived of social
      advantages than illegitimate fathers. The verdict of &ldquo;anybody&rdquo;
      seemed to be that she had no reason to concern herself greatly on behalf
      of Mrs. Glasher and her children.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was another way in which they had caused her concern. What
      others might think could not do away with a feeling which in the first
      instance would hardly be too strongly described as indignation and
      loathing that she should have been expected to unite herself with an
      outworn life, full of backward secrets which must have been more keenly
      felt than any association with <i>her</i>. True, the question of love on
      her own part had occupied her scarcely at all in relation to Grandcourt.
      The desirability of marriage for her had always seemed due to other
      feeling than love; and to be enamored was the part of the man, on whom the
      advances depended. Gwendolen had found no objection to Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      way of being enamored before she had had that glimpse of his past, which
      she resented as if it had been a deliberate offense against her. His
      advances to <i>her</i> were deliberate, and she felt a retrospective
      disgust for them. Perhaps other men&rsquo;s lives were of the same kind&mdash;full
      of secrets which made the ignorant suppositions of the women they wanted
      to marry a farce at which they were laughing in their sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      These feelings of disgust and indignation had sunk deep; and though other
      troublous experience in the last weeks had dulled them from passion into
      remembrance, it was chiefly their reverberating activity which kept her
      firm to the understanding with herself, that she was not going to accept
      Grandcourt. She had never meant to form a new determination; she had only
      been considering what might be thought or said. If anything could have
      induced her to change, it would have been the prospect of making all
      things easy for &ldquo;poor mamma:&rdquo; that, she admitted, was a
      temptation. But no! she was going to refuse him. Meanwhile, the thought
      that he was coming to be refused was inspiriting: she had the white reins
      in her hands again; there was a new current in her frame, reviving her
      from the beaten-down consciousness in which she had been left by the
      interview with Klesmer. She was not now going to crave an opinion of her
      capabilities; she was going to exercise her power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this what made her heart palpitate annoyingly when she heard the horse&rsquo;s
      footsteps on the gravel?&mdash;when Miss Merry, who opened the door to
      Grandcourt, came to tell her that he was in the drawing-room? The hours of
      preparation and the triumph of the situation were apparently of no use:
      she might as well have seen Grandcourt coming suddenly on her in the midst
      of her despondency. While walking into the drawing-room, she had to
      concentrate all her energy in that self-control, which made her appear
      gravely gracious&mdash;as she gave her hand to him, and answered his hope
      that she was quite well in a voice as low and languid as his own. A moment
      afterward, when they were both of them seated on two of the wreath-painted
      chairs&mdash;Gwendolen upright with downcast eyelids, Grandcourt about two
      yards distant, leaning one arm over the back of his chair and looking at
      her, while he held his hat in his left hand&mdash;any one seeing them as a
      picture would have concluded that they were in some stage of love-making
      suspense. And certainly the love-making had begun: she already felt
      herself being wooed by this silent man seated at an agreeable distance,
      with the subtlest atmosphere of attar of roses and an attention bent
      wholly on her. And he also considered himself to be wooing: he was not a
      man to suppose that his presence carried no consequences; and he was
      exactly the man to feel the utmost piquancy in a girl whom he had not
      found quite calculable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was disappointed not to find you at Leubronn,&rdquo; he began,
      his usual broken drawl having just a shade of amorous languor in it.
      &ldquo;The place was intolerable without you. A mere kennel of a place.
      Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t judge what it would be without myself,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, turning her eyes on him, with some recovered sense of mischief.
      &ldquo;<i>With</i> myself I like it well enough to have stayed longer, if
      I could. But I was obliged to come home on account of family troubles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very cruel of you to go to Leubronn,&rdquo; said Grandcourt,
      taking no notice of the troubles, on which Gwendolen&mdash;she hardly knew
      why&mdash;wished that there should be a clear understanding at once.
      &ldquo;You must have known that it would spoil everything: you knew you
      were the heart and soul of everything that went on. Are you quite reckless
      about me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be impossible to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in a tone that would be
      taken seriously; equally impossible to say &ldquo;no;&rdquo; but what else
      could she say? In her difficulty, she turned down her eyelids again and
      blushed over face and neck. Grandcourt saw her in a new phase, and
      believed that she was showing her inclination. But he was determined that
      she should show it more decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps there is some deeper interest? Some attraction&mdash;some
      engagement&mdash;which it would have been only fair to make me aware of?
      Is there any man who stands between us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly the answer framed itself. &ldquo;No; but there is a woman.&rdquo;
      Yet how could she utter this? Even if she had not promised that woman to
      be silent, it would have been impossible for her to enter on the subject
      with Grandcourt. But how could she arrest his wooing by beginning to make
      a formal speech&mdash;&ldquo;I perceive your intention&mdash;it is most
      flattering, etc.&rdquo;? A fish honestly invited to come and be eaten has
      a clear course in declining, but how if it finds itself swimming against a
      net? And apart from the network, would she have dared at once to say
      anything decisive? Gwendolen had not time to be clear on that point. As it
      was, she felt compelled to silence, and after a pause, Grandcourt said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand that some one else is preferred?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen, now impatient of her own embarrassment, determined to rush at
      the difficulty and free herself. She raised her eyes again and said with
      something of her former clearness and defiance, &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;wishing
      him to understand, &ldquo;What then? I may not be ready to take <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
      There was nothing that Grandcourt could not understand which he perceived
      likely to affect his <i>amour propre</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last thing I would do, is to importune you. I should not hope
      to win you by making myself a bore. If there were no hope for me, I would
      ask you to tell me so at once, that I might just ride away to&mdash;no
      matter where.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost to her own astonishment, Gwendolen felt a sudden alarm at the image
      of Grandcourt finally riding away. What would be left her then? Nothing
      but the former dreariness. She liked him to be there. She snatched at the
      subject that would defer any decisive answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear you are not aware of what has happened to us. I have lately
      had to think so much of my mamma&rsquo;s troubles, that other subjects
      have been quite thrown into the background. She has lost all her fortune,
      and we are going to leave this place. I must ask you to excuse my seeming
      preoccupied.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In eluding a direct appeal Gwendolen recovered some of her
      self-possession. She spoke with dignity and looked straight at Grandcourt,
      whose long, narrow, impenetrable eyes met hers, and mysteriously arrested
      them: mysteriously; for the subtly-varied drama between man and woman is
      often such as can hardly be rendered in words put together like dominoes,
      according to obvious fixed marks. The word of all work, Love, will no more
      express the myriad modes of mutual attraction, than the word Thought can
      inform you what is passing through your neighbor&rsquo;s mind. It would be
      hard to tell on which side&mdash;Gwendolen&rsquo;s or Grandcourt&rsquo;s&mdash;the
      influence was more mixed. At that moment his strongest wish was to be
      completely master of this creature&mdash;this piquant combination of
      maidenliness and mischief: that she knew things which had made her start
      away from him, spurred him to triumph over that repugnance; and he was
      believing that he should triumph. And she&mdash;ah, piteous equality in
      the need to dominate!&mdash;she was overcome like the thirsty one who is
      drawn toward the seeming water in the desert, overcome by the suffused
      sense that here in this man&rsquo;s homage to her lay the rescue from
      helpless subjection to an oppressive lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the while they were looking at each other; and Grandcourt said, slowly
      and languidly, as if it were of no importance, other things having been
      settled,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will tell me now, I hope, that Mrs. Davilow&rsquo;s loss of
      fortune will not trouble you further. You will trust me to prevent it from
      weighing upon her. You will give me the claim to provide against that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little pauses and refined drawlings with which this speech was
      uttered, gave time for Gwendolen to go through the dream of a life. As the
      words penetrated her, they had the effect of a draught of wine, which
      suddenly makes all things easier, desirable things not so wrong, and
      people in general less disagreeable. She had a momentary phantasmal love
      for this man who chose his words so well, and who was a mere incarnation
      of delicate homage. Repugnance, dread, scruples&mdash;these were dim as
      remembered pains, while she was already tasting relief under the immediate
      pain of hopelessness. She imagined herself already springing to her
      mother, and being playful again. Yet when Grandcourt had ceased to speak,
      there was an instant in which she was conscious of being at the turning of
      the ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very generous,&rdquo; she said, not moving her eyes, and
      speaking with a gentle intonation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You accept what will make such things a matter of course?&rdquo;
      said Grandcourt, without any new eagerness. &ldquo;You consent to become
      my wife?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Gwendolen remained quite pale. Something made her rise from her
      seat in spite of herself and walk to a little distance. Then she turned
      and with her hands folded before her stood in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt immediately rose too, resting his hat on the chair, but still
      keeping hold of it. The evident hesitation of this destitute girl to take
      his splendid offer stung him into a keenness of interest such as he had
      not known for years. None the less because he attributed her hesitation
      entirely to her knowledge about Mrs. Glasher. In that attitude of
      preparation, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you command me to go?&rdquo; No familiar spirit could have
      suggested to him more effective words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gwendolen. She could not let him go: that negative
      was a clutch. She seemed to herself to be, after all, only drifted toward
      the tremendous decision&mdash;but drifting depends on something besides
      the currents when the sails have been set beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You accept my devotion?&rdquo; said Grandcourt, holding his hat by
      his side and looking straight into her eyes, without other movement. Their
      eyes meeting in that way seemed to allow any length of pause: but wait as
      long as she would, how could she contradict herself? What had she detained
      him for? He had shut out any explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came as gravely from Gwendolen&rsquo;s lips as if she
      had been answering to her name in a court of justice. He received it
      gravely, and they still looked at each other in the same attitude. Was
      there ever such a way before of accepting the bliss-giving &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;?
      Grandcourt liked better to be at that distance from her, and to feel under
      a ceremony imposed by an indefinable prohibition that breathed from
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did at length lay down his hat and advance to take her hand, just
      pressing his lips upon it and letting it go again. She thought his
      behavior perfect, and gained a sense of freedom which made her almost
      ready to be mischievous. Her &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; entailed so little at this
      moment that there was nothing to screen the reversal of her gloomy
      prospects; her vision was filled by her own release from the Momperts, and
      her mother&rsquo;s release from Sawyer&rsquo;s Cottage. With a happy curl
      of the lips, she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not see mamma? I will fetch her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us wait a little,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, in his favorite
      attitude, having his left forefinger and thumb in his waist-coat pocket,
      and with his right hand caressing his whisker, while he stood near
      Gwendolen and looked at her&mdash;not unlike a gentleman who has a
      felicitous introduction at an evening party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything else to say to me?&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I know having things said to you is a great bore,&rdquo;
      said Grandcourt, rather sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when they are things I like to hear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it bother you to be asked how soon we can be married?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it will, to-day,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, putting up her chin
      saucily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-day, then, but to-morrow. Think of it before I come
      to-morrow. In a fortnight&mdash;or three weeks&mdash;as soon as possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you think you will be tired of my company,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen. &ldquo;I notice when people are married the husband is not so
      much with his wife as when they are engaged. But perhaps I shall like that
      better, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed charmingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have whatever you like,&rdquo; said Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nothing that I don&rsquo;t like?&mdash;please say that; because
      I think I dislike what I don&rsquo;t like more than I like what I like,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, finding herself in the woman&rsquo;s paradise, where all
      her nonsense is adorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt paused; these were subtilties in which he had much experience
      of his own. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;this is such a brute of a
      world, things are always turning up that one doesn&rsquo;t like. I can&rsquo;t
      always hinder your being bored. If you like to ride Criterion, I can&rsquo;t
      hinder his coming down by some chance or other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my friend Criterion, how is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is outside: I made the groom ride him, that you might see him.
      He had the side-saddle on for an hour or two yesterday. Come to the window
      and look at him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They could see the two horses being taken slowly round the sweep, and the
      beautiful creatures, in their fine grooming, sent a thrill of exultation
      through Gwendolen. They were the symbols of command and luxury, in
      delightful contrast with the ugliness of poverty and humiliation at which
      she had lately been looking close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ride Criterion to-morrow?&rdquo; said Grandcourt. &ldquo;If
      you will, everything shall be arranged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like it of all things,&rdquo; said Gwendolen. &ldquo;I
      want to lose myself in a gallop again. But now I must go and fetch mamma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my arm to the door, then,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, and she
      accepted. Their faces were very near each other, being almost on a level,
      and he was looking at her. She thought his manners as a lover more
      agreeable than any she had seen described. She had no alarm lest he meant
      to kiss her, and was so much at her ease, that she suddenly paused in the
      middle of the room and said half archly, half earnestly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, while I think of it&mdash;there is something I dislike that you
      can save me from. I do <i>not</i> like Mr. Lush&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not have it. I&rsquo;ll get rid of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not fond of him yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. I let him hang on me because he has always been a
      poor devil,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, in an <i>adagio</i> of utter
      indifference. &ldquo;They got him to travel with me when I was a lad. He
      was always that coarse-haired kind of brute&mdash;sort of cross between a
      hog and a <i>dilettante</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen laughed. All that seemed kind and natural enough: Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      fastidiousness enhanced the kindness. And when they reached the door, his
      way of opening it for her was the perfection of easy homage. Really, she
      thought, he was likely to be the least disagreeable of husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow was waiting anxiously in her bed-room when Gwendolen entered,
      stepped toward her quickly, and kissing her on both cheeks said in a low
      tone, &ldquo;Come down, mamma, and see Mr. Grandcourt. I am engaged to
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, with a surprise that
      was rather solemn than glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, in the same tone, and with a quickness
      which implied that it was needless to ask questions. &ldquo;Everything is
      settled. You are not going to Sawyer&rsquo;s Cottage, I am not going to be
      inspected by Mrs. Mompert, and everything is to be as I like. So come down
      with me immediately.&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Il est plus aisé de connoître l&rsquo;homme en général que de connoître un
     homme en particulier.&rdquo;&mdash;LA ROCHEFOUCAULD.
</pre>
    <p>
      An hour after Grandcourt had left, the important news of Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      engagement was known at the rectory, and Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne, with
      Anna, spent the evening at Offendene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, let me congratulate you on having created a strong
      attachment,&rdquo; said the rector. &ldquo;You look serious, and I don&rsquo;t
      wonder at it: a lifelong union is a solemn thing. But from the way Mr.
      Grandcourt has acted and spoken I think we may already see some good
      arising out of our adversity. It has given you an opportunity of observing
      your future husband&rsquo;s delicate liberality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gascoigne referred to Grandcourt&rsquo;s mode of implying that he
      would provide for Mrs. Davilow&mdash;a part of the love-making which
      Gwendolen had remembered to cite to her mother with perfect accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have no doubt that Mr. Grandcourt would have behaved quite as
      handsomely if you had not gone away to Germany, Gwendolen, and had been
      engaged to him, as you no doubt might have been, more than a month ago,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Gascoigne, feeling that she had to discharge a duty on this
      occasion. &ldquo;But now there is no more room for caprice; indeed, I
      trust you have no inclination to any. A woman has a great debt of
      gratitude to a man who perseveres in making her such an offer. But no
      doubt you feel properly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at all sure that I do, aunt,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with
      saucy gravity. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know everything it is proper to feel
      on being engaged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector patted her shoulder and smiled as at a bit of innocent
      naughtiness, and his wife took his behavior as an indication that she was
      not to be displeased. As for Anna, she kissed Gwendolen and said, &ldquo;I
      do hope you will be happy,&rdquo; but then sank into the background and
      tried to keep the tears back too. In the late days she had been imagining
      a little romance about Rex&mdash;how if he still longed for Gwendolen her
      heart might be softened by trouble into love, so that they could by-and-by
      be married. And the romance had turned to a prayer that she, Anna, might
      be able to rejoice like a good sister, and only think of being useful in
      working for Gwendolen, as long as Rex was not rich. But now she wanted
      grace to rejoice in something else. Miss Merry and the four girls, Alice
      with the high shoulders, Bertha and Fanny the whisperers, and Isabel the
      listener, were all present on this family occasion, when everything seemed
      appropriately turning to the honor and glory of Gwendolen, and real life
      was as interesting as &ldquo;Sir Charles Grandison.&rdquo; The evening
      passed chiefly in decisive remarks from the rector, in answer to
      conjectures from the two elder ladies. According to him, the case was not
      one in which he could think it his duty to mention settlements: everything
      must, and doubtless would safely be left to Mr. Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know exactly what sort of places Ryelands and
      Gadsmere are,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gadsmere, I believe, is a secondary place,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Gascoigne; &ldquo;But Ryelands I know to be one of our finest seats. The
      park is extensive and the woods of a very valuable order. The house was
      built by Inigo Jones, and the ceilings are painted in the Italian style.
      The estate is said to be worth twelve thousand a year, and there are two
      livings, one a rectory, in the gift of the Grandcourts. There may be some
      burdens on the land. Still, Mr. Grandcourt was an only child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be most remarkable,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gascoigne, &ldquo;if
      he were to become Lord Stannery in addition to everything else. Only
      think: there is the Grandcourt estate, the Mallinger estate, <i>and</i>
      the baronetcy, <i>and</i> the peerage,&rdquo;&mdash;she was marking off
      the items on her fingers, and paused on the fourth while she added,
      &ldquo;but they say there will be no land coming to him with the peerage.&rdquo;
      It seemed a pity there was nothing for the fifth finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The peerage,&rdquo; said the rector, judiciously, &ldquo;must be
      regarded as a remote chance. There are two cousins between the present
      peer and Mr. Grandcourt. It is certainly a serious reflection how death
      and other causes do sometimes concentrate inheritances on one man. But an
      excess of that kind is to be deprecated. To be Sir Mallinger Grandcourt
      Mallinger&mdash;I suppose that will be his style&mdash;with corresponding
      properties, is a valuable talent enough for any man to have committed to
      him. Let us hope it will be well used.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what a position for the wife, Gwendolen!&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Gascoigne; &ldquo;a great responsibility indeed. But you must lose no time
      in writing to Mrs. Mompert, Henry. It is a good thing that you have an
      engagement of marriage to offer as an excuse, else she might feel
      offended. She is rather a high woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am rid of that horror,&rdquo; thought Gwendolen, to whom the name
      of Mompert had become a sort of Mumbo-jumbo. She was very silent through
      the evening, and that night could hardly sleep at all in her little white
      bed. It was a rarity in her strong youth to be wakeful: and perhaps a
      still greater rarity for her to be careful that her mother should not know
      of her restlessness. But her state of mind was altogether new: she who had
      been used to feel sure of herself, and ready to manage others, had just
      taken a decisive step which she had beforehand thought that she would not
      take&mdash;nay, perhaps, was bound not to take. She could not go backward
      now; she liked a great deal of what lay before her; and there was nothing
      for her to like if she went back. But her resolution was dogged by the
      shadow of that previous resolve which had at first come as the undoubting
      movement of her whole being. While she lay on her pillow with wide-open
      eyes, &ldquo;looking on darkness which the blind do see,&rdquo; she was
      appalled by the idea that she was going to do what she had once started
      away from with repugnance. It was new to her that a question of right or
      wrong in her conduct should rouse her terror; she had known no compunction
      that atoning caresses and presents could not lay to rest. But here had
      come a moment when something like a new consciousness was awaked. She
      seemed on the edge of adopting deliberately, as a notion for all the rest
      of her life, what she had rashly said in her bitterness, when her
      discovery had driven her away to Leubronn:&mdash;that it did not signify
      what she did; she had only to amuse herself as best she could. That
      lawlessness, that casting away of all care for justification, suddenly
      frightened her: it came to her with the shadowy array of possible calamity
      behind it&mdash;calamity which had ceased to be a mere name for her; and
      all the infiltrated influences of disregarded religious teaching, as well
      as the deeper impressions of something awful and inexorable enveloping
      her, seemed to concentrate themselves in the vague conception of avenging
      power. The brilliant position she had longed for, the imagined freedom she
      would create for herself in marriage, the deliverance from the dull
      insignificance of her girlhood&mdash;all immediately before her; and yet
      they had come to her hunger like food with the taint of sacrilege upon it,
      which she must snatch with terror. In the darkness and loneliness of her
      little bed, her more resistant self could not act against the first
      onslaught of dread after her irrevocable decision. That unhappy-faced
      woman and her children&mdash;Grandcourt and his relations with her&mdash;kept
      repeating themselves in her imagination like the clinging memory of a
      disgrace, and gradually obliterated all other thought, leaving only the
      consciousness that she had taken those scenes into her life. Her long
      wakefulness seemed a delirium; a faint, faint light penetrated beside the
      window-curtain; the chillness increased. She could bear it no longer, and
      cried &ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, immediately, in a wakeful
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me come to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She soon went to sleep on her mother&rsquo;s shoulder, and slept on till
      late, when, dreaming of a lit-up ball-room, she opened her eyes on her
      mother standing by the bedside with a small packet in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to wake you, darling, but I thought it better to give
      you this at once. The groom has brought Criterion; he has come on another
      horse, and says he is to stay here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen sat up in bed and opened the packet. It was a delicate enameled
      casket, and inside was a splendid diamond ring with a letter which
      contained a folded bit of colored paper and these words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Pray wear this ring when I come at twelve in sign of our betrothal. I
    enclose a check drawn in the name of Mr. Gascoigne, for immediate
    expenses. Of course Mrs. Davilow will remain at Offendene, at least
    for some time. I hope, when I come, you will have granted me an early
    day, when you may begin to command me at a shorter distance.

    Yours devotedly,

    H. M. GRANDCOURT.
</pre>
    <p>
      The check was for five hundred pounds, and Gwendolen turned it toward her
      mother, with the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very kind and delicate!&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, with much
      feeling. &ldquo;But I really should like better not to be dependent on a
      son-in-law. I and the girls could get along very well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, if you say that again, I will not marry him,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, I trust you are not going to marry only for my sake,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Davilow, deprecatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen tossed her head on the pillow away from her mother, and let the
      ring lie. She was irritated at this attempt to take away a motive. Perhaps
      the deeper cause of her irritation was the consciousness that she was not
      going to marry solely for her mamma&rsquo;s sake&mdash;that she was drawn
      toward the marriage in ways against which stronger reasons than her mother&rsquo;s
      renunciation were yet not strong enough to hinder her. She had waked up to
      the signs that she was irrevocably engaged, and all the ugly visions, the
      alarms, the arguments of the night, must be met by daylight, in which
      probably they would show themselves weak. &ldquo;What I long for is your
      happiness, dear,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Davilow, pleadingly. &ldquo;I will
      not say anything to vex you. Will you not put on the ring?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments Gwendolen did not answer, but her thoughts were active.
      At last she raised herself with a determination to do as she would do if
      she had started on horseback, and go on with spirit, whatever ideas might
      be running in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the lover always put on the betrothal ring himself,&rdquo;
      she said laughingly, slipping the ring on her finger, and looking at it
      with a charming movement of her head. &ldquo;I know why he has sent it,&rdquo;
      she added, nodding at her mamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would rather make me put it on than ask me to let him do it.
      Aha! he is very proud. But so am I. We shall match each other. I should
      hate a man who went down on his knees, and came fawning on me. He really
      is not disgusting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very moderate praise, Gwen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not, for a man,&rdquo; said Gwendolen gaily. &ldquo;But
      now I must get up and dress. Will you come and do my hair, mamma, dear,&rdquo;
      she went on, drawing down her mamma&rsquo;s face to caress it with her own
      cheeks, &ldquo;and not be so naughty any more as to talk of living in
      poverty? You must bear to be made comfortable, even if you don&rsquo;t
      like it. And Mr. Grandcourt behaves perfectly, now, does he not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly he does,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, encouraged, and
      persuaded that after all Gwendolen was fond of her betrothed. She herself
      thought him a man whose attentions were likely to tell on a girl&rsquo;s
      feeling. Suitors must often be judged as words are, by the standing and
      the figure they make in polite society: it is difficult to know much else
      of them. And all the mother&rsquo;s anxiety turned not on Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      character, but on Gwendolen&rsquo;s mood in accepting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mood was necessarily passing through a new phase this morning. Even in
      the hour of making her toilet, she had drawn on all the knowledge she had
      for grounds to justify her marriage. And what she most dwelt on was the
      determination, that when she was Grandcourt&rsquo;s wife, she would urge
      him to the most liberal conduct toward Mrs. Glasher&rsquo;s children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what use would it be to her that I should not marry him? He
      could have married her if he liked; but he did <i>not</i> like. Perhaps
      she is to blame for that. There must be a great deal about her that I know
      nothing of. And he must have been good to her in many ways, else she would
      not have wanted to marry him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But that last argument at once began to appear doubtful. Mrs. Glasher
      naturally wished to exclude other children who would stand between
      Grandcourt and her own: and Gwendolen&rsquo;s comprehension of this
      feeling prompted another way of reconciling claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we shall have no children. I hope we shall not. And he
      might leave the estate to the pretty little boy. My uncle said that Mr.
      Grandcourt could do as he liked with the estates. Only when Sir Hugo
      Mallinger dies there will be enough for two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This made Mrs. Glasher appear quite unreasonable in demanding that her boy
      should be sole heir; and the double property was a security that
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s marriage would do her no wrong, when the wife was
      Gwendolen Harleth with all her proud resolution not to be fairly accused.
      This maiden had been accustomed to think herself blameless; other persons
      only were faulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was striking, that in the hold which this argument of her doing no
      wrong to Mrs. Glasher had taken on her mind, her repugnance to the idea of
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s past had sunk into a subordinate feeling. The terror
      she had felt in the night-watches at overstepping the border of wickedness
      by doing what she had at first felt to be wrong, had dulled any emotions
      about his conduct. She was thinking of him, whatever he might be, as a man
      over whom she was going to have indefinite power; and her loving him
      having never been a question with her, any agreeableness he had was so
      much gain. Poor Gwendolen had no awe of unmanageable forces in the state
      of matrimony, but regarded it as altogether a matter of management, in
      which she would know how to act. In relation to Grandcourt&rsquo;s past
      she encouraged new doubts whether he were likely to have differed much
      from other men; and she devised little schemes for learning what was
      expected of men in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whatever else might be true in the world, her hair was dressed
      suitably for riding, and she went down in her riding-habit, to avoid delay
      before getting on horseback. She wanted to have her blood stirred once
      more with the intoxication of youth, and to recover the daring with which
      she had been used to think of her course in life. Already a load was
      lifted off her; for in daylight and activity it was less oppressive to
      have doubts about her choice, than to feel that she had no choice but to
      endure insignificance and servitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back and make yourself look like a duchess, mamma,&rdquo; she
      said, turning suddenly as she was going down-stairs. &ldquo;Put your
      point-lace over your head. I must have you look like a duchess. You must
      not take things humbly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Grandcourt raised her left hand gently and looked at the ring, she
      said gravely, &ldquo;It was very good of you to think of everything and
      send me that packet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will tell me if there is anything I forget?&rdquo; he said,
      keeping the hand softly within his own. &ldquo;I will do anything you
      wish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am very unreasonable in my wishes,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I expect that. Women always are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will not be unreasonable,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, taking away
      her hand and tossing her head saucily. &ldquo;I will not be told that I am
      what women always are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say that,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, looking at her with his
      usual gravity. &ldquo;You are what no other woman is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that, pray?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, moving to a distance
      with a little air of menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt made his pause before he answered. &ldquo;You are the woman I
      love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what nice speeches!&rdquo; said Gwendolen, laughing. The sense
      of that love which he must once have given to another woman under strange
      circumstances was getting familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a nice speech in return. Say when we are to be married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. Not till we have had a gallop over the downs. I am so
      thirsty for that, I can think of nothing else. I wish the hunting had
      begun. Sunday the twentieth, twenty-seventh, Monday, Tuesday.&rdquo;
      Gwendolen was counting on her fingers with the prettiest nod while she
      looked at Grandcourt, and at last swept one palm over the other while she
      said triumphantly, &ldquo;It will begin in ten days!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us be married in ten days, then,&rdquo; said Grandcourt,
      &ldquo;and we shall not be bored about the stables.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do women always say in answer to that?&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They agree to it,&rdquo; said the lover, rather off his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will not!&rdquo; said Gwendolen, taking up her gauntlets and
      putting them on, while she kept her eyes on him with gathering fun in
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was pleasant on both sides. A cruder lover would have lost the
      view of her pretty ways and attitudes, and spoiled all by stupid attempts
      at caresses, utterly destructive of drama. Grandcourt preferred the drama;
      and Gwendolen, left at ease, found her spirits rising continually as she
      played at reigning. Perhaps if Klesmer had seen more of her in this
      unconscious kind of acting, instead of when she was trying to be
      theatrical, he might have rated her chance higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had had a glorious gallop, however, she was in a state of
      exhilaration that disposed her to think well of hastening the marriage
      which would make her life all of apiece with this splendid kind of
      enjoyment. She would not debate any more about an act to which she had
      committed herself; and she consented to fix the wedding on that day three
      weeks, notwithstanding the difficulty of fulfilling the customary laws of
      the <i>trousseau</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lush, of course, was made aware of the engagement by abundant signs,
      without being formally told. But he expected some communication as a
      consequence of it, and after a few days he became rather impatient under
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s silence, feeling sure that the change would affect his
      personal prospects, and wishing to know exactly how. His tactics no longer
      included any opposition&mdash;which he did not love for its own sake. He
      might easily cause Grandcourt a great deal of annoyance, but it would be
      to his own injury, and to create annoyance was not a motive with him. Miss
      Gwendolen he would certainly not have been sorry to frustrate a little,
      but&mdash;after all there was no knowing what would come. It was nothing
      new that Grandcourt should show a perverse wilfulness; yet in his freak
      about this girl he struck Lush rather newly as something like a man who
      was <i>fey</i>&mdash;led on by an ominous fatality; and that one born to
      his fortune should make a worse business of his life than was necessary,
      seemed really pitiable. Having protested against the marriage, Lush had a
      second-sight for its evil consequences. Grandcourt had been taking the
      pains to write letters and give orders himself instead of employing Lush,
      and appeared to be ignoring his usefulness, even choosing, against the
      habit of years, to breakfast alone in his dressing-room. But a <i>tete-à-tete</i>
      was not to be avoided in a house empty of guests; and Lush hastened to use
      an opportunity of saying&mdash;it was one day after dinner, for there were
      difficulties in Grandcourt&rsquo;s dining at Offendene,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when is the marriage to take place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt, who drank little wine, had left the table and was lounging,
      while he smoked, in an easy chair near the hearth, where a fire of oak
      boughs was gaping to its glowing depths, and edging them with a delicate
      tint of ashes delightful to behold. The chair of red-brown velvet brocade
      was a becoming back-ground for his pale-tinted, well-cut features and
      exquisite long hands. Omitting the cigar, you might have imagined him a
      portrait by Moroni, who would have rendered wonderfully the impenetrable
      gaze and air of distinction; and a portrait by that great master would
      have been quite as lively a companion as Grandcourt was disposed to be.
      But he answered without unusual delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the tenth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you intend to remain here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall go to Ryelands for a little while; but we shall return
      here for the sake of the hunting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After this word there was the languid inarticulate sound frequent with
      Grandcourt when he meant to continue speaking, and Lush waited for
      something more. Nothing came, and he was going to put another question,
      when the inarticulate sound began again and introduced the mildly uttered
      suggestion,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better make some new arrangement for yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! I am to cut and run?&rdquo; said Lush, prepared to be
      good-tempered on the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of that kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bride objects to me. I hope she will make up to you for the
      want of my services.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help your being so damnably disagreeable to women,&rdquo;
      said Grandcourt, in soothing apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To one woman, if you please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes no difference since she is the one in question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I am not to be turned adrift after fifteen years without
      some provision.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have saved something out of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deuced little. I have often saved something for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have three hundred a year. But you must live in town and be
      ready to look after things when I want you. I shall be rather hard up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are not going to be at Ryelands this winter, I might run
      down there and let you know how Swinton goes on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like. I don&rsquo;t care a toss where you are, so that you
      keep out of sight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged,&rdquo; said Lush, able to take the affair more easily
      than he had expected. He was supported by the secret belief that he should
      by-and-by be wanted as much as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will not object to packing up as soon as possible,&rdquo;
      said Grandcourt. &ldquo;The Torringtons are coming, and Miss Harleth will
      be riding over here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart. Can&rsquo;t I be of use in going to Gadsmere?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I am going myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About your being rather hard up. Have you thought of that plan&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just leave me alone, will you?&rdquo; said Grandcourt, in his
      lowest audible tone, tossing his cigar into the fire, and rising to walk
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent the evening in the solitude of the smaller drawing-room, where,
      with various new publications on the table of the kind a gentleman may
      like to have on hand without touching, he employed himself (as a
      philosopher might have done) in sitting meditatively on the sofa and
      abstaining from literature&mdash;political, comic, cynical, or romantic.
      In this way hours may pass surprisingly soon, without the arduous
      invisible chase of philosophy; not from love of thought, but from hatred
      of effort&mdash;from a state of the inward world, something like premature
      age, where the need for action lapses into a mere image of what has been,
      is, and may or might be; where impulse is born and dies in a phantasmal
      world, pausing in rejection of even a shadowy fulfillment. That is a
      condition which often comes with whitening hair; and sometimes, too, an
      intense obstinacy and tenacity of rule, like the main trunk of an
      exorbitant egoism, conspicuous in proportion as the varied
      susceptibilities of younger years are stripped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Grandcourt&rsquo;s hair, though he had not much of it, was of a fine,
      sunny blonde, and his moods were not entirely to be explained as ebbing
      energy. We mortals have a strange spiritual chemistry going on within us,
      so that a lazy stagnation or even a cottony milkiness may be preparing one
      knows not what biting or explosive material. The navvy waking from sleep
      and without malice heaving a stone to crush the life out of his still
      sleeping comrade, is understood to lack the trained motive which makes a
      character fairly calculable in its actions; but by a roundabout course
      even a gentleman may make of himself a chancy personage, raising an
      uncertainty as to what he may do next, that sadly spoils companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s thoughts this evening were like the circlets one sees
      in a dark pool, continually dying out and continually started again by
      some impulse from below the surface. The deeper central impulse came from
      the image of Gwendolen; but the thoughts it stirred would be imperfectly
      illustrated by a reference to the amatory poets of all ages. It was
      characteristic that he got none of his satisfaction from the belief that
      Gwendolen was in love with him; and that love had overcome the jealous
      resentment which had made her run away from him. On the contrary, he
      believed that this girl was rather exceptional in the fact that, in spite
      of his assiduous attention to her, she was not in love with him; and it
      seemed to him very likely that if it had not been for the sudden poverty
      which had come over her family, she would not have accepted him. From the
      very first there had been an exasperating fascination in the tricksiness
      with which she had&mdash;not met his advances, but&mdash;wheeled away from
      them. She had been brought to accept him in spite of everything&mdash;brought
      to kneel down like a horse under training for the arena, though she might
      have an objection to it all the while. On the whole, Grandcourt got more
      pleasure out of this notion than he could have done out of winning a girl
      of whom he was sure that she had a strong inclination for him personally.
      And yet this pleasure in mastering reluctance flourished along with the
      habitual persuasion that no woman whom he favored could be quite
      indifferent to his personal influence; and it seemed to him not unlikely
      that by-and-by Gwendolen might be more enamored of him than he of her. In
      any case, she would have to submit; and he enjoyed thinking of her as his
      future wife, whose pride and spirit were suited to command every one but
      himself. He had no taste for a woman who was all tenderness to him, full
      of petitioning solicitude and willing obedience. He meant to be master of
      a woman who would have liked to master him, and who perhaps would have
      been capable of mastering another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lush, having failed in his attempted reminder to Grandcourt, thought it
      well to communicate with Sir Hugo, in whom, as a man having perhaps
      interest enough to command the bestowal of some place where the work was
      light, gentlemanly, and not ill-paid, he was anxious to cultivate a sense
      of friendly obligation, not feeling at all secure against the future need
      of such a place. He wrote the following letter, and addressed it to Park
      Lane, whither he knew the family had returned from Leubronn:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    MY DEAR SIR HUGO&mdash;Since we came home the marriage has been absolutely
    decided on, and is to take place in less than three weeks. It is so
    far the worse for him that her mother has lately lost all her fortune,
    and he will have to find supplies. Grandcourt, I know, is feeling the
    want of cash; and unless some other plan is resorted to, he will be
    raising money in a foolish way. I am going to leave Diplow
    immediately, and I shall not be able to start the topic. What I should
    advise is, that Mr. Deronda, who I know has your confidence, should
    propose to come and pay a short visit here, according to invitation
    (there are going to be other people in the house), and that you should
    put him fully in possession of your wishes and the possible extent of
    your offer. Then, that he should introduce the subject to Grandcourt
    so as not to imply that you suspect any particular want of money on
    his part, but only that there is a strong wish on yours. What I have
    formerly said to him has been in the way of a conjecture that you
    might be willing to give a good sum for his chance of Diplow; but if
    Mr. Deronda came armed with a definite offer, that would take another
    sort of hold. Ten to one he will not close for some time to come; but
    the proposal will have got a stronger lodgment in his mind; and though
    at present he has a great notion of the hunting here, I see a
    likelihood, under the circumstances, that he will get a distaste for
    the neighborhood, and there will be the notion of the money sticking
    by him without being urged. I would bet on your ultimate success. As I
    am not to be exiled to Siberia, but am to be within call, it is
    possible that, by and by, I may be of more service to you. But at
    present I can think of no medium so good as Mr. Deronda. Nothing puts
    Grandcourt in worse humor than having the lawyers thrust their paper
    under his nose uninvited.

    Trusting that your visit to Leubronn has put you in excellent
    condition  for the winter, I remain, my dear Sir Hugo,

    Yours very faithfully,

    THOMAS CRANMER LUSH.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sir Hugo, having received this letter at breakfast, handed it to Deronda,
      who, though he had chambers in town, was somehow hardly ever in them, Sir
      Hugo not being contented without him. The chatty baronet would have liked
      a young companion even if there had been no peculiar reasons for
      attachment between them: one with a fine harmonious unspoiled face fitted
      to keep up a cheerful view of posterity and inheritance generally,
      notwithstanding particular disappointments; and his affection for Deronda
      was not diminished by the deep-lying though not obtrusive difference in
      their notions and tastes. Perhaps it was all the stronger; acting as the
      same sort of difference does between a man and a woman in giving a
      piquancy to the attachment which subsists in spite of it. Sir Hugo did not
      think unapprovingly of himself; but he looked at men and society from a
      liberal-menagerie point of view, and he had a certain pride in Deronda&rsquo;s
      differing from him, which, if it had found voice, might have said&mdash;&ldquo;You
      see this fine young fellow&mdash;not such as you see every day, is he?&mdash;he
      belongs to me in a sort of way. I brought him up from a child; but you
      would not ticket him off easily, he has notions of his own, and he&rsquo;s
      as far as the poles asunder from what I was at his age.&rdquo; This state
      of feeling was kept up by the mental balance in Deronda, who was moved by
      an affectionateness such as we are apt to call feminine, disposing him to
      yield in ordinary details, while he had a certain inflexibility of
      judgment, and independence of opinion, held to be rightfully masculine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had read the letter, he returned it without speaking, inwardly
      wincing under Lush&rsquo;s mode of attributing a neutral usefulness to him
      in the family affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, Dan? It would be pleasant enough for you. You have
      not seen the place for a good many years now, and you might have a famous
      run with the harriers if you went down next week,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not go on that account,&rdquo; said Deronda, buttering his
      bread attentively. He had an objection to this transparent kind of
      persuasiveness, which all intelligent animals are seen to treat with
      indifference. If he went to Diplow he should be doing something
      disagreeable to oblige Sir Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Lush&rsquo;s notion is a good one. And it would be a pity
      to lose the occasion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a different matter&mdash;if you think my going of
      importance to your object,&rdquo; said Deronda, still with that aloofness
      of manner which implied some suppression. He knew that the baronet had set
      his heart on the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you will see the fair gambler, the Leubronn Diana, I shouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, gaily. &ldquo;We shall have to invite her to
      the Abbey, when they are married,&rdquo; he added, turning to Lady
      Mallinger, as if she too had read the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot conceive whom you mean,&rdquo; said Lady Mallinger, who in
      fact had not been listening, her mind having been taken up with her first
      sips of coffee, the objectionable cuff of her sleeve, and the necessity of
      carrying Theresa to the dentist&mdash;innocent and partly laudable
      preoccupations, as the gentle lady&rsquo;s usually were. Should her
      appearance be inquired after, let it be said that she had reddish blonde
      hair (the hair of the period), a small Roman nose, rather prominent blue
      eyes and delicate eyelids, with a figure which her thinner friends called
      fat, her hands showing curves and dimples like a magnified baby&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that Grandcourt is going to marry the girl you saw at
      Leubronn&mdash;don&rsquo;t you remember her&mdash;the Miss Harleth who
      used to play at roulette.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! Is that a good match for him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on the sort of goodness he wants,&rdquo; said Sir
      Hugo, smiling. &ldquo;However, she and her friends have nothing, and she
      will bring him expenses. It&rsquo;s a good match for my purposes, because
      if I am willing to fork out a sum of money, he may be willing to give up
      his chance of Diplow, so that we shall have it out and out, and when I die
      you will have the consolation of going to the place you would like to go
      to&mdash;wherever I may go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would not talk of dying in that light way, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a heavy way, Lou, for I shall have to pay a heavy
      sum&mdash;forty thousand, at least.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why are we to invite them to the Abbey?&rdquo; said Lady
      Mallinger. &ldquo;I do <i>not</i> like women who gamble, like Lady
      Cragstone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you will not mind her for a week. Besides, she is not like Lady
      Cragstone because she gambled a little, any more than I am like a broker
      because I&rsquo;m a Whig. I want to keep Grandcourt in good humor, and to
      let him see plenty of this place, that he may think the less of Diplow. I
      don&rsquo;t know yet whether I shall get him to meet me in this matter.
      And if Dan were to go over on a visit there, he might hold out the bait to
      him. It would be doing me a great service.&rdquo; This was meant for
      Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daniel is not fond of Mr. Grandcourt, I think, is he?&rdquo; said
      Lady Mallinger, looking at Deronda inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no avoiding everybody one doesn&rsquo;t happen to be fond
      of,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;I will go to Diplow&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      know that I have anything better to do&mdash;since Sir Hugo wishes it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a trump!&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, well pleased. &ldquo;And
      if you don&rsquo;t find it very pleasant, it&rsquo;s so much experience.
      Nothing used to come amiss to me when I was young. You must see men and
      manners.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I have seen that man, and something of his manners too,&rdquo;
      said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not nice manners, I think,&rdquo; said Lady Mallinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see they succeed with your sex,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo,
      provokingly. &ldquo;And he was an uncommonly good-looking fellow when he
      was two or three and twenty&mdash;like his father. He doesn&rsquo;t take
      after his father in marrying the heiress, though. If he had got Miss
      Arrowpoint and my land too, confound him, he would have had a fine
      principality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda, in anticipating the projected visit, felt less disinclination
      than when consenting to it. The story of that girl&rsquo;s marriage did
      interest him: what he had heard through Lush of her having run away from
      the suit of the man she was now going to take as a husband, had thrown a
      new sort of light on her gambling; and it was probably the transition from
      that fevered worldliness into poverty which had urged her acceptance where
      she must in some way have felt repulsion. All this implied a nature liable
      to difficulty and struggle&mdash;elements of life which had a predominant
      attraction for his sympathy, due perhaps to his early pain in dwelling on
      the conjectured story of his own existence. Persons attracted him, as Hans
      Meyrick had done, in proportion to the possibility of his defending them,
      rescuing them, telling upon their lives with some sort of redeeming
      influence; and he had to resist an inclination, easily accounted for, to
      withdraw coldly from the fortunate. But in the movement which had led him
      to repurchase Gwendolen&rsquo;s necklace for her, and which was at work in
      him still, there was something beyond his habitual compassionate fervor&mdash;something
      due to the fascination of her womanhood. He was very open to that sort of
      charm, and mingled it with the consciously Utopian pictures of his own
      future; yet any one able to trace the folds of his character might have
      conceived that he would be more likely than many less passionate men to
      love a woman without telling her of it. Sprinkle food before a
      delicate-eared bird: there is nothing he would more willingly take, yet he
      keeps aloof, because of his sensibility to checks which to you are
      imperceptible. And one man differs from another, as we all differ from the
      Bosjesman, in a sensibility to checks, that come from variety of needs,
      spiritual or other. It seemed to foreshadow that capability of reticence
      in Deronda that his imagination was much occupied with two women, to
      neither of whom would he have held it possible that he should ever make
      love. Hans Meyrick had laughed at him for having something of the
      knight-errant in his disposition; and he would have found his proof if he
      had known what was just now going on in Deronda&rsquo;s mind about Mirah
      and Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda wrote without delay to announce his visit to Diplow, and received
      in reply a polite assurance that his coming would give great pleasure.
      That was not altogether untrue. Grandcourt thought it probable that the
      visit was prompted by Sir Hugo&rsquo;s desire to court him for a purpose
      which he did not make up his mind to resist; and it was not a disagreeable
      idea to him that this fine fellow, whom he believed to be his cousin under
      the rose, would witness, perhaps with some jealousy, Henleigh Mallinger
      Grandcourt play the commanding part of betrothed lover to a splendid girl
      whom the cousin had already looked at with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt himself was not jealous of anything unless it threatened his
      mastery&mdash;which he did not think himself likely to lose.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice,
     him or her I shall follow.
  As the water follows the moon, silently,
     with fluid steps anywhere around the globe.&rdquo;
                                     &mdash;WALT WHITMAN.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now my cousins are at Diplow,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, &ldquo;will
      you go there?&mdash;to-morrow? The carriage shall come for Mrs. Davilow.
      You can tell me what you would like done in the rooms. Things must be put
      in decent order while we are away at Ryelands. And to-morrow is the only
      day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting sideways on a sofa in the drawing-room at Offendene, one
      hand and elbow resting on the back, and the other hand thrust between his
      crossed knees&mdash;in the attitude of a man who is much interested in
      watching the person next to him. Gwendolen, who had always disliked
      needlework, had taken to it with apparent zeal since her engagement, and
      now held a piece of white embroidery which, on examination, would have
      shown many false stitches. During the last eight or nine days their hours
      had been chiefly spent on horseback, but some margin had always been left
      for this more difficult sort of companionship, which, however, Gwendolen
      had not found disagreeable. She was very well satisfied with Grandcourt.
      His answers to her lively questions about what he had seen and done in his
      life, bore drawling very well. From the first she had noticed that he knew
      what to say; and she was constantly feeling not only that he had nothing
      of the fool in his composition, but that by some subtle means he
      communicated to her the impression that all the folly lay with other
      people, who did what he did not care to do. A man who seems to have been
      able to command the best, has a sovereign power of depreciation. Then
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s behavior as a lover had hardly at all passed the limit
      of an amorous homage which was inobtrusive as a wafted odor of roses, and
      spent all its effects in a gratified vanity. One day, indeed, he had
      kissed not her cheek but her neck a little below her ear; and Gwendolen,
      taken by surprise, had started up with a marked agitation which made him
      rise too and say, &ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;did I annoy you?&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Oh, it was nothing,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, rather afraid of
      herself, &ldquo;only I cannot bear&mdash;to be kissed under my ear.&rdquo;
      She sat down again with a little playful laugh, but all the while she felt
      her heart beating with a vague fear: she was no longer at liberty to flout
      him as she had flouted poor Rex. Her agitation seemed not uncomplimentary,
      and he had been contented not to transgress again.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day a slight rain hindered riding; but to compensate, a package had
      come from London, and Mrs. Davilow had just left the room after bringing
      in for admiration the beautiful things (of Grandcourt&rsquo;s ordering)
      which lay scattered about on the tables. Gwendolen was just then enjoying
      the scenery of her life. She let her hands fall on her lap, and said with
      a pretty air of perversity,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is to-morrow the only day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the next day is the first with the hounds,&rdquo; said
      Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that I must go away for a couple of days&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
      bore&mdash;but I shall go one day and come back the next.&rdquo;
      Grandcourt noticed a change in her face, and releasing his hand from under
      his knees, he laid it on hers, and said, &ldquo;You object to my going
      away?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use objecting,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, coldly. She was
      resisting to the utmost her temptation to tell him that she suspected to
      whom he was going&mdash;the temptation to make a clean breast, speaking
      without restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes it is,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, enfolding her hand. &ldquo;I
      will put off going. And I will travel at night, so as only to be away one
      day.&rdquo; He thought that he knew the reason of what he inwardly called
      this bit of temper, and she was particularly fascinating to him at this
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t put off going, but travel at night,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, feeling that she could command him, and finding in this
      peremptoriness a small outlet for her irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will go to Diplow to-morrow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, if you wish it,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, in a high tone of
      careless assent. Her concentration in other feelings had really hindered
      her from taking notice that her hand was being held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you treat us poor devils of men!&rdquo; said Grandcourt,
      lowering his tone. &ldquo;We are always getting the worst of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Are</i> you?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, in a tone of inquiry,
      looking at him more naïvely than usual. She longed to believe this
      commonplace <i>badinage</i> as the serious truth about her lover: in that
      case, she too was justified. If she knew everything, Mrs. Glasher would
      appear more blamable than Grandcourt. &ldquo;<i>Are</i> you always getting
      the worst?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Are you as kind to me as I am to you?&rdquo; said Grandcourt,
      looking into her eyes with his narrow gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen felt herself stricken. She was conscious of having received so
      much, that her sense of command was checked, and sank away in the
      perception that, look around her as she might, she could not turn back: it
      was as if she had consented to mount a chariot where another held the
      reins; and it was not in her nature to leap out in the eyes of the world.
      She had not consented in ignorance, and all she could say now would be a
      confession that she had not been ignorant. Her right to explanation was
      gone. All she had to do now was to adjust herself, so that the spikes of
      that unwilling penance which conscience imposed should not gall her. With
      a sort of mental shiver, she resolutely changed her mental attitude. There
      had been a little pause, during which she had not turned away her eyes;
      and with a sudden break into a smile, she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were as kind to you as you are to me, that would spoil your
      generosity: it would no longer be as great as it could be&mdash;and it is
      that now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am not to ask for one kiss,&rdquo; said Grandcourt,
      contented to pay a large price for this new kind of love-making, which
      introduced marriage by the finest contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, getting saucy, and nodding at him
      defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her little left hand to his lips, and then released it
      respectfully. Clearly it was faint praise to say of him that he was not
      disgusting: he was almost charming; and she felt at this moment that it
      was not likely she could ever have loved another man better than this one.
      His reticence gave her some inexplicable, delightful consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apropos,&rdquo; she said, taking up her work again, &ldquo;is there
      any one besides Captain and Mrs. Torrington at Diplow?&mdash;or do you
      leave them <i>tete-à-tete</i>? I suppose he converses in cigars, and she
      answers with her chignon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a sister with her,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, with his shadow
      of a smile, &ldquo;and there are two men besides&mdash;one of them you
      know, I believe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then, I have a poor opinion of him,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      shaking her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw him at Leubronn&mdash;young Deronda&mdash;a young fellow
      with the Mallingers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen felt as if her heart were making a sudden gambol, and her
      fingers, which tried to keep a firm hold on her work, got cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never spoke to him,&rdquo; she said, dreading any discernible
      change in herself. &ldquo;Is he not disagreeable?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not particularly,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, in his most languid
      way. &ldquo;He thinks a little too much of himself. I thought he had been
      introduced to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Some one told me his name the evening before I came away. That
      was all. What is he?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sort of ward of Sir Hugo Mallinger&rsquo;s. Nothing of any
      consequence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, poor creature! How very unpleasant for him!&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, speaking from the lip, and not meaning any sarcasm. &ldquo;I
      wonder if it has left off raining!&rdquo; she added, rising and going to
      look out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily it did not rain the next day, and Gwendolen rode to Diplow on
      Criterion as she had done on that former day when she returned with her
      mother in the carriage. She always felt the more daring for being in her
      riding-dress; besides having the agreeable belief that she looked as well
      as possible in it&mdash;a sustaining consciousness in any meeting which
      seems formidable. Her anger toward Deronda had changed into a
      superstitious dread&mdash;due, perhaps, to the coercion he had exercised
      over her thought&mdash;lest the first interference of his in her life
      might foreshadow some future influence. It is of such stuff that
      superstitions are commonly made: an intense feeling about ourselves which
      makes the evening star shine at us with a threat, and the blessing of a
      beggar encourage us. And superstitions carry consequences which often
      verify their hope or their foreboding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time before luncheon was taken up for Gwendolen by going over the
      rooms with Mrs. Torrington and Mrs. Davilow; and she thought it likely
      that if she saw Deronda, there would hardly be need for more than a bow
      between them. She meant to notice him as little as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after all she found herself under an inward compulsion too strong for
      her pride. From the first moment of their being in the room together, she
      seemed to herself to be doing nothing but notice him; everything else was
      automatic performance of an habitual part.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he took his place at lunch, Grandcourt had said, &ldquo;Deronda, Miss
      Harleth tells me you were not introduced to her at Leubronn?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Harleth hardly remembers me, I imagine,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      looking at her quite simply, as they bowed. &ldquo;She was intensely
      occupied when I saw her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, did he suppose that she had not suspected him of being the person who
      redeemed her necklace?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary. I remember you very well,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      feeling rather nervous, but governing herself and looking at him in return
      with new examination. &ldquo;You did not approve of my playing at
      roulette.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come to that conclusion?&rdquo; said Deronda, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you cast an evil eye on my play,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a
      turn of her head and a smile. &ldquo;I began to lose as soon as you came
      to look on. I had always been winning till then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roulette in such a kennel as Leubronn is a horrid bore,&rdquo; said
      Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> found it a bore when I began to lose,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen. Her face was turned toward Grandcourt as she smiled and spoke,
      but she gave a sidelong glance at Deronda, and saw his eyes fixed on her
      with a look so gravely penetrating that it had a keener edge for her than
      his ironical smile at her losses&mdash;a keener edge than Klesmer&rsquo;s
      judgment. She wheeled her neck round as if she wanted to listen to what
      was being said by the rest, while she was only thinking of Deronda. His
      face had that disturbing kind of form and expression which threatens to
      affect opinion&mdash;as if one&rsquo;s standard was somehow wrong. (Who
      has not seen men with faces of this corrective power till they frustrated
      it by speech or action?) His voice, heard now for the first time, was to
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s toneless drawl, which had been in her ears every day,
      as the deep notes of a violoncello to the broken discourse of poultry and
      other lazy gentry in the afternoon sunshine. Grandcourt, she inwardly
      conjectured, was perhaps right in saying that Deronda thought too much of
      himself:&mdash;a favorite way of explaining a superiority that humiliates.
      However the talk turned on the rinderpest and Jamaica, and no more was
      said about roulette. Grandcourt held that the Jamaica negro was a beastly
      sort of baptist Caliban; Deronda said he had always felt a little with
      Caliban, who naturally had his own point of view and could sing a good
      song; Mrs. Davilow observed that her father had an estate in Barbadoes,
      but that she herself had never been in the West Indies; Mrs. Torrington
      was sure she should never sleep in her bed if she lived among blacks; her
      husband corrected her by saying that the blacks would be manageable enough
      if it were not for the half-breeds; and Deronda remarked that the whites
      had to thank themselves for the half-breeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this polite pea-shooting was going on, Gwendolen trifled with her
      jelly, and looked at every speaker in turn that she might feel at ease in
      looking at Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what he thinks of me, really? He must have felt interested
      in me, else he would not have sent me my necklace. I wonder what he thinks
      of my marriage? What notions has he to make him so grave about things? Why
      is he come to Diplow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These questions ran in her mind as the voice of an uneasy longing to be
      judged by Deronda with unmixed admiration&mdash;a longing which had had
      its seed in her first resentment at his critical glance. Why did she care
      so much about the opinion of this man who was &ldquo;nothing of any
      consequence&rdquo;? She had no time to find the reason&mdash;she was too
      much engaged in caring. In the drawing-room, when something had called
      Grandcourt away, she went quite unpremeditatedly up to Deronda, who was
      standing at a table apart, turning over some prints, and said to him,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you hunt to-morrow, Mr. Deronda?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t object to hunting, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find excuses for it. It is a sin I am inclined to&mdash;when I
      can&rsquo;t get boating or cricketing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you object to my hunting?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a saucy
      movement of the chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right to object to anything you choose to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought you had a right to object to my gambling,&rdquo;
      persisted Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sorry for it. I am not aware that I told you of my objection,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, with his usual directness of gaze&mdash;a large-eyed
      gravity, innocent of any intention. His eyes had a peculiarity which has
      drawn many men into trouble; they were of a dark yet mild intensity which
      seemed to express a special interest in every one on whom he fixed them,
      and might easily help to bring on him those claims which ardently
      sympathetic people are often creating in the minds of those who need help.
      In mendicant fashion we make the goodness of others a reason for
      exorbitant demands on them. That sort of effect was penetrating Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hindered me from gambling again,&rdquo; she answered. But she
      had no sooner spoken than she blushed over face and neck; and Deronda
      blushed, too, conscious that in the little affair of the necklace he had
      taken a questionable freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to speak further; and she turned away to a window,
      feeling that she had stupidly said what she had not meant to say, and yet
      being rather happy that she had plunged into this mutual understanding.
      Deronda also did not dislike it. Gwendolen seemed more decidedly
      attractive than before; and certainly there had been changes going on
      within her since that time at Leubronn: the struggle of mind attending a
      conscious error had wakened something like a new soul, which had better,
      but also worse, possibilities than her former poise of crude
      self-confidence: among the forces she had come to dread was something
      within her that troubled satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Mrs. Davilow said, &ldquo;Was it really so, or only a joke of
      yours, about Mr. Deronda&rsquo;s spoiling your play, Gwen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her curiosity had been excited, and she could venture to ask a question
      that did not concern Mr. Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it merely happened that he was looking on when I began to lose,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, carelessly. &ldquo;I noticed him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at that: he is a striking young man. He puts
      me in mind of Italian paintings. One would guess, without being told, that
      there was foreign blood in his veins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there?&rdquo; said Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Torrington says so. I asked particularly who he was, and she
      told me that his mother was some foreigner of high rank.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His mother?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, rather sharply. &ldquo;Then who
      was his father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;every one says he is the son of Sir Hugo Mallinger, who
      brought him up; though he passes for a ward. She says, if Sir Hugo
      Mallinger could have done as he liked with his estates, he would have left
      them to this Mr. Deronda, since he has no legitimate son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen was silent; but her mother observed so marked an effect in her
      face that she was angry with herself for having repeated Mrs. Torrington&rsquo;s
      gossip. It seemed, on reflection, unsuited to the ear of her daughter, for
      whom Mrs. Davilow disliked what is called knowledge of the world; and
      indeed she wished that she herself had not had any of it thrust upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      An image which had immediately arisen in Gwendolen&rsquo;s mind was that
      of the unknown mother&mdash;no doubt a dark-eyed woman&mdash;probably sad.
      Hardly any face could be less like Deronda&rsquo;s than that represented
      as Sir Hugo&rsquo;s in a crayon portrait at Diplow. A dark-eyed woman, no
      longer young, had become &ldquo;stuff o&rsquo; the conscience&rdquo; to
      Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night when she had got into her little bed, and only a dim light was
      burning, she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, have men generally children before they are married?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear, no,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow. &ldquo;Why do you ask such
      a question?&rdquo; (But she began to think that she saw the why.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were so, I ought to know,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with some
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are thinking of what I said about Mr. Deronda and Sir Hugo
      Mallinger. That is a very unusual case, dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Lady Mallinger know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows enough to satisfy her. That is quite clear, because Mr.
      Deronda has lived with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And people think no worse of him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course he is under some disadvantage: it is not as if he
      were Lady Mallinger&rsquo;s son. He does not inherit the property, and he
      is not of any consequence in the world. But people are not obliged to know
      anything about his birth; you see, he is very well received.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether he knows about it; and whether he is angry with
      his father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, why should you think of that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, impetuously, sitting up in her bed.
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t children reason to be angry with their parents? How
      can they help their parents marrying or not marrying?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But a consciousness rushed upon her, which made her fall back again on her
      pillow. It was not only what she would have felt months before&mdash;that
      she might seem to be reproaching her mother for that second marriage of
      hers; what she chiefly felt now was that she had been led on to a
      condemnation which seemed to make her own marriage a forbidden thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no further talk, and till sleep came over her Gwendolen lay
      struggling with the reasons against that marriage&mdash;reasons which
      pressed upon her newly now that they were unexpectedly mirrored in the
      story of a man whose slight relations with her had, by some hidden
      affinity, bitten themselves into the most permanent layers of feeling. It
      was characteristic that, with all her debating, she was never troubled by
      the question whether the indefensibleness of her marriage did not include
      the fact that she had accepted Grandcourt solely as a man whom it was
      convenient for her to marry, not in the least as one to whom she would be
      binding herself in duty. Gwendolen&rsquo;s ideas were pitiably crude; but
      many grand difficulties of life are apt to force themselves on us in our
      crudity. And to judge wisely, I suppose we must know how things appear to
      the unwise; that kind of appearance making the larger part of the world&rsquo;s
      history.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning there was a double excitement for her. She was going to
      hunt, from which scruples about propriety had threatened to hinder her,
      until it was found that Mrs. Torrington was horsewoman enough to accompany
      her&mdash;going to hunt for the first time since her escapade with Rex;
      and she was going again to see Deronda, in whom, since last night, her
      interest had so gathered that she expected, as people do about revealed
      celebrities, to see something in his appearance which she had missed
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was he going to be? What sort of life had he before him&mdash;he
      being nothing of any consequence? And with only a little difference in
      events he might have been as important as Grandcourt, nay&mdash;her
      imagination inevitably went into that direction&mdash;might have held the
      very estates which Grandcourt was to have. But now, Deronda would probably
      some day see her mistress of the Abbey at Topping, see her bearing the
      title which would have been his own wife&rsquo;s. These obvious, futile
      thoughts of what might have been, made a new epoch for Gwendolen. She,
      whose unquestionable habit it had been to take the best that came to her
      for less than her own claim, had now to see the position which tempted her
      in a new light, as a hard, unfair exclusion of others. What she had now
      heard about Deronda seemed to her imagination to throw him into one group
      with Mrs. Glasher and her children; before whom she felt herself in an
      attitude of apology&mdash;she who had hitherto been surrounded by a group
      that in her opinion had need be apologetic to her. Perhaps Deronda himself
      was thinking of these things. Could he know of Mrs. Glasher? If he knew
      that she knew, he would despise her; but he could have no such knowledge.
      Would he, without that, despise her for marrying Grandcourt? His possible
      judgment of her actions was telling on her as importunately as Klesmer&rsquo;s
      judgment of her powers; but she found larger room for resistance to a
      disapproval of her marriage, because it is easier to make our conduct seem
      justifiable to ourselves than to make our ability strike others. &ldquo;How
      can I help it?&rdquo; is not our favorite apology for incompetency. But
      Gwendolen felt some strength in saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help what other people have done? Things would not come
      right if I were to turn round now and declare that I would not marry Mr.
      Grandcourt.&rdquo; And such turning round was out of the question. The
      horses in the chariot she had mounted were going at full speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mood of youthful, elated desperation had a tidal recurrence. She
      could dare anything that lay before her sooner than she could choose to go
      backward, into humiliation; and it was even soothing to think that there
      would now be as much ill-doing in the one as in the other. But the
      immediate delightful fact was the hunt, where she would see Deronda, and
      where he would see her; for always lurking ready to obtrude before other
      thoughts about him was the impression that he was very much interested in
      her. But to-day she was resolved not to repeat her folly of yesterday, as
      if she were anxious to say anything to him. Indeed, the hunt would be too
      absorbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was for a long while. Deronda was there, and within her sight
      very often; but this only added to the stimulus of a pleasure which
      Gwendolen had only once before tasted, and which seemed likely always to
      give a delight independent of any crosses, except such as took away the
      chance of riding. No accident happened to throw them together; the run
      took them within convenient reach of home, and the agreeable sombreness of
      the gray November afternoon, with a long stratum of yellow light in the
      west, Gwendolen was returning with the company from Diplow, who were
      attending her on the way to Offendene. Now the sense of glorious
      excitement was over and gone, she was getting irritably disappointed that
      she had had no opportunity of speaking to Deronda, whom she would not see
      again, since he was to go away in a couple of days. What was she going to
      say? That was not quite certain. She wanted to speak to him. Grandcourt
      was by her side; Mrs. Torrington, her husband, and another gentleman in
      advance; and Deronda&rsquo;s horse she could hear behind. The wish to
      speak to him and have him speaking to her was becoming imperious; and
      there was no chance of it unless she simply asserted her will and defied
      everything. Where the order of things could give way to Miss Gwendolen, it
      must be made to do so. They had lately emerged from a wood of pines and
      beeches, where the twilight stillness had a repressing effect, which
      increased her impatience. The horse-hoofs again heard behind at some
      little distance were a growing irritation. She reined in her horse and
      looked behind her; Grandcourt after a few paces, also paused; but she,
      waving her whip and nodding sideways with playful imperiousness, said,
      &ldquo;Go on! I want to speak to Mr. Deronda.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt hesitated; but that he would have done after any proposition.
      It was an awkward situation for him. No gentleman, before marriage, could
      give the emphasis of refusal to a command delivered in this playful way.
      He rode on slowly, and she waited till Deronda came up. He looked at her
      with tacit inquiry, and she said at once, letting her horse go alongside
      of his,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Deronda, you must enlighten my ignorance. I want to know why
      you thought it wrong for me to gamble. Is it because I am a woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not altogether; but I regretted it the more because you were a
      woman,&rdquo; said Deronda, with an irrepressible smile. Apparently it
      must be understood between them now that it was he who sent the necklace.
      &ldquo;I think it would be better for men not to gamble. It is a besotting
      kind of taste, likely to turn into a disease. And, besides, there is
      something revolting to me in raking a heap of money together, and
      internally chuckling over it, when others are feeling the loss of it. I
      should even call it base, if it were more than an exceptional lapse. There
      are enough inevitable turns of fortune which force us to see that our gain
      is another&rsquo;s loss:&mdash;that is one of the ugly aspects of life.
      One would like to reduce it as much as one could, not get amusement out of
      exaggerating it.&rdquo; Deronda&rsquo;s voice had gathered some
      indignation while he was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do admit that we can&rsquo;t help things,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, with a drop in her tone. The answer had not been anything like
      what she had expected. &ldquo;I mean that things are so in spite of us; we
      can&rsquo;t always help it that our gain is another&rsquo;s loss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clearly. Because of that, we should help it where we can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen, biting her lip inside, paused a moment, and then forcing
      herself to speak with an air of playfulness again, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you regret it more because I am a woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps because we need that you should be better than we are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose <i>we</i> need that men should be better than we are,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen with a little air of &ldquo;check!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is rather a difficulty,&rdquo; said Deronda, smiling. &ldquo;I
      suppose I should have said, we each of us think it would be better for the
      other to be good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I needed you to be better than I was&mdash;and you thought
      so,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, nodding and laughing, while she put her horse
      forward and joined Grandcourt, who made no observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to know what I had to say to Mr. Deronda?&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, whose own pride required her to account for her conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;no,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that is the first impolite word you have spoken&mdash;that you
      don&rsquo;t wish to hear what I had to say,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, playing
      at a pout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to hear what you say to me&mdash;not to other men,&rdquo;
      said Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you wish to hear this. I wanted to make him tell me why he
      objected to my gambling, and he gave me a little sermon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but excuse me the sermon.&rdquo; If Gwendolen imagined
      that Grandcourt cared about her speaking to Deronda, he wished her to
      understand that she was mistaken. But he was not fond of being told to
      ride on. She saw he was piqued, but did not mind. She had accomplished her
      object of speaking again to Deronda before he raised his hat and turned
      with the rest toward Diplow, while her lover attended her to Offendene,
      where he was to bid farewell before a whole day&rsquo;s absence on the
      unspecified journey. Grandcourt had spoken truth in calling the journey a
      bore: he was going by train to Gadsmere.

      CHAPTER XXX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  No penitence and no confessional,
  No priest ordains it, yet they&rsquo;re forced to sit
  Amid deep ashes of their vanished years.
</pre>
    <p>
      Imagine a rambling, patchy house, the best part built of gray stone, and
      red-tiled, a round tower jutting at one of the corners, the mellow
      darkness of its conical roof surmounted by a weather-cock making an
      agreeable object either amidst the gleams and greenth of summer or the
      low-hanging clouds and snowy branches of winter: the ground shady with
      spreading trees: a great tree flourishing on one side, backward some
      Scotch firs on a broken bank where the roots hung naked, and beyond, a
      rookery: on the other side a pool overhung with bushes, where the
      water-fowl fluttered and screamed: all around, a vast meadow which might
      be called a park, bordered by an old plantation and guarded by stone
      lodges which looked like little prisons. Outside the gate the country,
      once entirely rural and lovely, now black with coal mines, was chiefly
      peopled by men and brethren with candles stuck in their hats, and with a
      diabolic complexion which laid them peculiarly open to suspicion in the
      eyes of the children at Gadsmere&mdash;Mrs. Glasher&rsquo;s four beautiful
      children, who had dwelt there for about three years. Now, in November,
      when the flower-beds were empty, the trees leafless, and the pool blackly
      shivering, one might have said that the place was sombrely in keeping with
      the black roads and black mounds which seemed to put the district in
      mourning;&mdash;except when the children were playing on the gravel with
      the dogs for their companions. But Mrs. Glasher, under her present
      circumstances, liked Gadsmere as well as she would have liked any other
      abode. The complete seclusion of the place, which the unattractiveness of
      the country secured, was exactly to her taste. When she drove her two
      ponies with a waggonet full of children, there were no gentry in carriages
      to be met, only men of business in gigs; at church there were no eyes she
      cared to avoid, for the curate&rsquo;s wife and the curate himself were
      either ignorant of anything to her disadvantage, or ignored it: to them
      she was simply a widow lady, the tenant of Gadsmere; and the name of
      Grandcourt was of little interest in that district compared with the names
      of Fletcher and Gawcome, the lessees of the collieries.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was full ten years since the elopement of an Irish officer&rsquo;s
      beautiful wife with young Grandcourt, and a consequent duel where the
      bullets wounded the air only, had made some little noise. Most of those
      who remembered the affair now wondered what had become of that Mrs.
      Glasher, whose beauty and brilliancy had made her rather conspicuous to
      them in foreign places, where she was known to be living with young
      Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he should have disentangled himself from that connection seemed only
      natural and desirable. As to her, it was thought that a woman who was
      understood to have forsaken her child along with her husband had probably
      sunk lower. Grandcourt had of course got weary of her. He was much given
      to the pursuit of women: but a man in his position would by this time
      desire to make a suitable marriage with the fair young daughter of a noble
      house. No one talked of Mrs. Glasher now, any more than they talked of the
      victim in a trial for manslaughter ten years before: she was a lost vessel
      after whom nobody would send out an expedition of search; but Grandcourt
      was seen in harbor with his colors flying, registered as seaworthy as
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, in fact, Grandcourt had never disentangled himself from Mrs. Glasher.
      His passion for her had been the strongest and most lasting he had ever
      known; and though it was now as dead as the music of a cracked flute, it
      had left a certain dull disposedness, which, on the death of her husband
      three years before, had prompted in him a vacillating notion of marrying
      her, in accordance with the understanding often expressed between them
      during the days of his first ardor. At that early time Grandcourt would
      willingly have paid for the freedom to be won by a divorce; but the
      husband would not oblige him, not wanting to be married again himself, and
      not wishing to have his domestic habits printed in evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The altered poise which the years had brought in Mrs. Glasher was just the
      reverse. At first she was comparatively careless about the possibility of
      marriage. It was enough that she had escaped from a disagreeable husband
      and found a sort of bliss with a lover who had completely fascinated her&mdash;young,
      handsome, amorous, and living in the best style, with equipage and
      conversation of the kind to be expected in young men of fortune who have
      seen everything. She was an impassioned, vivacious woman, fond of
      adoration, exasperated by five years of marital rudeness; and the sense of
      release was so strong upon her that it stilled anxiety for more than she
      actually enjoyed. An equivocal position was of no importance to her then;
      she had no envy for the honors of a dull, disregarded wife: the one spot
      which spoiled her vision of her new pleasant world, was the sense that she
      left her three-year-old boy, who died two years afterward, and whose first
      tones saying &ldquo;mamma&rdquo; retained a difference from those of the
      children that came after. But now the years had brought many changes
      besides those in the contour of her cheek and throat; and that Grandcourt
      should marry her had become her dominant desire. The equivocal position
      which she had not minded about for herself was now telling upon her
      through her children, whom she loved with a devotion charged with the
      added passion of atonement. She had no repentance except in this
      direction. If Grandcourt married her, the children would be none the worse
      off for what had passed: they would see their mother in a dignified
      position, and they would be at no disadvantage with the world: her son
      could be made his father&rsquo;s heir. It was the yearning for this result
      which gave the supreme importance to Grandcourt&rsquo;s feeling for her;
      her love for him had long resolved itself into anxiety that he should give
      her the unique, permanent claim of a wife, and she expected no other
      happiness in marriage than the satisfaction of her maternal love and pride&mdash;including
      her pride for herself in the presence of her children. For the sake of
      that result she was prepared even with a tragic firmness to endure
      anything quietly in marriage; and she had acuteness enough to cherish
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s flickering purpose negatively, by not molesting him
      with passionate appeals and with scene-making. In her, as in every one
      else who wanted anything of him, his incalculable turns, and his tendency
      to harden under beseeching, had created a reasonable dread:&mdash;a slow
      discovery, of which no presentiment had been given in the bearing of a
      youthful lover with a fine line of face and the softest manners. But
      reticence had necessarily cost something to this impassioned woman, and
      she was the bitterer for it. There is no quailing&mdash;even that forced
      on the helpless and injured&mdash;which has not an ugly obverse: the
      withheld sting was gathering venom. She was absolutely dependent on
      Grandcourt; for though he had been always liberal in expenses for her, he
      had kept everything voluntary on his part; and with the goal of marriage
      before her, she would ask for nothing less. He had said that he would
      never settle anything except by will; and when she was thinking of
      alternatives for the future it often occurred to her that, even if she did
      not become Grandcourt&rsquo;s wife, he might never have a son who would
      have a legitimate claim on him, and the end might be that her son would be
      made heir to the best part of his estates. No son at that early age could
      promise to have more of his father&rsquo;s physique. But her becoming
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s wife was so far from being an extravagant notion of
      possibility, that even Lush had entertained it, and had said that he would
      as soon bet on it as on any other likelihood with regard to his familiar
      companion. Lush, indeed, on inferring that Grandcourt had a preconception
      of using his residence at Diplow in order to win Miss Arrowpoint, had
      thought it well to fan that project, taking it as a tacit renunciation of
      the marriage with Mrs. Glasher, which had long been a mark for the
      hovering and wheeling of Grandcourt&rsquo;s caprice. But both prospects
      had been negatived by Gwendolen&rsquo;s appearance on the scene; and it
      was natural enough for Mrs. Glasher to enter with eagerness into Lush&rsquo;s
      plan of hindering that new danger by setting up a barrier in the mind of
      the girl who was being sought as a bride. She entered into it with an
      eagerness which had passion in it as well as purpose, some of the
      stored-up venom delivering itself in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, she had heard from Lush of Gwendolen&rsquo;s departure, and
      the probability that all danger from her was got rid of; but there had
      been no letter to tell her that the danger had returned and had become a
      certainty. She had since then written to Grandcourt, as she did
      habitually, and he had been longer than usual in answering. She was
      inferring that he might intend coming to Gadsmere at the time when he was
      actually on the way; and she was not without hope&mdash;what construction
      of another&rsquo;s mind is not strong wishing equal to?&mdash;that a
      certain sickening from that frustrated courtship might dispose him to slip
      the more easily into the old track of intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt had two grave purposes in coming to Gadsmere: to convey the
      news of his approaching marriage in person, in order to make this first
      difficulty final; and to get from Lydia his mother&rsquo;s diamonds, which
      long ago he had confided to her and wished her to wear. Her person suited
      diamonds, and made them look as if they were worth some of the money given
      for them. These particular diamonds were not mountains of light&mdash;they
      were mere peas and haricots for the ears, neck and hair; but they were
      worth some thousands, and Grandcourt necessarily wished to have them for
      his wife. Formerly when he had asked Lydia to put them into his keeping
      again, simply on the ground that they would be safer and ought to be
      deposited at the bank, she had quietly but absolutely refused, declaring
      that they were quite safe; and at last had said, &ldquo;If you ever marry
      another woman I will give them up to her: are you going to marry another
      woman?&rdquo; At that time Grandcourt had no motive which urged him to
      persist, and he had this grace in him, that the disposition to exercise
      power either by cowing or disappointing others or exciting in them a rage
      which they dared not express&mdash;a disposition which was active in him
      as other propensities became languid&mdash;had always been in abeyance
      before Lydia. A severe interpreter might say that the mere facts of their
      relation to each other, the melancholy position of this woman who depended
      on his will, made a standing banquet for his delight in dominating. But
      there was something else than this in his forbearance toward her: there
      was the surviving though metamorphosed effect of the power she had had
      over him; and it was this effect, the fitful dull lapse toward
      solicitations that once had the zest now missing from life, which had
      again and again inclined him to espouse a familiar past rather than rouse
      himself to the expectation of novelty. But now novelty had taken hold of
      him and urged him to make the most of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Glasher was seated in the pleasant room where she habitually passed
      her mornings with her children round her. It had a square projecting
      window and looked on broad gravel and grass, sloping toward a little brook
      that entered the pool. The top of a low, black cabinet, the old oak table,
      the chairs in tawny leather, were littered with the children&rsquo;s toys,
      books and garden garments, at which a maternal lady in pastel looked down
      from the walls with smiling indulgence. The children were all there. The
      three girls, seated round their mother near the widow, were miniature
      portraits of her&mdash;dark-eyed, delicate-featured brunettes with a rich
      bloom on their cheeks, their little nostrils and eyebrows singularly
      finished as if they were tiny women, the eldest being barely nine. The boy
      was seated on the carpet at some distance, bending his blonde head over
      the animals from a Noah&rsquo;s ark, admonishing them separately in a
      voice of threatening command, and occasionally licking the spotted ones to
      see if the colors would hold. Josephine, the eldest, was having her French
      lesson; and the others, with their dolls on their laps, sat demurely
      enough for images of the Madonna. Mrs. Glasher&rsquo;s toilet had been
      made very carefully&mdash;each day now she said to herself that Grandcourt
      might come in. Her head, which, spite of emaciation, had an ineffaceable
      beauty in the fine profile, crisp curves of hair, and clearly-marked
      eyebrows, rose impressively above her bronze-colored silk and velvet, and
      the gold necklace which Grandcourt had first clasped round her neck years
      ago. Not that she had any pleasure in her toilet; her chief thought of
      herself seen in the glass was, &ldquo;How changed!&rdquo;&mdash;but such
      good in life as remained to her she would keep. If her chief wish were
      fulfilled, she could imagine herself getting the comeliness of a matron
      fit for the highest rank. The little faces beside her, almost exact
      reductions of her own, seemed to tell of the blooming curves which had
      once been where now was sunken pallor. But the children kissed the pale
      cheeks and never found them deficient. That love was now the one end of
      her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Mrs. Glasher turned away her head from Josephine&rsquo;s book and
      listened. &ldquo;Hush, dear! I think some one is coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Henleigh the boy jumped up and said, &ldquo;Mamma, is it the miller with
      my donkey?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He got no answer, and going up to his mamma&rsquo;s knee repeated his
      question in an insistent tone. But the door opened, and the servant
      announced Mr. Grandcourt. Mrs. Glasher rose in some agitation. Henleigh
      frowned at him in disgust at his not being the miller, and the three
      little girls lifted up their dark eyes to him timidly. They had none of
      them any particular liking for this friend of mamma&rsquo;s&mdash;in fact,
      when he had taken Mrs. Glasher&rsquo;s hand and then turned to put his
      other hand on Henleigh&rsquo;s head, that energetic scion began to beat
      the friend&rsquo;s arm away with his fists. The little girls submitted
      bashfully to be patted under the chin and kissed, but on the whole it
      seemed better to send them into the garden, where they were presently
      dancing and chatting with the dogs on the gravel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far are you come?&rdquo; said Mrs. Glasher, as Grandcourt put
      away his hat and overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Diplow,&rdquo; he answered slowly, seating himself opposite
      her and looking at her with an unnoting gaze which she noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are tired, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I rested at the Junction&mdash;a hideous hole. These railway
      journeys are always a confounded bore. But I had coffee and smoked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt drew out his handkerchief, rubbed his face, and in returning
      the handkerchief to his pocket looked at his crossed knee and blameless
      boot, as if any stranger were opposite to him, instead of a woman
      quivering with a suspense which every word and look of his was to incline
      toward hope or dread. But he was really occupied with their interview and
      what it was likely to include. Imagine the difference in rate of emotion
      between this woman whom the years had worn to a more conscious dependence
      and sharper eagerness, and this man whom they were dulling into a more
      neutral obstinacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected to see you&mdash;it was so long since I had heard from
      you. I suppose the weeks seem longer at Gadsmere than they do at Diplow,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Glasher. She had a quick, incisive way of speaking that seemed
      to go with her features, as the tone and <i>timbre</i> of a violin go with
      its form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; drawled Grandcourt. &ldquo;But you found the money paid
      into the bank.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Glasher, curtly, tingling with
      impatience. Always before&mdash;at least she fancied so&mdash;Grandcourt
      had taken more notice of her and the children than he did to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he resumed, playing with his whisker, and at first not
      looking at her, &ldquo;the time has gone on at rather a rattling pace with
      me; generally it is slow enough. But there has been a good deal happening,
      as you know&rdquo;&mdash;here he turned his eyes upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I know?&rdquo; said she, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left a pause before he said, without change of manner, &ldquo;That I
      was thinking of marrying. You saw Miss Harleth?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>She</i> told you that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The pale cheeks looked even paler, perhaps from the fierce brightness in
      the eyes above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Lush told me,&rdquo; was the slow answer. It was as if the
      thumb-screw and the iron boot were being placed by creeping hands within
      sight of the expectant victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! say at once that you are going to marry her,&rdquo; she
      burst out, passionately, her knees shaking and her hands tightly clasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, this kind of thing must happen some time or other,
      Lydia,&rdquo; said he; really, now the thumb-screw was on, not wishing to
      make the pain worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t always see the necessity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not. I see it now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In those few under-toned words of Grandcourt&rsquo;s she felt as absolute
      a resistance as if her thin fingers had been pushing at a fast shut iron
      door. She knew her helplessness, and shrank from testing it by any appeal&mdash;shrank
      from crying in a dead ear and clinging to dead knees, only to see the
      immovable face and feel the rigid limbs. She did not weep nor speak; she
      was too hard pressed by the sudden certainty which had as much of chill
      sickness in it as of thought and emotion. The defeated clutch of
      struggling hope gave her in these first moments a horrible sensation. At
      last she rose, with a spasmodic effort, and, unconscious of every thing
      but her wretchedness, pressed her forehead against the hard, cold glass of
      the window. The children, playing on the gravel, took this as a sign that
      she wanted them, and, running forward, stood in front of her with their
      sweet faces upturned expectantly. This roused her: she shook her head at
      them, waved them off, and overcome with this painful exertion, sank back
      in the nearest chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt had risen too. He was doubly annoyed&mdash;at the scene itself,
      and at the sense that no imperiousness of his could save him from it; but
      the task had to be gone through, and there was the administrative
      necessity of arranging things so that there should be as little annoyance
      as possible in the future. He was leaning against the corner of the
      fire-place. She looked up at him and said, bitterly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is of no consequence to you. I and the children are
      importunate creatures. You wish to get away again and be with Miss
      Harleth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make the affair more disagreeable than it need be.
      Lydia. It is of no use to harp on things that can&rsquo;t be altered. Of
      course, its deucedly disagreeable to me to see you making yourself
      miserable. I&rsquo;ve taken this journey to tell you what you must make up
      your mind to&mdash;you and the children will be provided for as usual&mdash;and
      there&rsquo;s an end of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence. She dared not answer. This woman with the intense, eager look had
      had the iron of the mother&rsquo;s anguish in her soul, and it had made
      her sometimes capable of a repression harder than shrieking and struggle.
      But underneath the silence there was an outlash of hatred and
      vindictiveness: she wished that the marriage might make two others
      wretched, besides herself. Presently he went on,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be better for you. You may go on living here. But I think
      of by-and-by settling a good sum on you and the children, and you can live
      where you like. There will be nothing for you to complain of then.
      Whatever happens, you will feel secure. Nothing could be done beforehand.
      Every thing has gone on in a hurry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt ceased his slow delivery of sentences. He did not expect her to
      thank him, but he considered that she might reasonably be contented; if it
      were possible for Lydia to be contented. She showed no change, and after a
      minute he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never had any reason to fear that I should be illiberal. I
      don&rsquo;t care a curse about the money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you did care about it, I suppose you would not give it us,&rdquo;
      said Lydia. The sarcasm was irrepressible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a devilishly unfair thing to say,&rdquo; Grandcourt
      replied, in a lower tone; &ldquo;and I advise you not to say that sort of
      thing again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you punish me by leaving the children in beggary?&rdquo; In
      spite of herself, the one outlet of venom had brought the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no question about leaving the children in beggary,&rdquo;
      said Grandcourt, still in his low voice. &ldquo;I advise you not to say
      things that you will repent of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am used to repenting,&rdquo; said she, bitterly. &ldquo;Perhaps
      you will repent. You have already repented of loving me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this will only make it uncommonly difficult for us to meet
      again. What friend have you besides me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words came like a low moan. At the same moment there flashed through
      her the wish that after promising himself a better happiness than that he
      had had with her, he might feel a misery and loneliness which would drive
      him back to her to find some memory of a time when he was young, glad, and
      hopeful. But no! he would go scathless; it was she that had to suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this the scorching words were ended. Grandcourt had meant to stay
      till evening; he wished to curtail his visit, but there was no suitable
      train earlier than the one he had arranged to go by, and he had still to
      speak to Lydia on the second object of his visit, which like a second
      surgical operation seemed to require an interval. The hours had to go by;
      there was eating to be done; the children came in&mdash;all this mechanism
      of life had to be gone through with the dreary sense of constraint which
      is often felt in domestic quarrels of a commoner kind. To Lydia it was
      some slight relief for her stifled fury to have the children present: she
      felt a savage glory in their loveliness, as if it would taunt Grandcourt
      with his indifference to her and them&mdash;a secret darting of venom
      which was strongly imaginative. He acquitted himself with all the
      advantage of a man whose grace of bearing has long been moulded on an
      experience of boredom&mdash;nursed the little Antonia, who sat with her
      hands crossed and eyes upturned to his bald head, which struck her as
      worthy of observation&mdash;and propitiated Henleigh by promising him a
      beautiful saddle and bridle. It was only the two eldest girls who had
      known him as a continual presence; and the intervening years had overlaid
      their infantine memories with a bashfulness which Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      bearing was not likely to dissipate. He and Lydia occasionally, in the
      presence of the servants, made a conventional remark; otherwise they never
      spoke; and the stagnant thought in Grandcourt&rsquo;s mind all the while
      was of his own infatuation in having given her those diamonds, which
      obliged him to incur the nuisance of speaking about them. He had an
      ingrained care for what he held to belong to his caste, and about property
      he liked to be lordly; also he had a consciousness of indignity to himself
      in having to ask for anything in the world. But however he might assert
      his independence of Mrs. Glasher&rsquo;s past, he had made a past for
      himself which was a stronger yoke than any he could impose. He must ask
      for the diamonds which he had promised to Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they were alone again, with the candles above them, face to face
      with each other. Grandcourt looked at his watch, and then said, in an
      apparently indifferent drawl, &ldquo;There is one thing I had to mention,
      Lydia. My diamonds&mdash;you have them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have them,&rdquo; she answered promptly, rising and standing
      with her arms thrust down and her fingers threaded, while Grandcourt sat
      still. She had expected the topic, and made her resolve about it. But she
      meant to carry out her resolve, if possible, without exasperating him.
      During the hours of silence she had longed to recall the words which had
      only widened the breach between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are in this house, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not in this house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you said you kept them by you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I said so it was true. They are in the bank at Dudley.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get them away, will you? I must make an arrangement for your
      delivering them to some one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make no arrangement. They shall be delivered to the person you
      intended them for. <i>I</i> will make the arrangement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say. I have always told you that I would give them up to
      your wife. I shall keep my word. She is not your wife yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is foolery,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, with undertoned disgust.
      It was too irritating that this indulgence of Lydia had given her a sort
      of mastery over him in spite of dependent condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not speak. He also rose now, but stood leaning against the
      mantle-piece with his side-face toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The diamonds must be delivered to me before my marriage,&rdquo; he
      began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your wedding-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tenth. There is no time to be lost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where do you go after the marriage?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply except by looking more sullen. Presently he said, &ldquo;You
      must appoint a day before then, to get them from the bank and meet me&mdash;or
      somebody else I will commission;&mdash;it&rsquo;s a great nuisance.
      Mention a day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I shall not do that. They shall be delivered to her safely. I
      shall keep my word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, just audibly, turning
      to face her, &ldquo;that you will not do as I tell you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I mean that,&rdquo; was the answer that leaped out, while her
      eyes flashed close to him. The poor creature was immediately conscious
      that if her words had any effect on her own lot, the effect must be
      mischievous, and might nullify all the remaining advantage of her long
      patience. But the word had been spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in a position the most irritating to him. He could not shake her
      nor touch her hostilely; and if he could, the process would not bring his
      mother&rsquo;s diamonds. He shrank from the only sort of threat that would
      frighten her&mdash;if she believed it. And in general, there was nothing
      he hated more than to be forced into anything like violence even in words:
      his will must impose itself without trouble. After looking at her for a
      moment, he turned his side-face toward her again, leaning as before, and
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infernal idiots that women are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why will you not tell me where you are going after the marriage? I
      could be at the wedding if I liked, and learn in that way,&rdquo; said
      Lydia, not shrinking from the one suicidal form of threat within her
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if you like, you can play the mad woman,&rdquo; said
      Grandcourt, with <i>sotto voce</i> scorn. &ldquo;It is not to be supposed
      that you will wait to think what good will come of it&mdash;or what you
      owe to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in a state of disgust and embitterment quite new in the history of
      their relation to each other. It was undeniable that this woman, whose
      life he had allowed to send such deep suckers into his, had a terrible
      power of annoyance in her; and the rash hurry of his proceedings had left
      her opportunities open. His pride saw very ugly possibilities threatening
      it, and he stood for several minutes in silence reviewing the situation&mdash;considering
      how he could act upon her. Unlike himself she was of a direct nature, with
      certain simple strongly-colored tendencies, and there was one
      often-experienced effect which he thought he could count upon now. As Sir
      Hugo had said of him, Grandcourt knew how to play his cards upon occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak again, but looked at his watch, rang the bell, and
      ordered the vehicle to be brought round immediately. Then he removed
      farther from her, walked as if in expectation of a summons, and remained
      silent without turning his eyes upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was suffering the horrible conflict of self-reproach and tenacity. She
      saw beforehand Grandcourt leaving her without even looking at her again&mdash;herself
      left behind in lonely uncertainty&mdash;hearing nothing from him&mdash;not
      knowing whether she had done her children harm&mdash;feeling that she had
      perhaps made him hate her;&mdash;all the wretchedness of a creature who
      had defeated her own motives. And yet she could not bear to give up a
      purpose which was a sweet morsel to her vindictiveness. If she had not
      been a mother she would willingly have sacrificed herself to her revenge&mdash;to
      what she felt to be the justice of hindering another from getting
      happiness by willingly giving her over to misery. The two dominant
      passions were at struggle. She must satisfy them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us part in anger, Henleigh,&rdquo; she began,
      without changing her voice or attitude: &ldquo;it is a very little thing I
      ask. If I were refusing to give anything up that you call yours it would
      be different: that would be a reason for treating me as if you hated me.
      But I ask such a little thing. If you will tell me where you are going on
      the wedding-day I will take care that the diamonds shall be delivered to
      her without scandal. Without scandal,&rdquo; she repeated entreatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such preposterous whims make a woman odious,&rdquo; said
      Grandcourt, not giving way in look or movement. &ldquo;What is the use of
      talking to mad people?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am foolish&mdash;loneliness has made me foolish&mdash;indulge
      me.&rdquo; Sobs rose as she spoke. &ldquo;If you will indulge me in this
      one folly I will be very meek&mdash;I will never trouble you.&rdquo; She
      burst into hysterical crying, and said again almost with a scream&mdash;&ldquo;I
      will be very meek after that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a strange mixture of acting and reality in this passion. She
      kept hold of her purpose as a child might tighten its hand over a small
      stolen thing, crying and denying all the while. Even Grandcourt was
      wrought upon by surprise: this capricious wish, this childish violence,
      was as unlike Lydia&rsquo;s bearing as it was incongruous with her person.
      Both had always had a stamp of dignity on them. Yet she seemed more
      manageable in this state than in her former attitude of defiance. He came
      close up to her again, and said, in his low imperious tone, &ldquo;Be
      quiet, and hear what I tell you, I will never forgive you if you present
      yourself again and make a scene.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her handkerchief against her face, and when she could speak
      firmly said, in the muffled voice that follows sobbing, &ldquo;I will not&mdash;if
      you will let me have my way&mdash;I promise you not to thrust myself
      forward again. I have never broken my word to you&mdash;how many have you
      broken to me? When you gave me the diamonds to wear you were not thinking
      of having another wife. And I now give them up&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      reproach you&mdash;I only ask you to let me give them up in my own way.
      Have I not borne it well? Everything is to be taken away from me, and when
      I ask for a straw, a chip&mdash;you deny it me.&rdquo; She had spoken
      rapidly, but after a little pause she said more slowly, her voice freed
      from its muffled tone: &ldquo;I will not bear to have it denied me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt had a baffling sense that he had to deal with something like
      madness; he could only govern by giving way. The servant came to say the
      fly was ready. When the door was shut again Grandcourt said sullenly,
      &ldquo;We are going to Ryelands then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall be delivered to her there,&rdquo; said Lydia, with
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I am going.&rdquo; He felt no inclination even to take
      her hand: she had annoyed him too sorely. But now that she had gained her
      point, she was prepared to humble herself that she might propitiate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me; I will never vex you again,&rdquo; she said, with
      beseeching looks. Her inward voice said distinctly&mdash;&ldquo;It is only
      I who have to forgive.&rdquo; Yet she was obliged to ask forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better keep that promise. You have made me feel uncommonly
      ill with your folly,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, apparently choosing this
      statement as the strongest possible use of language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; cried Lydia, with a faint smile;&mdash;was he
      aware of the minor fact that he made her feel ill this morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      But with the quick transition natural to her, she was now ready to coax
      him if he would let her, that they might part in some degree reconciled.
      She ventured to lay her hand on his shoulder, and he did not move away
      from her: she had so far succeeded in alarming him, that he was not sorry
      for these proofs of returned subjection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light a cigar,&rdquo; she said, soothingly, taking the case from
      his breast-pocket and opening it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst such caressing signs of mutual fear they parted. The effect that
      clung and gnawed within Grandcourt was a sense of imperfect mastery.

      CHAPTER XXXI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;A wild dedication of yourselves
  To unpath&rsquo;d waters, undreamed shores.&rdquo;
                             &mdash;SHAKESPEARE.
</pre>
    <p>
      On the day when Gwendolen Harleth was married and became Mrs. Grandcourt,
      the morning was clear and bright, and while the sun was low a slight frost
      crisped the leaves. The bridal party was worth seeing, and half Pennicote
      turned out to see it, lining the pathway up to the church. An old friend
      of the rector&rsquo;s performed the marriage ceremony, the rector himself
      acting as father, to the great advantage of the procession. Only two
      faces, it was remarked, showed signs of sadness&mdash;Mrs. Davilow&rsquo;s
      and Anna&rsquo;s. The mother&rsquo;s delicate eyelids were pink, as if she
      had been crying half the night; and no one was surprised that, splendid as
      the match was, she should feel the parting from a daughter who was the
      flower of her children and of her own life. It was less understood why
      Anna should be troubled when she was being so well set off by the
      bridesmaid&rsquo;s dress. Every one else seemed to reflect the brilliancy
      of the occasion&mdash;the bride most of all. Of her it was agreed that as
      to figure and carriage she was worthy to be a &ldquo;lady o&rsquo; title&rdquo;:
      as to face, perhaps it might be thought that a title required something
      more rosy; but the bridegroom himself not being fresh-colored&mdash;being
      indeed, as the miller&rsquo;s wife observed, very much of her own husband&rsquo;s
      complexion&mdash;the match was the more complete. Anyhow he must be very
      fond of her; and it was to be hoped that he would never cast it up to her
      that she had been going out to service as a governess, and her mother to
      live at Sawyer&rsquo;s Cottage&mdash;vicissitudes which had been much
      spoken of in the village. The miller&rsquo;s daughter of fourteen could
      not believe that high gentry behaved badly to their wives, but her mother
      instructed her&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, child, men&rsquo;s men: gentle or simple,
      they&rsquo;re much of a muchness. I&rsquo;ve heard my mother say Squire
      Pelton used to take his dogs and a long whip into his wife&rsquo;s room,
      and flog &lsquo;em there to frighten her; and my mother was lady&rsquo;s-maid
      there at the very time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s unlucky talk for a wedding, Mrs. Girdle,&rdquo; said
      the tailor. &ldquo;A quarrel may end wi&rsquo; the whip, but it begins wi&rsquo;
      the tongue, and it&rsquo;s the women have got the most o&rsquo; that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord gave it &lsquo;em to use, I suppose,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Girdle. &ldquo;<i>He</i> never meant you to have it all your own way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what I can make out from the gentleman as attends to the
      grooming at Offendene,&rdquo; said the tailor, &ldquo;this Mr. Grandcourt
      has wonderful little tongue. Everything must be done dummy-like without
      his ordering.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s the more whip, I doubt,&rdquo; said Mrs. Girdle.
      &ldquo;<i>She&rsquo;s</i> got tongue enough, I warrant her. See, there
      they come out together!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wonderful long corners she&rsquo;s got to her eyes!&rdquo;
      said the tailor. &ldquo;She makes you feel comical when she looks at you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen, in fact, never showed more elasticity in her bearing, more
      lustre in her long brown glance: she had the brilliancy of strong
      excitement, which will sometimes come even from pain. It was not pain,
      however, that she was feeling: she had wrought herself up to much the same
      condition as that in which she stood at the gambling-table when Deronda
      was looking at her, and she began to lose. There was an enjoyment in it:
      whatever uneasiness a growing conscience had created was disregarded as an
      ailment might have been, amidst the gratification of that ambitious vanity
      and desire for luxury within her which it would take a great deal of slow
      poisoning to kill. This morning she could not have said truly that she
      repented her acceptance of Grandcourt, or that any fears in hazy
      perspective could hinder the glowing effect of the immediate scene in
      which she was the central object. That she was doing something wrong&mdash;that
      a punishment might be hanging over her&mdash;that the woman to whom she
      had given a promise and broken it, was thinking of her in bitterness and
      misery with a just reproach&mdash;that Deronda with his way of looking
      into things very likely despised her for marrying Grandcourt, as he had
      despised her for gambling&mdash;above all, that the cord which united her
      with this lover and which she had heretofore held by the hand, was now
      being flung over her neck,&mdash;all this yeasty mingling of dimly
      understood facts with vague but deep impressions, and with images half
      real, half fantastic, had been disturbing her during the weeks of her
      engagement. Was that agitating experience nullified this morning? No: it
      was surmounted and thrust down with a sort of exulting defiance as she
      felt herself standing at the game of life with many eyes upon her, daring
      everything to win much&mdash;or if to lose, still with <i>éclat</i> and a
      sense of importance. But this morning a losing destiny for herself did not
      press upon her as a fear: she thought that she was entering on a fuller
      power of managing circumstances&mdash;with all the official strength of
      marriage, which some women made so poor a use of. That intoxication of
      youthful egoism out of which she had been shaken by trouble, humiliation,
      and a new sense of culpability, had returned upon her under a newly-fed
      strength of the old fumes. She did not in the least present the ideal of
      the tearful, tremulous bride. Poor Gwendolen, whom some had judged much
      too forward and instructed in the world&rsquo;s ways!&mdash;with her erect
      head and elastic footstep she was walking among illusions; and yet, too,
      there was an under-consciousness of her that she was a little intoxicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God you bear it so well, my darling!&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow, when she had helped Gwendolen to doff her bridal white and put on
      her traveling dress. All the trembling had been done by the poor mother,
      and her agitation urged Gwendolen doubly to take the morning as if it were
      a triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you might have said that, if I had been going to Mrs. Mompert&rsquo;s,
      you dear, sad, incorrigible mamma!&rdquo; said Gwendolen just putting her
      hands to her mother&rsquo;s cheeks with laughing tenderness&mdash;then
      retreating a little and spreading out her arms as if to exhibit herself:
      &ldquo;Here am I&mdash;Mrs. Grandcourt! what else would you have me, but
      what I am sure to be? You know you were ready to die with vexation when
      you thought that I would not be Mrs. Grandcourt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush, my child, for heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow, almost in a whisper. &ldquo;How can I help feeling it when I am
      parting from you. But I can bear anything gladly if you are happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not gladly, mamma, no!&rdquo; said Gwendolen, shaking her head,
      with a bright smile. &ldquo;Willingly you would bear it, but always
      sorrowfully. Sorrowing is your sauce; you can take nothing without it.&rdquo;
      Then, clasping her mother&rsquo;s shoulders and raining kisses first on
      one cheek and then on the other between her words, she said, gaily,
      &ldquo;And you shall sorrow over my having everything at my beck&mdash;-and
      enjoying everything glorious&mdash;splendid houses&mdash;and horses&mdash;and
      diamonds, I shall have diamonds&mdash;and going to court&mdash;and being
      Lady Certainly&mdash;and Lady Perhaps&mdash;and grand here&mdash;and
      tantivy there&mdash;and always loving you better than anybody else in the
      world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sweet child!&mdash;But I shall not be jealous if you love your
      husband better; and he will expect to be first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen thrust out her lips and chin with a pretty grimace, saying,
      &ldquo;Rather a ridiculous expectation. However, I don&rsquo;t mean to
      treat him ill, unless he deserves it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the two fell into a clinging embrace, and Gwendolen could not hinder
      a rising sob when she said, &ldquo;I wish you were going with me, mamma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the slight dew on her long eyelashes only made her the more charming
      when she gave her hand to Grandcourt to be led to the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector looked in on her to give a final &ldquo;Good-bye; God bless
      you; we shall see you again before long,&rdquo; and then returned to Mrs.
      Davilow, saying half cheerfully, half solemnly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us be thankful, Fanny. She is in a position well suited to her,
      and beyond what I should have dared to hope for. And few women can have
      been chosen more entirely for their own sake. You should feel yourself a
      happy mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      There was a railway journey of some fifty miles before the new husband and
      wife reached the station near Ryelands. The sky had veiled itself since
      the morning, and it was hardly more than twilight when they entered the
      park-gates, but still Gwendolen, looking out of the carriage-window as
      they drove rapidly along, could see the grand outlines and the nearer
      beauties of the scene&mdash;the long winding drive bordered with
      evergreens backed by huge gray stems: then the opening of wide grassy
      spaces and undulations studded with dark clumps; till at last came a wide
      level where the white house could be seen, with a hanging wood for a
      back-ground, and the rising and sinking balustrade of a terrace in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen had been at her liveliest during the journey, chatting
      incessantly, ignoring any change in their mutual position since yesterday;
      and Grandcourt had been rather ecstatically quiescent, while she turned
      his gentle seizure of her hand into a grasp of his hand by both hers, with
      an increased vivacity as of a kitten that will not sit quiet to be petted.
      She was really getting somewhat febrile in her excitement; and now in this
      drive through the park her usual susceptibility to changes of light and
      scenery helped to make her heart palpitate newly. Was it at the novelty
      simply, or the almost incredible fulfilment about to be given to her
      girlish dreams of being &ldquo;somebody&rdquo;&mdash;walking through her
      own furlong of corridor and under her own ceilings of an out-of-sight
      loftiness, where her own painted Spring was shedding painted flowers, and
      her own fore-shortened Zephyrs were blowing their trumpets over her; while
      her own servants, lackeys in clothing but men in bulk and shape, were as
      nought in her presence, and revered the propriety of her insolence to
      them:&mdash;being in short the heroine of an admired play without the
      pains of art? Was it alone the closeness of this fulfilment which made her
      heart flutter? or was it some dim forecast, the insistent penetration of
      suppressed experience, mixing the expectation of a triumph with the dread
      of a crisis? Hers was one of the natures in which exultation inevitably
      carries an infusion of dread ready to curdle and declare itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell silent in spite of herself as they approached the gates, and when
      her husband said, &ldquo;Here we are at home!&rdquo; and for the first
      time kissed her on the lips, she hardly knew of it: it was no more than
      the passive acceptance of a greeting in the midst of an absorbing show.
      Was not all her hurrying life of the last three months a show, in which
      her consciousness was a wondering spectator? After the half-willful
      excitement of the day, a numbness had come over her personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a brilliant light in the hall&mdash;warmth, matting,
      carpets, full-length portraits, Olympian statues, assiduous servants. Not
      many servants, however: only a few from Diplow in addition to those
      constantly in charge of the house; and Gwendolen&rsquo;s new maid, who had
      come with her, was taken under guidance by the housekeeper. Gwendolen felt
      herself being led by Grandcourt along a subtly-scented corridor, into an
      ante-room where she saw an open doorway sending out a rich glow of light
      and color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are our dens,&rdquo; said Grandcourt. &ldquo;You will like to
      be quiet here till dinner. We shall dine early.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hand to his lips and moved away, more in love than he had
      ever expected to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen, yielded up her hat and mantle, threw herself into a chair by
      the glowing hearth, and saw herself repeated in glass panels with all her
      faint-green satin surroundings. The housekeeper had passed into this
      boudoir from the adjoining dressing-room and seemed disposed to linger,
      Gwendolen thought, in order to look at the new mistress of Ryelands, who,
      however, being impatient for solitude said to her, &ldquo;Will you tell
      Hudson when she has put out my dress to leave everything? I shall not want
      her again, unless I ring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper, coming forward, said, &ldquo;Here is a packet, madam,
      which I was ordered to give into nobody&rsquo;s hands but yours, when you
      were alone. The person who brought it said it was a present particularly
      ordered by Mr. Grandcourt; but he was not to know of its arrival till he
      saw you wear it. Excuse me, madam; I felt it right to obey orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen took the packet and let it lie on her lap till she heard the
      doors close. It came into her mind that the packet might contain the
      diamonds which Grandcourt had spoken of as being deposited somewhere and
      to be given to her on her marriage. In this moment of confused feeling and
      creeping luxurious languor she was glad of this diversion&mdash;glad of
      such an event as having her own diamonds to try on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within all the sealed paper coverings was a box, but within the box there
      <i>was</i> a jewel-case; and now she felt no doubt that she had the
      diamonds. But on opening the case, in the same instant that she saw them
      gleam she saw a letter lying above them. She knew the handwriting of the
      address. It was as if an adder had lain on them. Her heart gave a leap
      which seemed to have spent all her strength; and as she opened the bit of
      thin paper, it shook with the trembling of her hands. But it was legible
      as print, and thrust its words upon her.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    These diamonds, which were once given with ardent love to Lydia
    Glasher, she passes on to you. You have broken your word to her, that
    you might possess what was hers. Perhaps you think of being happy, as
    she once was, and of having beautiful children such as hers, who will
    thrust hers aside. God is too just for that. The man you have married
    has a withered heart. His best young love was mine: you could not take
    that from me when you took the rest. It is dead: but I am the grave
    in which your chance of happiness is buried as well as mine. You had
    your warning. You have chosen to injure me and my children. He had
    meant to marry me. He would have married me at last, if you had not
    broken your word. You will have your punishment. I desire it with all
    my soul.

    Will you give him this letter to set him against me and ruin us
    more&mdash;me and my children? Shall you like to stand before your husband
    with these diamonds on you, and these words of mine in his thoughts and
    yours? Will he think you have any right to complain when he has made
    you miserable? You took him with your eyes open. The willing wrong you
    have done me will be your curse.
</pre>
    <p>
      It seemed at first as if Gwendolen&rsquo;s eyes were spell-bound in
      reading the horrible words of the letter over and over again as a doom of
      penance; but suddenly a new spasm of terror made her lean forward and
      stretch out the paper toward the fire, lest accusation and proof at once
      should meet all eyes. It flew like a feather from her trembling fingers
      and was caught up in a great draught of flame. In her movement the casket
      fell on the floor and the diamonds rolled out. She took no notice, but
      fell back in her chair again helpless. She could not see the reflections
      of herself then; they were like so many women petrified white; but coming
      near herself you might have seen the tremor in her lips and hands. She sat
      so for a long while, knowing little more than that she was feeling ill,
      and that those written words kept repeating themselves to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly here were poisoned gems, and the poison had entered into this poor
      young creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that long while, there was a tap at the door and Grandcourt entered,
      dressed for dinner. The sight of him brought a new nervous shock, and
      Gwendolen screamed again and again with hysterical violence. He had
      expected to see her dressed and smiling, ready to be led down. He saw her
      pallid, shrieking as it seemed with terror, the jewels scattered around
      her on the floor. Was it a fit of madness?
    </p>
    <p>
      In some form or other the furies had crossed his threshold.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    In all ages it hath been a favorite text that a potent love hath the
    nature of an isolated fatality, whereto the mind&rsquo;s opinions and wonted
    resolves are altogether alien; as, for example, Daphnis his frenzy,
    wherein it had little availed him to have been convinced of Heraclitus
    his doctrine; or the philtre-bred passion of Tristan, who, though he
    had been as deep as Duns Scotus, would have had his reasoning marred
    by that cup too much; or Romeo in his sudden taking for Juliet,
    wherein any objections he might have held against Ptolemy had made
    little difference to his discourse under the balcony. Yet all love is
    not such, even though potent; nay, this passion hath as large scope as
    any for allying itself with every operation of the soul: so that it
    shall acknowledge an effect from the imagined light of unproven
    firmaments, and have its scale set to the grander orbits of what hath
    been and shall be.

    <p>
      Deronda, on his return to town, could assure Sir Hugo of his having lodged
      in Grandcourt&rsquo;s mind a distinct understanding that he could get
      fifty thousand pounds by giving up a prospect which was probably distant,
      and not absolutely certain; but he had no further sign of Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      disposition in the matter than that he was evidently inclined to keep up
      friendly communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you think of the future bride on a nearer survey?&rdquo;
      said Sir Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought better of her than I did in Leubronn. Roulette was not a
      good setting for her; it brought out something of the demon. At Diplow she
      seemed much more womanly and attractive&mdash;less hard and
      self-possessed. I thought her mouth and eyes had quite a different
      expression.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t flirt with her too much, Dan,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo,
      meaning to be agreeably playful. &ldquo;If you make Grandcourt savage when
      they come to the Abbey at Christmas, it will interfere with my affairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can stay in town, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. Lady Mallinger and the children can&rsquo;t do without you
      at Christmas. Only don&rsquo;t make mischief&mdash;unless you can get up a
      duel, and manage to shoot Grandcourt, which might be worth a little
      inconvenience.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ever saw me flirt,&rdquo; said Deronda, not
      amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, haven&rsquo;t I, though?&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, provokingly.
      &ldquo;You are always looking tenderly at the women, and talking to them
      in a Jesuitical way. You are a dangerous young fellow&mdash;a kind of
      Lovelace who will make the Clarissas run after you instead of you running
      after them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the use of being exasperated at a tasteless joke?&mdash;only the
      exasperation comes before the reflection on utility. Few friendly remarks
      are more annoying than the information that we are always seeming to do
      what we never mean to do. Sir Hugo&rsquo;s notion of flirting, it was to
      be hoped, was rather peculiar; for his own part, Deronda was sure that he
      had never flirted. But he was glad that the baronet had no knowledge about
      the repurchase of Gwendolen&rsquo;s necklace to feed his taste for this
      kind of rallying.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would be on his guard in future; for example, in his behavior at Mrs.
      Meyrick&rsquo;s, where he was about to pay his first visit since his
      arrival from Leubronn. For Mirah was certainly a creature in whom it was
      difficult not to show a tender kind of interest both by looks and speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Meyrick had not failed to send Deronda a report of Mirah&rsquo;s
      well-being in her family. &ldquo;We are getting fonder of her every day,&rdquo;
      she had written. &ldquo;At breakfast-time we all look toward the door with
      expectation to see her come in; and we watch her and listen to her as if
      she were a native from a new country. I have not heard a word from her
      lips that gives me a doubt about her. She is quite contented and full of
      gratitude. My daughters are learning from her, and they hope to get her
      other pupils; for she is anxious not to eat the bread of idleness, but to
      work, like my girls. Mab says our life has become like a fairy tale, and
      all she is afraid of is that Mirah will turn into a nightingale again and
      fly away from us. Her voice is just perfect: not loud and strong, but
      searching and melting, like the thoughts of what has been. That is the way
      old people like me feel a beautiful voice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Meyrick did not enter into particulars which would have required
      her to say that Amy and Mab, who had accompanied Mirah to the synagogue,
      found the Jewish faith less reconcilable with their wishes in her case
      than in that of Scott&rsquo;s Rebecca. They kept silence out of delicacy
      to Mirah, with whom her religion was too tender a subject to be touched
      lightly; but after a while Amy, who was much of a practical reformer,
      could not restrain a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Mirah, but <i>does</i> it seem quite right to you that
      the women should sit behind rails in a gallery apart?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I never thought of anything else,&rdquo; said Mirah, with mild
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you like better to see the men with their hats on?&rdquo; said
      Mab, cautiously proposing the smallest item of difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I like what I have always seen there, because it brings
      back to me the same feelings&mdash;the feelings I would not part with for
      anything else in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, any criticism, whether of doctrine or practice, would have
      seemed to these generous little people an inhospitable cruelty. Mirah&rsquo;s
      religion was of one fibre with her affections, and had never presented
      itself to her as a set of propositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says herself she is a very bad Jewess, and does not half know
      her people&rsquo;s religion,&rdquo; said Amy, when Mirah was gone to bed.
      &ldquo;Perhaps it would gradually melt away from her, and she would pass
      into Christianity like the rest of the world, if she got to love us very
      much, and never found her mother. It is so strange to be of the Jews&rsquo;
      religion now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo; cried Mab. &ldquo;I wish I were not such a
      hideous Christian. How can an ugly Christian, who is always dropping her
      work, convert a beautiful Jewess, who has not a fault?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be wicked of me,&rdquo; said shrewd Kate, &ldquo;but I
      cannot help wishing that her mother may not be found. There might be
      something unpleasant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick. &ldquo;I
      believe Mirah is cut out after the pattern of her mother. And what a joy
      it would be to her to have such a daughter brought back again! But a
      mother&rsquo;s feelings are not worth reckoning, I suppose&rdquo; (she
      shot a mischievous glance at her own daughters), &ldquo;and a dead mother
      is worth more than a living one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and so she may be, little mother,&rdquo; said Kate; &ldquo;but
      we would rather hold you cheaper, and have you alive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only the Meyricks, whose various knowledge had been acquired by the
      irregular foraging to which clever girls have usually been reduced, but
      Deronda himself, with all his masculine instruction, had been roused by
      this apparition of Mirah to the consciousness of knowing hardly anything
      about modern Judaism or the inner Jewish history. The Chosen People have
      been commonly treated as a people chosen for the sake of somebody else;
      and their thinking as something (no matter exactly what) that ought to
      have been entirely otherwise; and Deronda, like his neighbors, had
      regarded Judaism as a sort of eccentric fossilized form which an
      accomplished man might dispense with studying, and leave to specialists.
      But Mirah, with her terrified flight from one parent, and her yearning
      after the other, had flashed on him the hitherto neglected reality that
      Judaism was something still throbbing in human lives, still making for
      them the only conceivable vesture of the world; and in the idling
      excursion on which he immediately afterward set out with Sir Hugo he began
      to look for the outsides of synagogues, and the title of books about the
      Jews. This awakening of a new interest&mdash;this passing from the
      supposition that we hold the right opinions on a subject we are careless
      about, to a sudden care for it, and a sense that our opinions were
      ignorance&mdash;is an effectual remedy for <i>ennui</i>, which, unhappily,
      cannot be secured on a physician&rsquo;s prescription; but Deronda had
      carried it with him, and endured his weeks of lounging all the better. It
      was on this journey that he first entered a Jewish synagogue&mdash;at
      Frankfort&mdash;where his party rested on a Friday. In exploring the
      Juden-gasse, which he had seen long before, he remembered well enough its
      picturesque old houses; what his eyes chiefly dwelt on now were the human
      types there; and his thought, busily connecting them with the past phases
      of their race, stirred that fibre of historic sympathy which had helped to
      determine in him certain traits worth mentioning for those who are
      interested in his future. True, when a young man has a fine person, no
      eccentricity of manners, the education of a gentleman, and a present
      income, it is not customary to feel a prying curiosity about his way of
      thinking, or his peculiar tastes. He may very well be settled in life as
      an agreeable clever young fellow without passing a special examination on
      those heads. Later, when he is getting rather slovenly and portly, his
      peculiarities are more distinctly discerned, and it is taken as a mercy if
      they are not highly objectionable. But any one wishing to understand the
      effect of after-events on Deronda should know a little more of what he was
      at five-and-twenty than was evident in ordinary intercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that the very vividness of his impressions had often made him
      the more enigmatic to his friends, and had contributed to an apparent
      indefiniteness in his sentiments. His early-wakened sensibility and
      reflectiveness had developed into a many-sided sympathy, which threatened
      to hinder any persistent course of action: as soon as he took up any
      antagonism, though only in thought, he seemed to himself like the Sabine
      warriors in the memorable story&mdash;with nothing to meet his spear but
      flesh of his flesh, and objects that he loved. His imagination had so
      wrought itself to the habit of seeing things as they probably appeared to
      others, that a strong partisanship, unless it were against an immediate
      oppression, had become an insincerity for him. His plenteous, flexible
      sympathy had ended by falling into one current with that reflective
      analysis which tends to neutralize sympathy. Few men were able to keep
      themselves clearer of vices than he; yet he hated vices mildly, being used
      to think of them less in the abstract than as a part of mixed human
      natures having an individual history, which it was the bent of his mind to
      trace with understanding and pity. With the same innate balance he was
      fervidly democratic in his feeling for the multitude, and yet, through his
      affections and imagination, intensely conservative; voracious of
      speculations on government and religion, yet loth to part with
      long-sanctioned forms which, for him, were quick with memories and
      sentiments that no argument could lay dead. We fall on the leaning side;
      and Deronda suspected himself of loving too well the losing causes of the
      world. Martyrdom changes sides, and he was in danger of changing with it,
      having a strong repugnance to taking up that clue of success which the
      order of the world often forces upon us and makes it treason against the
      common weal to reject. And yet his fear of falling into an unreasoning
      narrow hatred made a check for him: he apologized for the heirs of
      privilege; he shrank with dislike from the loser&rsquo;s bitterness and
      the denunciatory tone of the unaccepted innovator. A too reflective and
      diffusive sympathy was in danger of paralyzing in him that indignation
      against wrong and that selectness of fellowship which are the conditions
      of moral force; and in the last few years of confirmed manhood he had
      become so keenly aware of this that what he most longed for was either
      some external event, or some inward light, that would urge him into a
      definite line of action, and compress his wandering energy. He was ceasing
      to care for knowledge&mdash;he had no ambition for practice&mdash;unless
      they could both be gathered up into one current with his emotions; and he
      dreaded, as if it were a dwelling-place of lost souls, that dead anatomy
      of culture which turns the universe into a mere ceaseless answer to
      queries, and knows, not everything, but everything else about everything&mdash;as
      if one should be ignorant of nothing concerning the scent of violets
      except the scent itself for which one had no nostril. But how and whence
      was the needed event to come?&mdash;the influence that would justify
      partiality, and make him what he longed to be, yet was unable to make
      himself&mdash;an organic part of social life, instead of roaming in it
      like a yearning disembodied spirit, stirred with a vague social passion,
      but without fixed local habitation to render fellowship real? To make a
      little difference for the better was what he was not contented to live
      without; but how to make it? It is one thing to see your road, another to
      cut it. He found some of the fault in his birth and the way he had been
      brought up, which had laid no special demands on him and had given him no
      fixed relationship except one of a doubtful kind; but he did not attempt
      to hide from himself that he had fallen into a meditative numbness, and
      was gliding farther and farther from that life of practically energetic
      sentiment which he would have proclaimed (if he had been inclined to
      proclaim anything) to be the best of all life, and for himself the only
      way worth living. He wanted some way of keeping emotion and its progeny of
      sentiments&mdash;which make the savors of life&mdash;substantial and
      strong in the face of a reflectiveness that threatened to nullify all
      differences. To pound the objects of sentiment into small dust, yet keep
      sentiment alive and active, was something like the famous recipe for
      making cannon&mdash;to first take a round hole and then enclose it with
      iron; whatever you do keeping fast hold of your round hole. Yet how
      distinguish what our will may wisely save in its completeness, from the
      heaping of cat-mummies and the expensive cult of enshrined putrefactions?
    </p>
    <p>
      Something like this was the common under-current in Deronda&rsquo;s mind
      while he was reading law or imperfectly attending to polite conversation.
      Meanwhile he had not set about one function in particular with zeal and
      steadiness. Not an admirable experience, to be proposed as an ideal; but a
      form of struggle before break of day which some young men since the
      patriarch have had to pass through, with more or less of bruising if not
      laming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that under his calm exterior he had a fervor which made him
      easily feel the presence of poetry in everyday events; and the forms of
      the Juden-gasse, rousing the sense of union with what is remote, set him
      musing on two elements of our historic life which that sense raises into
      the same region of poetry;&mdash;the faint beginnings of faiths and
      institutions, and their obscure lingering decay; the dust and withered
      remnants with which they are apt to be covered, only enhancing for the
      awakened perception the impressiveness either of a sublimely penetrating
      life, as in the twin green leaves that will become the sheltering tree, or
      of a pathetic inheritance in which all the grandeur and the glory have
      become a sorrowing memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This imaginative stirring, as he turned out of the Juden-gasse, and
      continued to saunter in the warm evening air, meaning to find his way to
      the synagogue, neutralized the repellent effect of certain ugly little
      incidents on his way. Turning into an old book-shop to ask the exact time
      of service at the synagogue, he was affectionately directed by a
      precocious Jewish youth, who entered cordially into his wanting, not the
      fine new building of the Reformed but the old Rabbinical school of the
      orthodox; and then cheated him like a pure Teuton, only with more amenity,
      in his charge for a book quite out of request as one &ldquo;nicht so
      leicht zu bekommen.&rdquo; Meanwhile at the opposite counter a deaf and
      grisly tradesman was casting a flinty look at certain cards, apparently
      combining advantages of business with religion, and shoutingly proposed to
      him in Jew-dialect by a dingy man in a tall coat hanging from neck to
      heel, a bag in hand, and a broad low hat surmounting his chosen nose&mdash;who
      had no sooner disappeared than another dingy man of the same pattern
      issued from the background glooms of the shop and also shouted in the same
      dialect. In fact, Deronda saw various queer-looking Israelites not
      altogether without guile, and just distinguishable from queer-looking
      Christians of the same mixed <i>morale</i>. In his anxiety about Mirah&rsquo;s
      relatives, he had lately been thinking of vulgar Jews with a sort of
      personal alarm. But a little comparison will often diminish our surprise
      and disgust at the aberrations of Jews and other dissidents whose lives do
      not offer a consistent or lovely pattern of their creed; and this evening
      Deronda, becoming more conscious that he was falling into unfairness and
      ridiculous exaggeration, began to use that corrective comparison: he paid
      his thaler too much, without prejudice to his interests in the Hebrew
      destiny, or his wish to find the <i>Rabbinische Schule</i>, which he
      arrived at by sunset, and entered with a good congregation of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He happened to take his seat in a line with an elderly man from whom he
      was distant enough to glance at him more than once as rather a noticeable
      figure&mdash;his ample white beard and felt hat framing a profile of that
      fine contour which may as easily be Italian as Hebrew. He returned Deronda&rsquo;s
      notice till at last their eyes met; an undesirable chance with unknown
      persons, and a reason to Deronda for not looking again; but he immediately
      found an open prayer-book pushed toward him and had to bow his thanks.
      However, the congregation had mustered, the reader had mounted to the <i>almemor</i>
      or platform, and the service began. Deronda, having looked enough at the
      German translation of the Hebrew in the book before him to know that he
      was chiefly hearing Psalms and Old Testament passages or phrases, gave
      himself up to that strongest effect of chanted liturgies which is
      independent of detailed verbal meaning&mdash;like the effect of an Allegri&rsquo;s
      <i>Miserere</i> or a Palestrina&rsquo;s <i>Magnificat</i>. The most
      powerful movement of feeling with a liturgy is the prayer which seeks for
      nothing special, but is a yearning to escape from the limitations of our
      own weakness and an invocation of all Good to enter and abide with us; or
      else a self-oblivious lifting up of Gladness, a <i>Gloria in excelsis</i>
      that such Good exists; both the yearning and the exaltation gathering
      their utmost force from the sense of communion in a form which has
      expressed them both, for long generations of struggling fellow-men. The
      Hebrew liturgy, like others, has its transitions of litany, lyric,
      proclamation, dry statement and blessing; but this evening, all were one
      for Deronda: the chant of the <i>Chazaris</i> or Reader&rsquo;s grand
      wide-ranging voice with its passage from monotony to sudden cries, the
      outburst of sweet boys&rsquo; voices from the little choir, the devotional
      swaying of men&rsquo;s bodies backward and forward, the very commonness of
      the building and shabbiness of the scene where a national faith, which had
      penetrated the thinking of half the world, and moulded the splendid forms
      of that world&rsquo;s religion, was finding a remote, obscure echo&mdash;all
      were blent for him as one expression of a binding history, tragic and yet
      glorious. He wondered at the strength of his own feeling; it seemed beyond
      the occasion&mdash;what one might imagine to be a divine influx in the
      darkness, before there was any vision to interpret. The whole scene was a
      coherent strain, its burden a passionate regret, which, if he had known
      the liturgy for the Day of Reconciliation, he might have clad in its
      autithetic burden; &ldquo;Happy the eye which saw all these things; but
      verily to hear only of them afflicts our soul. Happy the eye that saw our
      temple and the joy of our congregation; but verily to hear only of them
      afflicts our soul. Happy the eye that saw the fingers when tuning every
      kind of song; but verily to hear only of them afflicts our soul.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But with the cessation of the devotional sounds and the movement of many
      indifferent faces and vulgar figures before him there darted into his mind
      the frigid idea that he had probably been alone in his feeling, and
      perhaps the only person in the congregation for whom the service was more
      than a dull routine. There was just time for this chilling thought before
      he had bowed to his civil neighbor and was moving away with the rest&mdash;when
      he felt a hand on his arm, and turning with the rather unpleasant
      sensation which this abrupt sort of claim is apt to bring, he saw close to
      him the white-bearded face of that neighbor, who said to him in German,
      &ldquo;Excuse me, young gentleman&mdash;allow me&mdash;what is your
      parentage&mdash;your mother&rsquo;s family&mdash;her maiden name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda had a strongly resistant feeling: he was inclined to shake off
      hastily the touch on his arm; but he managed to slip it away and said
      coldly, &ldquo;I am an Englishman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The questioner looked at him dubiously still for an instant, then just
      lifted his hat and turned away; whether under a sense of having made a
      mistake or of having been repulsed, Deronda was uncertain. In his walk
      back to the hotel he tried to still any uneasiness on the subject by
      reflecting that he could not have acted differently. How could he say that
      he did not know the name of his mother&rsquo;s family to that total
      stranger?&mdash;who indeed had taken an unwarrantable liberty in the
      abruptness of his question, dictated probably by some fancy of likeness
      such as often occurs without real significance. The incident, he said to
      himself, was trivial; but whatever import it might have, his inward
      shrinking on the occasion was too strong for him to be sorry that he had
      cut it short. It was a reason, however, for his not mentioning the
      synagogue to the Mallingers&mdash;in addition to his usual inclination to
      reticence on anything that the baronet would have been likely to call
      Quixotic enthusiasm. Hardly any man could be more good-natured than Sir
      Hugo; indeed in his kindliness especially to women, he did actions which
      others would have called romantic; but he never took a romantic view of
      them, and in general smiled at the introduction of motives on a grand
      scale, or of reasons that lay very far off. This was the point of
      strongest difference between him and Deronda, who rarely ate at breakfast
      without some silent discursive flight after grounds for filling up his day
      according to the practice of his contemporaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      This halt at Frankfort was taken on their way home, and its impressions
      were kept the more actively vibrating in him by the duty of caring for
      Mirah&rsquo;s welfare. That question about his parentage, which if he had
      not both inwardly and outwardly shaken it off as trivial, would have
      seemed a threat rather than a promise of revelation, and reinforced his
      anxiety as to the effect of finding Mirah&rsquo;s relatives and his
      resolve to proceed with caution. If he made any unpleasant discovery, was
      he bound to a disclosure that might cast a new net of trouble around her?
      He had written to Mrs. Meyrick to announce his visit at four o&rsquo;clock,
      and he found Mirah seated at work with only Mrs. Meyrick and Mab, the open
      piano, and all the glorious company of engravings. The dainty neatness of
      her hair and dress, the glow of tranquil happiness in a face where a
      painter need have changed nothing if he had wanted to put it in front of
      the host singing &ldquo;peace on earth and good will to men,&rdquo; made a
      contrast to his first vision of her that was delightful to Deronda&rsquo;s
      eyes. Mirah herself was thinking of it, and immediately on their greeting
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how different I am from the miserable creature by the river!
      all because you found me and brought me to the very best.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my good chance to find you,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;Any
      other man would have been glad to do what I did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not the right way to be thinking about it,&rdquo; said
      Mirah, shaking her head with decisive gravity, &ldquo;I think of what
      really was. It was you, and not another, who found me and were good to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with Mirah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick. &ldquo;Saint Anybody
      is a bad saint to pray to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, Anybody could not have brought me to you,&rdquo; said
      Mirah, smiling at Mrs. Meyrick. &ldquo;And I would rather be with you than
      with any one else in the world except my mother. I wonder if ever a poor
      little bird, that was lost and could not fly, was taken and put into a
      warm nest where was a mother and sisters who took to it so that everything
      came naturally, as if it had been always there. I hardly thought before
      that the world could ever be as happy and without fear as it is to me now.&rdquo;
      She looked meditative a moment, and then said, &ldquo;sometimes I am a <i>little</i>
      afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you are afraid of?&rdquo; said Deronda with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That when I am turning at the corner of a street I may meet my
      father. It seems dreadful that I should be afraid of meeting him. That is
      my only sorrow,&rdquo; said Mirah, plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is surely not very probable,&rdquo; said Deronda, wishing that
      it were less so; then, not to let the opportunity escape&mdash;&ldquo;Would
      it be a great grief to you now if you were never to meet your mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer immediately, but meditated again, with her eyes fixed
      on the opposite wall. Then she turned them on Deronda and said firmly, as
      if she had arrived at the exact truth, &ldquo;I want her to know that I
      have always loved her, and if she is alive I want to comfort her. She may
      be dead. If she were I should long to know where she was buried; and to
      know whether my brother lives, to say Kaddish in memory of her. But I will
      try not to grieve. I have thought much for so many years of her being
      dead. And I shall have her with me in my mind, as I have always had. We
      can never be really parted. I think I have never sinned against her. I
      have always tried not to do what would hurt her. Only, she might be sorry
      that I was not a good Jewess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way are you not a good Jewess?&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ignorant, and we never observed the laws, but lived among
      Christians just as they did. But I have heard my father laugh at the
      strictness of the Jews about their food and all customs, and their not
      liking Christians. I think my mother was strict; but she could never want
      me not to like those who are better to me than any of my own people I have
      ever known. I think I could obey in other things that she wished but not
      in that. It is so much easier to me to share in love than in hatred. I
      remember a play I read in German&mdash;since I have been here it has come
      into my mind&mdash;where the heroine says something like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Antigone</i>,&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you know it. But I do not believe that my mother would wish me
      not to love my best friends. She would be grateful to them.&rdquo; Here
      Mirah had turned to Mrs. Meyrick, and with a sudden lighting up of her
      whole countenance, she said, &ldquo;Oh, if we ever do meet and know each
      other as we are now, so that I could tell what would comfort her&mdash;I
      should be so full of blessedness my soul would know no want but to love
      her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, child!&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick, the words escaping
      involuntarily from her motherly heart. But to relieve the strain of
      feeling she looked at Deronda and said, &ldquo;It is curious that Mirah,
      who remembers her mother so well it is as if she saw her, cannot recall
      her brother the least bit&mdash;except the feeling of having been carried
      by him when she was tired, and of his being near her when she was in her
      mother&rsquo;s lap. It must be that he was rarely at home. He was already
      grown up. It is a pity her brother should be quite a stranger to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is good; I feel sure Ezra is good,&rdquo; said Mirah, eagerly.
      &ldquo;He loved my mother&mdash;he would take care of her. I remember more
      of him than that. I remember my mother&rsquo;s voice once calling, &lsquo;Ezra!&rsquo;
      and then his answering from a distance &lsquo;Mother!&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Mirah
      had changed her voice a little in each of these words and had given them a
      loving intonation&mdash;&ldquo;and then he came close to us. I feel sure
      he is good. I have always taken comfort from that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to answer this either with agreement or doubt. Mrs.
      Meyrick and Deronda exchanged a quick glance: about this brother she felt
      as painfully dubious as he did. But Mirah went on, absorbed in her
      memories,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not wonderful how I remember the voices better than anything
      else? I think they must go deeper into us than other things. I have often
      fancied heaven might be made of voices.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like your singing&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said Mab, who had hitherto kept
      a modest silence, and now spoke bashfully, as was her wont in the presence
      of Prince Camaralzaman&mdash;&ldquo;Ma, do ask Mirah to sing. Mr. Deronda
      has not heard her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be disagreeable to you to sing now?&rdquo; said Deronda,
      with a more deferential gentleness than he had ever been conscious of
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I shall like it,&rdquo; said Mirah. &ldquo;My voice has come
      back a little with rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps her ease of manner was due to something more than the simplicity
      of her nature. The circumstances of her life made her think of everything
      she did as work demanded from her, in which affectation had nothing to do;
      and she had begun her work before self-consciousness was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      She immediately rose and went to the piano&mdash;a somewhat worn
      instrument that seemed to get the better of its infirmities under the firm
      touch of her small fingers as she preluded. Deronda placed himself where
      he could see her while she sang; and she took everything as quietly as if
      she had been a child going to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine her&mdash;it is always good to imagine a human creature in whom
      bodily loveliness seems as properly one with the entire being as the
      bodily loveliness of those wondrous transparent orbs of life that we find
      in the sea&mdash;imagine her with her dark hair brushed from her temples,
      but yet showing certain tiny rings there which had cunningly found their
      own way back, the mass of it hanging behind just to the nape of the little
      neck in curly fibres, such as renew themselves at their own will after
      being bathed into straightness like that of water-grasses. Then see the
      perfect cameo her profile makes, cut in a duskish shell, where by some
      happy fortune there pierced a gem-like darkness for the eye and eyebrow;
      the delicate nostrils defined enough to be ready for sensitive movements,
      the finished ear, the firm curves of the chin and neck, entering into the
      expression of a refinement which was not feebleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sang Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Per pietà non dirmi addio&rdquo; with a
      subdued but searching pathos which had that essential of perfect singing,
      the making one oblivious of art or manner, and only possessing one with
      the song. It was the sort of voice that gives the impression of being
      meant like a bird&rsquo;s wooing for an audience near and beloved. Deronda
      began by looking at her, but felt himself presently covering his eyes with
      his hand, wanting to seclude the melody in darkness; then he refrained
      from what might seem oddity, and was ready to meet the look of mute appeal
      which she turned toward him at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I never enjoyed a song more than that,&rdquo; he said,
      gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like my singing? I am so glad,&rdquo; she said, with a smile of
      delight. &ldquo;It has been a great pain to me, because it failed in what
      it was wanted for. But now we think I can use it to get my bread. I have
      really been taught well. And now I have two pupils, that Miss Meyrick
      found for me. They pay me nearly two crowns for their two lessons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know some ladies who would find you many pupils after
      Christmas,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;You would not mind singing before
      any one who wished to hear you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, I want to do something to get money. I could teach reading
      and speaking, Mrs. Meyrick thinks. But if no one would learn of me, that
      is difficult.&rdquo; Mirah smiled with a touch of merriment he had not
      seen in her before. &ldquo;I dare say I should find her poor&mdash;I mean
      my mother. I should want to get money for her. And I can not always live
      on charity; though&rdquo;&mdash;here she turned so as to take all three of
      her companions in one glance&mdash;&ldquo;it is the sweetest charity in
      all the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you can get rich,&rdquo; said Deronda, smiling.
      &ldquo;Great ladies will perhaps like you to teach their daughters. We
      shall see. But now do sing again to us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on willingly, singing with ready memory various things by
      Gordigiani and Schubert; then, when she had left the piano, Mab said,
      entreatingly, &ldquo;Oh, Mirah, if you would not mind singing the little
      hymn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too childish,&rdquo; said Mirah. &ldquo;It is like lisping.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the hymn?&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Hebrew hymn she remembers her mother singing over her
      when she lay in her cot,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like very much to hear it,&rdquo; said Deronda, &ldquo;if
      you think I am worthy to hear what is so sacred.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will sing it if you like,&rdquo; said Mirah, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
      sing real words&mdash;only here and there a syllable like hers&mdash;the
      rest is lisping. Do you know Hebrew? because if you do, my singing will
      seem childish nonsense.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda shook his head. &ldquo;It will be quite good Hebrew to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah crossed her little feet and hands in her easiest attitude, and then
      lifted up her head at an angle which seemed to be directed to some
      invisible face bent over her, while she sang a little hymn of quaint
      melancholy intervals, with syllables that really seemed childish lisping
      to her audience; the voice in which she gave it forth had gathered even a
      sweeter, more cooing tenderness than was heard in her other songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were ever to know the real words, I should still go on in my
      old way with them,&rdquo; said Mirah, when she had repeated the hymn
      several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;The lisped syllables are very
      full of meaning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick. &ldquo;A mother hears
      something of a lisp in her children&rsquo;s talk to the very last. Their
      words are not just what everybody else says, though they may be spelled
      the same. If I were to live till my Hans got old, I should still see the
      boy in him. A mother&rsquo;s love, I often say, is like a tree that has
      got all the wood in it, from the very first it made.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not that the way with friendship, too?&rdquo; said Deronda,
      smiling. &ldquo;We must not let the mothers be too arrogant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little woman shook her head over her darning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easier to find an old mother than an old friend. Friendships
      begin with liking or gratitude&mdash;roots that can be pulled up. Mother&rsquo;s
      love begins deeper down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like what you were saying about the influence of voices,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, looking at Mirah. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think your hymn would
      have had more expression for me if I had known the words. I went to the
      synagogue at Frankfort before I came home, and the service impressed me
      just as much as if I had followed the words&mdash;perhaps more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, was it great to you? Did it go to your heart?&rdquo; said
      Mirah, eagerly. &ldquo;I thought none but our people would feel that. I
      thought it was all shut away like a river in a deep valley, where only
      heaven saw&mdash;I mean&mdash;-&rdquo; she hesitated, feeling that she
      could not disentangle her thought from its imagery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;But there is not really
      such a separation&mdash;deeper down, as Mrs. Meyrick says. Our religion is
      chiefly a Hebrew religion; and since Jews are men, their religious
      feelings must have much in common with those of other men&mdash;just as
      their poetry, though in one sense peculiar, has a great deal in common
      with the poetry of other nations. Still it is to be expected that a Jew
      would feel the forms of his people&rsquo;s religion more than one of
      another race&mdash;and yet&rdquo;&mdash;here Deronda hesitated in his turn&mdash;&ldquo;that
      is perhaps not always so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah no,&rdquo; said Mirah, sadly. &ldquo;I have seen that. I have
      seen them mock. Is it not like mocking your parents?&mdash;like rejoicing
      in your parents&rsquo; shame?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some minds naturally rebel against whatever they were brought up
      in, and like the opposite; they see the faults in what is nearest to them,&rdquo;
      said Deronda apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not like that,&rdquo; said Mirah, looking at him with
      unconscious fixedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I think not,&rdquo; said Deronda; &ldquo;but you know I was not
      brought up as a Jew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I am always forgetting,&rdquo; said Mirah, with a look of
      disappointed recollection, and slightly blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda also felt rather embarrassed, and there was an awkward pause,
      which he put an end to by saying playfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whichever way we take it, we have to tolerate each other; for if we
      all went in opposition to our teaching, we must end in difference, just
      the same.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. We should go on forever in zig-zags,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Meyrick. &ldquo;I think it is very weak-minded to make your creed up by
      the rule of the contrary. Still one may honor one&rsquo;s parents, without
      following their notions exactly, any more than the exact cut of their
      clothing. My father was a Scotch Calvinist and my mother was a French
      Calvinist; I am neither quite Scotch, nor quite French, nor two Calvinists
      rolled into one, yet I honor my parents&rsquo; memory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I could not make myself not a Jewess,&rdquo; said Mirah,
      insistently, &ldquo;even if I changed my belief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear. But if Jews and Jewesses went on changing their
      religion, and making no difference between themselves and Christians,
      there would come a time when there would be no Jews to be seen,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Meyrick, taking that consummation very cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please not to say that,&rdquo; said Mirah, the tears gathering.
      &ldquo;It is the first unkind thing you ever said. I will not begin that.
      I will never separate myself from my mother&rsquo;s people. I was forced
      to fly from my father; but if he came back in age and weakness and want,
      and needed me, should I say, &lsquo;This is not my father&rsquo;? If he
      had shame, I must share it. It was he who was given to me for my father,
      and not another. And so it is with my people. I will always be a Jewess. I
      will love Christians when they are good, like you. But I will always cling
      to my people. I will always worship with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mirah had gone on speaking she had become possessed with a sorrowful
      passion&mdash;fervent, not violent. Holding her little hands tightly
      clasped and looking at Mrs. Meyrick with beseeching, she seemed to Deronda
      a personification of that spirit which impelled men after a long
      inheritance of professed Catholicism to leave wealth and high place and
      risk their lives in flight, that they might join their own people and say,
      &ldquo;I am a Jew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mirah, Mirah, my dear child, you mistake me!&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Meyrick, alarmed. &ldquo;God forbid I should want you to do anything
      against your conscience. I was only saying what might be if the world went
      on. But I had better have left the world alone, and not wanted to be
      over-wise. Forgive me, come! we will not try to take you from anybody you
      feel has more right to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would do anything else for you. I owe you my life,&rdquo; said
      Mirah, not yet quite calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush, now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick. &ldquo;I have been
      punished enough for wagging my tongue foolishly&mdash;making an almanac
      for the Millennium, as my husband used to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But everything in the world must come to an end some time. We must
      bear to think of that,&rdquo; said Mab, unable to hold her peace on this
      point. She had already suffered from a bondage of tongue which threatened
      to become severe if Mirah were to be too much indulged in this
      inconvenient susceptibility to innocent remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda smiled at the irregular, blonde face, brought into strange
      contrast by the side of Mirah&rsquo;s&mdash;smiled, Mab thought, rather
      sarcastically as he said, &ldquo;That prospect of everything coming to an
      end will not guide us far in practice. Mirah&rsquo;s feelings, she tells
      us, are concerned with what is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mab was confused and wished she had not spoken, since Mr. Deronda seemed
      to think that she had found fault with Mirah; but to have spoken once is a
      tyrannous reason for speaking again, and she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only meant that we must have courage to hear things, else there
      is hardly anything we can talk about.&rdquo; Mab felt herself unanswerable
      here, inclining to the opinion of Socrates: &ldquo;What motive has a man
      to live, if not for the pleasure of discourse?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda took his leave soon after, and when Mrs. Meyrick went outside with
      him to exchange a few words about Mirah, he said, &ldquo;Hans is to share
      my chambers when he comes at Christmas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have written to Rome about that?&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick, her
      face lighting up. &ldquo;How very good and thoughtful of you! You
      mentioned Mirah, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I referred to her. I concluded he knew everything from you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess my folly. I have not yet written a word about her. I
      have always been meaning to do it, and yet have ended my letter without
      saying a word. And I told the girls to leave it to me. However!&mdash;Thank
      you a thousand times.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda divined something of what was in the mother&rsquo;s mind, and his
      divination reinforced a certain anxiety already present in him. His inward
      colloquy was not soothing. He said to himself that no man could see this
      exquisite creature without feeling it possible to fall in love with her;
      but all the fervor of his nature was engaged on the side of precaution.
      There are personages who feel themselves tragic because they march into a
      palpable morass, dragging another with them, and then cry out against all
      the gods. Deronda&rsquo;s mind was strongly set against imitating them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my hands on the reins now,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and I
      will not drop them. I shall go there as little as possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the reasons acting themselves out before him. How could he be Mirah&rsquo;s
      guardian and claim to unite with Mrs. Meyrick, to whose charge he had
      committed her, if he showed himself as a lover&mdash;whom she did not love&mdash;whom
      she would not marry? And if he encouraged any germ of lover&rsquo;s
      feeling in himself it would lead up to that issue. Mirah&rsquo;s was not a
      nature that would bear dividing against itself; and even if love won her
      consent to marry a man who was not of her race and religion, she would
      never be happy in acting against that strong native bias which would still
      reign in her conscience as remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda saw these consequences as we see any danger of marring our own
      work well begun. It was a delight to have rescued this child acquainted
      with sorrow, and to think of having placed her little feet in protected
      paths. The creature we help to save, though only a half-reared linnet,
      bruised and lost by the wayside&mdash;how we watch and fence it, and dote
      on its signs of recovery! Our pride becomes loving, our self is a not-self
      for whose sake we become virtuous, when we set to some hidden work of
      reclaiming a life from misery and look for our triumph in the secret joy&mdash;&ldquo;This
      one is the better for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would as soon hold out my finger to be bitten off as set about
      spoiling her peace,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;It was one of the rarest
      bits of fortune that I should have had friends like the Meyricks to place
      her with&mdash;generous, delicate friends without any loftiness in their
      ways, so that her dependence on them is not only safety but happiness.
      There could be no refuge to replace that, if it were broken up. But what
      is the use of my taking the vows and settling everything as it should be,
      if that marplot Hans comes and upsets it all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Few things were more likely. Hans was made for mishaps: his very limbs
      seemed more breakable than other people&rsquo;s&mdash;his eyes more of a
      resort for uninvited flies and other irritating guests. But it was
      impossible to forbid Hans&rsquo;s coming to London. He was intending to
      get a studio there and make it his chief home; and to propose that he
      should defer coming on some ostensible ground, concealing the real motive
      of winning time for Mirah&rsquo;s position to become more confirmed and
      independent, was impracticable. Having no other resource Deronda tried to
      believe that both he and Mrs. Meyrick were foolishly troubling themselves
      about one of those endless things called probabilities, which never occur;
      but he did not quite succeed in his trying; on the contrary, he found
      himself going inwardly through a scene where on the first discovery of
      Hans&rsquo;s inclination he gave him a very energetic warning&mdash;suddenly
      checked, however, by the suspicion of personal feeling that his warmth
      might be creating in Hans. He could come to no result, but that the
      position was peculiar, and that he could make no further provision against
      dangers until they came nearer. To save an unhappy Jewess from drowning
      herself, would not have seemed a startling variation among police reports;
      but to discover in her so rare a creature as Mirah, was an exceptional
      event which might well bring exceptional consequences. Deronda would not
      let himself for a moment dwell on any supposition that the consequences
      might enter deeply into his own life. The image of Mirah had never yet had
      that penetrating radiation which would have been given to it by the idea
      of her loving him. When this sort of effluence is absent from the fancy
      (whether from the fact or not) a man may go far in devotedness without
      perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the search for Mirah&rsquo;s mother and brother, Deronda took what
      she had said to-day as a warrant for deferring any immediate measures. His
      conscience was not quite easy in this desire for delay, any more than it
      was quite easy in his not attempting to learn the truth about his own
      mother: in both cases he felt that there might be an unfulfilled duty to a
      parent, but in both cases there was an overpowering repugnance to the
      possible truth, which threw a turning weight into the scale of argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, I will look about,&rdquo; was his final determination.
      &ldquo;I may find some special Jewish machinery. I will wait till after
      Christmas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What should we all do without the calendar, when we want to put off a
      disagreeable duty? The admirable arrangements of the solar system, by
      which our time is measured, always supply us with a term before which it
      is hardly worth while to set about anything we are disinclined to.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;No man,&rdquo; says a Rabbi, by way of indisputable instance, &ldquo;may turn the
    bones of his father and mother into spoons&rdquo;&mdash;sure that his hearers
    felt the checks against that form of economy. The market for spoons
    has never expanded enough for any one to say, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; and to argue
    that human progress lies in such an application of material. The only
    check to be alleged is a sentiment, which will coerce none who do not
    hold that sentiments are the better part of the world&rsquo;s wealth.
</pre>
    <p>
      Deronda meanwhile took to a less fashionable form of exercise than riding
      in Rotten Row. He went often rambling in those parts of London which are
      most inhabited by common Jews. He walked to the synagogues at times of
      service, he looked into shops, he observed faces:&mdash;a process not very
      promising of particular discovery. Why did he not address himself to an
      influential Rabbi or other member of a Jewish community, to consult on the
      chances of finding a mother named Cohen, with a son named Ezra, and a lost
      daughter named Mirah? He thought of doing so&mdash;after Christmas. The
      fact was, notwithstanding all his sense of poetry in common things,
      Deronda, where a keen personal interest was aroused, could not, more than
      the rest of us, continuously escape suffering from the pressure of that
      hard unaccommodating Actual, which has never consulted our taste and is
      entirely unselect. Enthusiasm, we know, dwells at ease among ideas,
      tolerates garlic breathed in the middle ages, and sees no shabbiness in
      the official trappings of classic processions: it gets squeamish when
      ideals press upon it as something warmly incarnate, and can hardly face
      them without fainting. Lying dreamily in a boat, imagining one&rsquo;s
      self in quest of a beautiful maiden&rsquo;s relatives in Cordova elbowed
      by Jews in the time of Ibn-Gebirol, all the physical incidents can be
      borne without shock. Or if the scenery of St. Mary Axe and Whitechapel
      were imaginatively transported to the borders of the Rhine at the end of
      the eleventh century, when in the ears listening for the signals of the
      Messiah, the Hep! Hep! Hep! of the Crusaders came like the bay of
      blood-hounds; and in the presence of those devilish missionaries with
      sword and firebrand the crouching figure of the reviled Jew turned round
      erect, heroic, flashing with sublime constancy in the face of torture and
      death&mdash;what would the dingy shops and unbeautiful faces signify to
      the thrill of contemplative emotion? But the fervor of sympathy with which
      we contemplate a grandiose martyrdom is feeble compared with the
      enthusiasm that keeps unslacked where there is no danger, no challenge&mdash;nothing
      but impartial midday falling on commonplace, perhaps half-repulsive,
      objects which are really the beloved ideas made flesh. Here undoubtedly
      lies the chief poetic energy: in the force of imagination that pierces or
      exalts the solid fact, instead of floating among cloud-pictures. To glory
      in a prophetic vision of knowledge covering the earth, is an easier
      exercise of believing imagination than to see its beginning in newspaper
      placards, staring at you from the bridge beyond the corn-fields; and it
      might well happen to most of us dainty people that we were in the thick of
      the battle of Armageddon without being aware of anything more than the
      annoyance of a little explosive smoke and struggling on the ground
      immediately about us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It lay in Deronda&rsquo;s nature usually to contemn the feeble, fastidious
      sympathy which shrinks from the broad life of mankind; but now, with Mirah
      before him as a living reality, whose experience he had to care for, he
      saw every common Jew and Jewess in the light of a comparison with her, and
      had a presentiment of the collision between her idea of the unknown mother
      and brother and the discovered fact&mdash;a presentiment all the keener in
      him because of a suppressed consciousness that a not unlike possibility of
      collision might lie hidden in his own lot. Not that he would have looked
      with more complacency of expectation at wealthy Jews, outdoing the lords
      of the Philistines in their sports; but since there was no likelihood of
      Mirah&rsquo;s friends being found among that class, their habits did not
      immediately affect him. In this mood he rambled, without expectation of a
      more pregnant result than a little preparation of his own mind, perhaps
      for future theorizing as well as practice&mdash;very much as if, Mirah
      being related to Welsh miners, he had gone to look more closely at the
      ways of those people, not without wishing at the same time to get a little
      light of detail on the history of Strikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He really did not long to find anybody in particular; and when, as his
      habit was, he looked at the name over a shop door, he was well content
      that it was not Ezra Cohen. I confess, he particularly desired that Ezra
      Cohen should not keep a shop. Wishes are held to be ominous; according to
      which belief the order of the world is so arranged that if you have an
      impious objection to a squint, your offspring is the more likely to be
      born with one; also, that if you happened to desire a squint you would not
      get it. This desponding view of probability the hopeful entirely reject,
      taking their wishes as good and sufficient security for all kinds of
      fulfilment. Who is absolutely neutral? Deronda happening one morning to
      turn into a little side street out of the noise and obstructions of
      Holborn, felt the scale dip on the desponding side.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was rather tired of the streets and had paused to hail a hansom cab
      which he saw coming, when his attention was caught by some fine old clasps
      in chased silver displayed in the window at his right hand. His first
      thought was that Lady Mallinger, who had a strictly Protestant taste for
      such Catholic spoils, might like to have these missal-clasps turned into a
      bracelet: then his eyes traveled over the other contents of the window,
      and he saw that the shop was that kind of pawnbroker&rsquo;s where the
      lead is given to jewelry, lace and all equivocal objects introduced as <i>bric-à-brac</i>.
      A placard in one corner announced&mdash;<i>Watches and Jewelry exchanged
      and repaired</i>. But his survey had been noticed from within, and a
      figure appeared at the door, looking round at him and saying in a tone of
      cordial encouragement, &ldquo;Good day, sir.&rdquo; The instant was enough
      for Deronda to see the face, unmistakably Jewish, belonged to a young man
      about thirty, and wincing from the shopkeeper&rsquo;s persuasiveness that
      would probably follow, he had no sooner returned the &ldquo;good day,&rdquo;
      than he passed to the other side of the street and beckoned to the cabman
      to draw up there. From that station he saw the name over the shop window&mdash;<i>Ezra
      Cohen</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There might be a hundred Ezra Cohens lettered above shop windows, but
      Deronda had not seen them. Probably the young man interested in a possible
      customer was Ezra himself; and he was about the age to be expected in
      Mirah&rsquo;s brother, who was grown up while she was still a little
      child. But Deronda&rsquo;s first endeavor as he drove homeward was to
      convince himself that there was not the slightest warrantable presumption
      of this Ezra being Mirah&rsquo;s brother; and next, that even if, in spite
      of good reasoning, he turned out to be that brother, while on inquiry the
      mother was found to be dead, it was not his&mdash;Deronda&rsquo;s&mdash;duty
      to make known the discovery to Mirah. In inconvenient disturbance of this
      conclusion there came his lately-acquired knowledge that Mirah would have
      a religious desire to know of her mother&rsquo;s death, and also to learn
      whether her brother were living. How far was he justified in determining
      another life by his own notions? Was it not his secret complaint against
      the way in which others had ordered his own life, that he had not open
      daylight on all its relations, so that he had not, like other men, the
      full guidance of primary duties?
    </p>
    <p>
      The immediate relief from this inward debate was the reflection that he
      had not yet made any real discovery, and that by looking into the facts
      more closely he should be certified that there was no demand on him for
      any decision whatever. He intended to return to that shop as soon as he
      could conveniently, and buy the clasps for Lady Mallinger. But he was
      hindered for several days by Sir Hugo, who, about to make an after-dinner
      speech on a burning topic, wanted Deronda to forage for him on the legal
      part of the question, besides wasting time every day on argument which
      always ended in a drawn battle. As on many other questions, they held
      different sides, but Sir Hugo did not mind this, and when Deronda put his
      point well, said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it, Dan! why don&rsquo;t you make an opportunity of saying
      these things in public? You&rsquo;re wrong, you know. You won&rsquo;t
      succeed. You&rsquo;ve got the massive sentiment&mdash;the heavy artillery
      of the country against you. But it&rsquo;s all the better ground for a
      young man to display himself on. When I was your age, I should have taken
      it. And it would be quite as well for you to be in opposition to me here
      and there. It would throw you more into relief. If you would seize an
      occasion of this sort to make an impression, you might be in Parliament in
      no time. And you know that would gratify me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry not to do what would gratify you, sir,&rdquo; said
      Deronda. &ldquo;But I cannot persuade myself to look at politics as a
      profession.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? if a man is not born into public life by his position in
      the country, there&rsquo;s no way for him but to embrace it by his own
      efforts. The business of the country must be done&mdash;her Majesty&rsquo;s
      Government carried on, as the old Duke said. And it never could be, my
      boy, if everybody looked at politics as if they were prophecy, and
      demanded an inspired vocation. If you are to get into Parliament, it won&rsquo;t
      do to sit still and wait for a call either from heaven or constituents.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make a living out of opinions,&rdquo; said
      Deronda; &ldquo;especially out of borrowed opinions. Not that I mean to
      blame other men. I dare say many better fellows than I don&rsquo;t mind
      getting on to a platform to praise themselves, and giving their word of
      honor for a party.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Dan,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, &ldquo;a man
      who sets his face against every sort of humbug is simply a three-cornered,
      impracticable fellow. There&rsquo;s a bad style of humbug, but there is
      also a good style&mdash;one that oils the wheels and makes progress
      possible. If you are to rule men, you must rule them through their own
      ideas; and I agree with the Archbishop at Naples who had a St. Januarius
      procession against the plague. It&rsquo;s no use having an Order in
      Council against popular shallowness. There is no action possible without a
      little acting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One may be obliged to give way to an occasional necessity,&rdquo;
      said Deronda. &ldquo;But it is one thing to say, &lsquo;In this particular
      case I am forced to put on this foolscap and grin,&rsquo; and another to
      buy a pocket foolscap and practice myself in grinning. I can&rsquo;t see
      any real public expediency that does not keep an ideal before it which
      makes a limit of deviation from the direct path. But if I were to set up
      for a public man I might mistake my success for public expediency.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after this dialogue, which was rather jarring to him, that Deronda
      set out on his meditated second visit to Ezra Cohen&rsquo;s. He entered
      the street at the end opposite to the Holborn entrance, and an inward
      reluctance slackened his pace while his thoughts were transferring what he
      had just been saying about public expediency to the entirely private
      difficulty which brought him back again into this unattractive
      thoroughfare. It might soon become an immediate practical question with
      him how far he could call it a wise expediency to conceal the fact of
      close kindred. Such questions turning up constantly in life are often
      decided in a rough-and-ready way; and to many it will appear an
      over-refinement in Deronda that he should make any great point of a matter
      confined to his own knowledge. But we have seen the reasons why he had
      come to regard concealment as a bane of life, and the necessity of
      concealment as a mark by which lines of action were to be avoided. The
      prospect of being urged against the confirmed habit of his mind was
      naturally grating. He even paused here and there before the most plausible
      shop-windows for a gentleman to look into, half inclined to decide that he
      would not increase his knowledge about that modern Ezra, who was certainly
      not a leader among his people&mdash;a hesitation which proved how, in a
      man much given to reasoning, a bare possibility may weigh more than the
      best-clad likelihood; for Deronda&rsquo;s reasoning had decided that all
      likelihood was against this man&rsquo;s being Mirah&rsquo;s brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the shop-windows he paused before was that of a second-hand
      book-shop, where, on a narrow table outside, the literature of the ages
      was represented in judicious mixture, from the immortal verse of Homer to
      the mortal prose of the railway novel. That the mixture was judicious was
      apparent from Deronda&rsquo;s finding in it something that he wanted&mdash;namely,
      that wonderful bit of autobiography, the life of the Polish Jew, Salomon
      Maimon; which, as he could easily slip it into his pocket, he took from
      its place, and entered the shop to pay for, expecting to see behind the
      counter a grimy personage showing that <i>nonchalance</i> about sales
      which seems to belong universally to the second-hand book-business. In
      most other trades you find generous men who are anxious to sell you their
      wares for your own welfare; but even a Jew will not urge Simson&rsquo;s
      Euclid on you with an affectionate assurance that you will have pleasure
      in reading it, and that he wishes he had twenty more of the article, so
      much is it in request. One is led to fear that a secondhand bookseller may
      belong to that unhappy class of men who have no belief in the good of what
      they get their living by, yet keep conscience enough to be morose rather
      than unctuous in their vocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But instead of the ordinary tradesman, he saw, on the dark background of
      books in the long narrow shop, a figure that was somewhat startling in its
      unusualness. A man in threadbare clothing, whose age was difficult to
      guess&mdash;from the dead yellowish flatness of the flesh, something like
      an old ivory carving&mdash;was seated on a stool against some bookshelves
      that projected beyond the short counter, doing nothing more remarkable
      than reading yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Times</i>; but when he let the paper
      rest on his lap and looked at the incoming customer, the thought glanced
      through Deronda that precisely such a physiognomy as that might possibly
      have been seen in a prophet of the Exile, or in some New Hebrew poet of
      the mediæval time. It was a fine typical Jewish face, wrought into
      intensity of expression apparently by a strenuous eager experience in
      which all the satisfaction had been indirect and far off, and perhaps by
      some bodily suffering also, which involved that absence of ease in the
      present. The features were clear-cut, not large; the brow not high but
      broad, and fully defined by the crisp black hair. It might never have been
      a particularly handsome face, but it must always have been forcible; and
      now with its dark, far-off gaze, and yellow pallor in relief on the gloom
      of the backward shop, one might have imagined one&rsquo;s self coming upon
      it in some past prison of the Inquisition, which a mob had suddenly burst
      upon; while the look fixed on an incidental customer seemed eager and
      questioning enough to have been turned on one who might have been a
      messenger either of delivery or of death. The figure was probably familiar
      and unexciting enough to the inhabitants of this street; but to Deronda&rsquo;s
      mind it brought so strange a blending of the unwonted with the common,
      that there was a perceptible interval of mutual observation before he
      asked his question; &ldquo;What is the price of this book?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After taking the book and examining the fly-leaves without rising, the
      supposed bookseller said, &ldquo;There is no mark, and Mr. Ram is not in
      now. I am keeping the shop while he is gone to dinner. What are you
      disposed to give for it?&rdquo; He held the book close on his lap with his
      hand on it and looked examiningly at Deronda, over whom there came the
      disagreeable idea, that possibly this striking personage wanted to see how
      much could be got out of a customer&rsquo;s ignorance of prices. But
      without further reflection he said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know how much
      it is worth?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not its market-price. May I ask have you read it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I have read an account of it, which makes me want to buy it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a man of learning&mdash;you are interested in Jewish
      history?&rdquo; This was said in a deepened tone of eager inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certainly interested in Jewish history,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      quietly, curiosity overcoming his dislike to the sort of inspection as
      well as questioning he was under.
    </p>
    <p>
      But immediately the strange Jew rose from his sitting posture, and Deronda
      felt a thin hand pressing his arm tightly, while a hoarse, excited voice,
      not much above a loud whisper, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are perhaps of our race?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda colored deeply, not liking the grasp, and then answered with a
      slight shake of the head, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The grasp was relaxed, the
      hand withdrawn, the eagerness of the face collapsed into uninterested
      melancholy, as if some possessing spirit which had leaped into the eyes
      and gestures had sunk back again to the inmost recesses of the frame; and
      moving further off as he held out the little book, the stranger said in a
      tone of distant civility, &ldquo;I believe Mr. Ram will be satisfied with
      half-a-crown, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this change on Deronda&mdash;he afterward smiled when he
      recalled it&mdash;was oddly embarrassing and humiliating, as if some high
      dignitary had found him deficient and given him his <i>congé</i>. There
      was nothing further to be said, however: he paid his half-crown and
      carried off his <i>Salomon Maimon&rsquo;s Lebensgeschichte</i> with a mere
      &ldquo;good-morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt some vexation at the sudden arrest of the interview, and the
      apparent prohibition that he should know more of this man, who was
      certainly something out of the common way&mdash;as different probably as a
      Jew could well be from Ezra Cohen, through whose door Deronda was
      presently entering, and whose flourishing face glistening on the way to
      fatness was hanging over the counter in negotiation with some one on the
      other side of the partition, concerning two plated stoppers and three
      teaspoons, which lay spread before him. Seeing Deronda enter, he called
      out &ldquo;Mother! Mother!&rdquo; and then with a familiar nod and smile,
      said, &ldquo;Coming, sir&mdash;coming directly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda could not help looking toward the door from the back with some
      anxiety, which was not soothed when he saw a vigorous woman beyond fifty
      enter and approach to serve him. Not that there was anything very
      repulsive about her: the worst that could be said was that she had that
      look of having made her toilet with little water, and by twilight, which
      is common to unyouthful people of her class, and of having presumably
      slept in her large earrings, if not in her rings and necklace. In fact,
      what caused a sinking of heart in Deronda was her not being so coarse and
      ugly as to exclude the idea of her being Mirah&rsquo;s mother. Any one who
      has looked at a face to try and discern signs of known kinship in it will
      understand his process of conjecture&mdash;how he tried to think away the
      fat which had gradually disguised the outlines of youth, and to discern
      what one may call the elementary expressions of the face. He was sorry to
      see no absolute negative to his fears. Just as it was conceivable that
      this Ezra, brought up to trade, might resemble the scapegrace father in
      everything but his knowledge and talent, so it was not impossible that
      this mother might have had a lovely refined daughter whose type of feature
      and expression was like Mirah&rsquo;s. The eyebrows had a vexatious
      similarity of line; and who shall decide how far a face may be masked when
      the uncherishing years have thrust it far onward in the ever-new
      procession of youth and age? The good-humor of the glance remained and
      shone out in a motherly way at Deronda, as she said, in a mild guttural
      tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I serve you, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to look at the silver clasps in the window,&rdquo;
      said Deronda; &ldquo;the larger ones, please, in the corner there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not quite easy to get at from the mother&rsquo;s station, and
      the son seeing this called out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll reach &lsquo;em, mother;
      I&rsquo;ll reach &lsquo;em,&rdquo; running forward with alacrity, and then
      handing the clasps to Deronda with the smiling remark,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s too proud: she wants to do everything herself. That&rsquo;s
      why I called her to wait on you, sir. When there&rsquo;s a particular
      gentleman customer, sir, I daren&rsquo;t do any other than call her. But I
      can&rsquo;t let her do herself mischief with stretching.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Cohen made way again for his parent, who gave a little guttural,
      amiable laugh while she looked at Deronda, as much as to say, &ldquo;This
      boy will be at his jokes, but you see he&rsquo;s the best son in the
      world,&rdquo; and evidently the son enjoyed pleasing her, though he also
      wished to convey an apology to his distinguished customer for not giving
      him the advantage of his own exclusive attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda began to examine the clasps as if he had many points to observe
      before he could come to a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are only three guineas, sir,&rdquo; said the mother,
      encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First-rate workmanship, sir&mdash;worth twice the money; only I get
      &lsquo;em a bargain from Cologne,&rdquo; said the son, parenthetically,
      from a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile two new customers entered, and the repeated call, &ldquo;Addy!&rdquo;
      brought from the back of the shop a group that Deronda turned frankly to
      stare at, feeling sure that the stare would be held complimentary. The
      group consisted of a black-eyed young woman who carried a black-eyed
      little one, its head already covered with black curls, and deposited it on
      the counter, from which station it looked round with even more than the
      usual intelligence of babies: also a robust boy of six and a younger girl,
      both with black eyes and black-ringed hair&mdash;looking more Semitic than
      their parents, as the puppy lions show the spots of far-off progenitors.
      The young woman answering to &ldquo;Addy&rdquo;&mdash;a sort of paroquet
      in a bright blue dress, with coral necklace and earrings, her hair set up
      in a huge bush&mdash;looked as complacently lively and unrefined as her
      husband; and by a certain difference from the mother deepened in Deronda
      the unwelcome impression that the latter was not so utterly common a
      Jewess as to exclude her being the mother of Mirah. While that thought was
      glancing through his mind, the boy had run forward into the shop with an
      energetic stamp, and setting himself about four feet from Deronda, with
      his hands in the pockets of his miniature knickerbockers, looked at him
      with a precocious air of survey. Perhaps it was chiefly with a diplomatic
      design to linger and ingratiate himself that Deronda patted the boy&rsquo;s
      head, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name, sirrah?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacob Alexander Cohen,&rdquo; said the small man, with much ease
      and distinctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not named after your father, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, after my grandfather; he sells knives and razors and scissors&mdash;my
      grandfather does,&rdquo; said Jacob, wishing to impress the stranger with
      that high connection. &ldquo;He gave me this knife.&rdquo; Here a
      pocket-knife was drawn forth, and the small fingers, both naturally and
      artificially dark, opened two blades and a cork-screw with much quickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not that a dangerous plaything?&rdquo; said Deronda, turning to
      the grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He</i>&rsquo;ll never hurt himself, bless you!&rdquo; said she,
      contemplating her grandson with placid rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have <i>you</i> got a knife?&rdquo; says Jacob, coming closer. His
      small voice was hoarse in its glibness, as if it belonged to an aged
      commercial soul, fatigued with bargaining through many generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Do you want to see it?&rdquo; said Deronda, taking a small
      penknife from his waistcoat-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob seized it immediately and retreated a little, holding the two knives
      in his palms and bending over them in meditative comparison. By this time
      the other clients were gone, and the whole family had gathered to the
      spot, centering their attention on the marvelous Jacob: the father,
      mother, and grandmother behind the counter, with baby held staggering
      thereon, and the little girl in front leaning at her brother&rsquo;s elbow
      to assist him in looking at the knives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s the best,&rdquo; said Jacob, at last, returning
      Deronda&rsquo;s knife as if he had been entertaining the idea of exchange
      and had rejected it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father and mother laughed aloud with delight. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find
      Jacob choosing the worst,&rdquo; said Mr. Cohen, winking, with much
      confidence in the customer&rsquo;s admiration. Deronda, looking at the
      grandmother, who had only an inward silent laugh, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are these the only grandchildren you have?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All. This is my only son,&rdquo; she answered in a communicative
      tone, Deronda&rsquo;s glance and manner as usual conveying the impression
      of sympathetic interest&mdash;which on this occasion answered his purpose
      well. It seemed to come naturally enough that he should say,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have no daughter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an instantaneous change in the mother&rsquo;s face. Her lips
      closed more firmly, she looked down, swept her hands outward on the
      counter, and finally turned her back on Deronda to examine some Indian
      handkerchiefs that hung in pawn behind her. Her son gave a significant
      glance, set up his shoulders an instant and just put his fingers to his
      lips,&mdash;then said quickly, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re a first-rate
      gentleman in the city, sir, if I may be allowed to guess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Deronda, with a preoccupied air, &ldquo;I have
      nothing to do with the city.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bad job. I thought you might be the young principal
      of a first-rate firm,&rdquo; said Mr. Cohen, wishing to make amends for
      the check on his customer&rsquo;s natural desire to know more of him and
      his. &ldquo;But you understand silver-work, I see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little,&rdquo; said Deronda, taking up the clasps a moment and
      laying them down again. That unwelcome bit of circumstantial evidence had
      made his mind busy with a plan which was certainly more like acting than
      anything he had been aware of in his own conduct before. But the bare
      possibility that more knowledge might nullify the evidence now overpowered
      the inclination to rest in uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;my errand is not
      so much to buy as to borrow. I dare say you go into rather heavy
      transactions occasionally.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I&rsquo;ve accommodated gentlemen of distinction&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      proud to say it. I wouldn&rsquo;t exchange my business with any in the
      world. There&rsquo;s none more honorable, nor more charitable, nor more
      necessary for all classes, from the good lady who wants a little of the
      ready for the baker, to a gentleman like yourself, sir, who may want it
      for amusement. I like my business, I like my street, and I like my shop. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have it a door further down. And I wouldn&rsquo;t be
      without a pawn-shop, sir, to be the Lord Mayor. It puts you in connection
      with the world at large. I say it&rsquo;s like the government revenue&mdash;it
      embraces the brass as well as the gold of the country. And a man who doesn&rsquo;t
      get money, sir, can&rsquo;t accommodate. Now, what can I do for <i>you</i>,
      sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If an amiable self-satisfaction is the mark of earthly bliss, Solomon in
      all his glory was a pitiable mortal compared with Mr. Cohen&mdash;clearly
      one of those persons, who, being in excellent spirits about themselves,
      are willing to cheer strangers by letting them know it. While he was
      delivering himself with lively rapidity, he took the baby from his wife
      and holding it on his arm presented his features to be explored by its
      small fists. Deronda, not in a cheerful mood, was rashly pronouncing this
      Ezra Cohen to be the most unpoetic Jew he had ever met with in books or
      life: his phraseology was as little as possible like that of the Old
      Testament: and no shadow of a suffering race distinguished his vulgarity
      of soul from that of a prosperous, pink-and-white huckster of the purest
      English lineage. It is naturally a Christian feeling that a Jew ought not
      to be conceited. However, this was no reason for not persevering in his
      project, and he answered at once in adventurous ignorance of
      technicalities,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a fine diamond ring to offer as security&mdash;not with me
      at this moment, unfortunately, for I am not in the habit of wearing it.
      But I will come again this evening and bring it with me. Fifty pounds at
      once would be a convenience to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know, this evening is the Sabbath, young gentleman,&rdquo;
      said Cohen, &ldquo;and I go to the <i>Shool</i>. The shop will be closed.
      But accommodation is a work of charity; if you can&rsquo;t get here
      before, and are any ways pressed&mdash;why, I&rsquo;ll look at your
      diamond. You&rsquo;re perhaps from the West End&mdash;a longish drive?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and your Sabbath begins early at this season. I could be here
      by five&mdash;will that do?&rdquo; Deronda had not been without hope that
      by asking to come on a Friday evening he might get a better opportunity of
      observing points in the family character, and might even be able to put
      some decisive question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cohen assented; but here the marvelous Jacob, whose <i>physique</i>
      supported a precocity that would have shattered a Gentile of his years,
      showed that he had been listening with much comprehension by saying,
      &ldquo;You are coming again. Have you got any more knives at home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have one,&rdquo; said Deronda, smiling down at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it two blades and a hook&mdash;and a white handle like that?&rdquo;
      said Jacob, pointing to the waistcoat-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say it has.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like a cork-screw?&rdquo; said Jacob, exhibiting that
      article in his own knife again, and looking up with serious inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Deronda, experimentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring your knife, then, and we&rsquo;ll shwop,&rdquo; said Jacob,
      returning the knife to his pocket, and stamping about with the sense that
      he had concluded a good transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grandmother had now recovered her usual manners, and the whole family
      watched Deronda radiantly when he caressingly lifted the little girl, to
      whom he had not hitherto given attention, and seating her on the counter,
      asked for her name also. She looked at him in silence, and put her fingers
      to her gold earrings, which he did not seem to have noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adelaide Rebekah is her name,&rdquo; said her mother, proudly.
      &ldquo;Speak to the gentleman, lovey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shlav&rsquo;m Shabbes fyock on,&rdquo; said Adelaide Rebekah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her Sabbath frock, she means,&rdquo; said the father, in
      explanation. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have her Sabbath frock on this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you let me see you in it, Adelaide?&rdquo; said Deronda,
      with that gentle intonation which came very easily to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say yes, lovey&mdash;yes, if you please, sir,&rdquo; said her
      mother, enchanted with this handsome young gentleman, who appreciated
      remarkable children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you give me a kiss this evening?&rdquo; said Deronda with
      a hand on each of her little brown shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adelaide Rebekah (her miniature crinoline and monumental features
      corresponded with the combination of her names) immediately put up her
      lips to pay the kiss in advance; whereupon her father rising in still more
      glowing satisfaction with the general meritoriousness of his
      circumstances, and with the stranger who was an admiring witness, said
      cordially,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see there&rsquo;s somebody will be disappointed if you don&rsquo;t
      come this evening, sir. You won&rsquo;t mind sitting down in our family
      place and waiting a bit for me, if I&rsquo;m not in when you come, sir? I&rsquo;ll
      stretch a point to accommodate a gent of your sort. Bring the diamond, and
      I&rsquo;ll see what I can do for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda thus left the most favorable impression behind him, as a
      preparation for more easy intercourse. But for his own part those
      amenities had been carried on under the heaviest spirits. If these were
      really Mirah&rsquo;s relatives, he could not imagine that even her fervid
      filial piety could give the reunion with them any sweetness beyond such as
      could be found in the strict fulfillment of a painful duty. What did this
      vaunting brother need? And with the most favorable supposition about the
      hypothetic mother, Deronda shrank from the image of a first meeting
      between her and Mirah, and still more from the idea of Mirah&rsquo;s
      domestication with this family. He took refuge in disbelief. To find an
      Ezra Cohen when the name was running in your head was no more
      extraordinary than to find a Josiah Smith under like circumstances; and as
      to the coincidence about the daughter, it would probably turn out to be a
      difference. If, however, further knowledge confirmed the more undesirable
      conclusion, what would be wise expediency?&mdash;to try and determine the
      best consequences by concealment, or to brave other consequences for the
      sake of that openness which is the sweet fresh air of our moral life.

</pre>
    <p>
      When Deronda arrived at five o&rsquo;clock, the shop was closed and the
      door was opened for him by the Christian servant. When she showed him into
      the room behind the shop he was surprised at the prettiness of the scene.
      The house was old, and rather extensive at the back: probably the large
      room he now entered was gloomy by daylight, but now it was agreeably lit
      by a fine old brass lamp with seven oil-lights hanging above the
      snow-white cloth spread on the central table. The ceiling and walls were
      smoky, and all the surroundings were dark enough to throw into relief the
      human figures, which had a Venetian glow of coloring. The grandmother was
      arrayed in yellowish brown with a large gold chain in lieu of the
      necklace, and by this light her yellow face with its darkly-marked
      eyebrows and framing roll of gray hair looked as handsome as was necessary
      for picturesque effect. Young Mrs. Cohen was clad in red and black, with a
      string of large artificial pearls wound round and round her neck: the baby
      lay asleep in the cradle under a scarlet counterpane; Adelaide Rebekah was
      in braided amber, and Jacob Alexander was in black velveteen with scarlet
      stockings. As the four pairs of black eyes all glistened a welcome at
      Deronda, he was almost ashamed of the supercilious dislike these
      happy-looking creatures had raised in him by daylight. Nothing could be
      more cordial than the greeting he received, and both mother and
      grandmother seemed to gather more dignity from being seen on the private
      hearth, showing hospitality. He looked round with some wonder at the old
      furniture: the oaken bureau and high side-table must surely be mere
      matters of chance and economy, and not due to the family taste. A large
      dish of blue and yellow ware was set up on the side-table, and flanking it
      were two old silver vessels; in front of them a large volume in darkened
      vellum with a deep-ribbed back. In the corner at the farther end was an
      open door into an inner room, where there was also a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda took in these details by parenthetic glances while he met Jacob&rsquo;s
      pressing solicitude about the knife. He had taken the pains to buy one
      with the requisites of the hook and white handle, and produced it on
      demand, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the sort of thing you want, Jacob?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was subjected to a severe scrutiny, the hook and blades were opened,
      and the article of barter with the cork-screw was drawn forth for
      comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you like a hook better than a cork-screw?&rdquo; said
      Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Caush I can get hold of things with a hook. A corkscrew won&rsquo;t
      go into anything but corks. But it&rsquo;s better for you, you can draw
      corks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You agree to change, then?&rdquo; said Deronda, observing that the
      grandmother was listening with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else have you got in your pockets?&rdquo; said Jacob, with
      deliberative seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush, Jacob, love,&rdquo; said the grandmother. And Deronda,
      mindful of discipline, answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I must not tell you that. Our business was with the knives.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob looked up into his face scanningly for a moment or two, and
      apparently arriving at his conclusions, said gravely,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shwop,&rdquo; handing the cork-screw knife to Deronda,
      who pocketed it with corresponding gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately the small son of Shem ran off into the next room, whence his
      voice was heard in rapid chat; and then ran back again&mdash;when, seeing
      his father enter, he seized a little velveteen hat which lay on a chair
      and put it on to approach him. Cohen kept on his own hat, and took no
      notice of the visitor, but stood still while the two children went up to
      him and clasped his knees: then he laid his hands on each in turn and
      uttered his Hebrew benediction; whereupon the wife, who had lately taken
      baby from the cradle, brought it up to her husband and held it under his
      outstretched hands, to be blessed in its sleep. For the moment, Deronda
      thought that this pawnbroker, proud of his vocation, was not utterly
      prosaic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, you found your welcome in my family, I think,&rdquo;
      said Cohen, putting down his hat and becoming his former self. &ldquo;And
      you&rsquo;ve been punctual. Nothing like a little stress here,&rdquo; he
      added, tapping his side pocket as he sat down. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good for
      us all in our turn. I&rsquo;ve felt it when I&rsquo;ve had to make up
      payments. I began to fit every sort of box. It&rsquo;s bracing to the
      mind. Now then! let us see, let us see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the ring I spoke of,&rdquo; said Deronda, taking it from
      his finger. &ldquo;I believe it cost a hundred pounds. It will be a
      sufficient pledge to you for fifty, I think. I shall probably redeem it in
      a month or so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cohen&rsquo;s glistening eyes seemed to get a little nearer together as he
      met the ingenuous look of this crude young gentleman, who apparently
      supposed that redemption was a satisfaction to pawnbrokers. He took the
      ring, examined and returned it, saying with indifference, &ldquo;Good,
      good. We&rsquo;ll talk of it after our meal. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll join us,
      if you&rsquo;ve no objection. Me and my wife&rsquo;ll feel honored, and so
      will mother; won&rsquo;t you, mother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The invitation was doubly echoed, and Deronda gladly accepted it. All now
      turned and stood round the table. No dish was at present seen except one
      covered with a napkin; and Mrs. Cohen had placed a china bowl near her
      husband that he might wash his hands in it. But after putting on his hat
      again, he paused, and called in a loud voice, &ldquo;Mordecai!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Can this be part of the religious ceremony? thought Deronda, not knowing
      what might be expected of the ancient hero. But he heard a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;
      from the next room, which made him look toward the open door; and there,
      to his astonishment, he saw the figure of the enigmatic Jew whom he had
      this morning met with in the book-shop. Their eyes met, and Mordecai
      looked as much surprised as Deronda&mdash;neither in his surprise making
      any sign of recognition. But when Mordecai was seating himself at the end
      of the table, he just bent his head to the guest in a cold and distant
      manner, as if the disappointment of the morning remained a disagreeable
      association with this new acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cohen now washed his hands, pronouncing Hebrew words the while: afterward,
      he took off the napkin covering the dish and disclosed the two long flat
      loaves besprinkled with seed&mdash;the memorial of the manna that fed the
      wandering forefathers&mdash;and breaking off small pieces gave one to each
      of the family, including Adelaide Rebekah, who stood on the chair with her
      whole length exhibited in her amber-colored garment, her little Jewish
      nose lengthened by compression of the lip in the effort to make a suitable
      appearance. Cohen then uttered another Hebrew blessing, and after that,
      the male heads were uncovered, all seated themselves, and the meal went on
      without any peculiarity that interested Deronda. He was not very conscious
      of what dishes he ate from; being preoccupied with a desire to turn the
      conversation in a way that would enable him to ask some leading question;
      and also thinking of Mordecai, between whom and himself there was an
      exchange of fascinated, half-furtive glances. Mordecai had no handsome
      Sabbath garment, but instead of the threadbare rusty black coat of the
      morning he wore one of light drab, which looked as if it had once been a
      handsome loose paletot now shrunk with washing; and this change of
      clothing gave a still stronger accentuation to his dark-haired, eager face
      which might have belonged to the prophet Ezekiel&mdash;also probably not
      modish in the eyes of contemporaries. It was noticeable that the thin
      tails of the fried fish were given to Mordecai; and in general the sort of
      share assigned to a poor relation&mdash;no doubt a &ldquo;survival&rdquo;
      of prehistoric practice, not yet generally admitted to be superstitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cohen kept up the conversation with much liveliness, introducing as
      subjects always in taste (the Jew is proud of his loyalty) the Queen and
      the Royal Family, the Emperor and Empress of the French&mdash;into which
      both grandmother and wife entered with zest. Mrs. Cohen the younger showed
      an accurate memory of distinguished birthdays; and the elder assisted her
      son in informing the guest of what occurred when the Emperor and Empress
      were in England and visited the city ten years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you know all about it better than we do, sir,&rdquo;
      said Cohen, repeatedly, by way of preface to full information; and the
      interesting statements were kept up in a trio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our baby is named <i>Eu</i>genie Esther,&rdquo; said young Mrs.
      Cohen, vivaciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful how the Emperor&rsquo;s like a cousin of mine
      in the face,&rdquo; said the grandmother; &ldquo;it struck me like
      lightning when I caught sight of him. I couldn&rsquo;t have thought it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother and me went to see the Emperor and Empress at the Crystal
      Palace,&rdquo; said Mr. Cohen. &ldquo;I had a fine piece of work to take
      care of, mother; she might have been squeezed flat&mdash;though she was
      pretty near as lusty then as she is now. I said if I had a hundred mothers
      I&rsquo;d never take one of &lsquo;em to see the Emperor and Empress at
      the Crystal Palace again; and you may think a man can&rsquo;t afford it
      when he&rsquo;s got but one mother&mdash;not if he&rsquo;d ever so big an
      insurance on her.&rdquo; He stroked his mother&rsquo;s shoulder
      affectionately, and chuckled a little at his own humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother has been a widow a long while, perhaps,&rdquo; said
      Deronda, seizing his opportunity. &ldquo;That has made your care for her
      the more needful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, it&rsquo;s a good many <i>yore-zeit</i> since I had to
      manage for her and myself,&rdquo; said Cohen quickly. &ldquo;I went early
      to it. It&rsquo;s that makes you a sharp knife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does&mdash;what makes a sharp knife, father?&rdquo; said
      Jacob, his cheek very much swollen with sweet-cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father winked at his guest and said, &ldquo;Having your nose put on
      the grindstone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob slipped from his chair with the piece of sweet-cake in his hand, and
      going close up to Mordecai, who had been totally silent hitherto, said,
      &ldquo;What does that mean&mdash;putting my nose to the grindstone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means that you are to bear being hurt without making a noise,&rdquo;
      said Mordecai, turning his eyes benignantly on the small face close to
      his. Jacob put the corner of the cake into Mordecai&rsquo;s mouth as an
      invitation to bite, saying meanwhile, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t though,&rdquo;
      and keeping his eyes on the cake to observe how much of it went in this
      act of generosity. Mordecai took a bite and smiled, evidently meaning to
      please the lad, and the little incident made them both look more lovable.
      Deronda, however, felt with some vexation that he had taken little by his
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy that is the right quarter for learning,&rdquo; said he,
      carrying on the subject that he might have an excuse for addressing
      Mordecai, to whom he turned and said, &ldquo;You have been a great
      student, I imagine?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have studied,&rdquo; was the quiet answer. &ldquo;And you?&mdash;You
      know German by the book you were buying.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have studied in Germany. Are you generally engaged in
      bookselling?&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I only go to Mr. Ram&rsquo;s shop every day to keep it while he
      goes to meals,&rdquo; said Mordecai, who was now looking at Deronda with
      what seemed a revival of his original interest: it seemed as if the face
      had some attractive indication for him which now neutralized the former
      disappointment. After a slight pause, he said, &ldquo;Perhaps you know
      Hebrew?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to say, not at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai&rsquo;s countenance fell: he cast down his eyelids, looking at
      his hands, which lay crossed before him, and said no more. Deronda had now
      noticed more decisively than in their former interview a difficulty in
      breathing, which he thought must be a sign of consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had something else to do than to get book-learning.&rdquo;
      said Mr. Cohen,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had to make myself knowing about
      useful things. I know stones well,&rdquo;&mdash;here he pointed to Deronda&rsquo;s
      ring. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of taking that ring of yours at my own
      valuation. But now,&rdquo; he added, with a certain drop in his voice to a
      lower, more familiar nasal, &ldquo;what do you want for it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty or sixty pounds,&rdquo; Deronda answered, rather too
      carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cohen paused a little, thrust his hands into his pockets, fixed on Deronda
      a pair of glistening eyes that suggested a miraculous guinea-pig, and
      said, &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t do you that. Happy to oblige, but couldn&rsquo;t
      go that lengths. Forty pound&mdash;say forty&mdash;I&rsquo;ll let you have
      forty on it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda was aware that Mordecai had looked up again at the words implying
      a monetary affair, and was now examining him again, while he said, &ldquo;Very
      well, I shall redeem it in a month or so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. I&rsquo;ll make you out the ticket by-and-by,&rdquo; said
      Cohen, indifferently. Then he held up his finger as a sign that
      conversation must be deferred. He, Mordecai and Jacob put on their hats,
      and Cohen opened a thanksgiving, which was carried on by responses, till
      Mordecai delivered himself alone at some length, in a solemn chanting
      tone, with his chin slightly uplifted and his thin hands clasped easily
      before him. Not only in his accent and tone, but in his freedom from the
      self-consciousness which has reference to others&rsquo; approbation, there
      could hardly have been a stronger contrast to the Jew at the other end of
      the table. It was an unaccountable conjunction&mdash;the presence among
      these common, prosperous, shopkeeping types, of a man who, in an emaciated
      threadbare condition, imposed a certain awe on Deronda, and an
      embarrassment at not meeting his expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had Mordecai finished his devotional strain, than rising, with a
      slight bend of his head to the stranger, he walked back into his room, and
      shut the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems to be rather a remarkable man,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      turning to Cohen, who immediately set up his shoulders, put out his tongue
      slightly, and tapped his own brow. It was clearly to be understood that
      Mordecai did not come up to the standard of sanity which was set by Mr.
      Cohen&rsquo;s view of men and things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he belong to your family?&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea appeared to be rather ludicrous to the ladies as well as to
      Cohen, and the family interchanged looks of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Cohen. &ldquo;Charity! charity! he worked for
      me, and when he got weaker and weaker I took him in. He&rsquo;s an
      incumbrance; but he brings a blessing down, and he teaches the boy.
      Besides, he does the repairing at the watches and jewelry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda hardly abstained from smiling at this mixture of kindliness and
      the desire to justify it in the light of a calculation; but his
      willingness to speak further of Mordecai, whose character was made the
      more enigmatically striking by these new details, was baffled. Mr. Cohen
      immediately dismissed the subject by reverting to the &ldquo;accommodation,&rdquo;
      which was also an act of charity, and proceeded to make out the ticket,
      get the forty pounds, and present them both in exchange for the diamond
      ring. Deronda, feeling that it would be hardly delicate to protract his
      visit beyond the settlement of the business which was its pretext, had to
      take his leave, with no more decided result than the advance of forty
      pounds and the pawn-ticket in his breast-pocket, to make a reason for
      returning when he came up to town after Christmas. He was resolved that he
      would then endeavor to gain a little more insight into the character and
      history of Mordecai; from whom also he might gather something decisive
      about the Cohens&mdash;for example, the reason why it was forbidden to ask
      Mrs. Cohen the elder whether she had a daughter.

      CHAPTER XXXV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Were uneasiness of conscience measured by extent of crime, human
    history had been different, and one should look to see the contrivers
    of greedy wars and the mighty marauders of the money-market in one
    troop of self-lacerating penitents with the meaner robber and
    cut-purse and the murderer that doth his butchery in small with his own
    hand. No doubt wickedness hath its rewards to distribute; but who so
    wins in this devil&rsquo;s game must needs be baser, more cruel, more brutal
    than the order of this planet will allow for the multitude born of
    woman, the most of these carrying a form of conscience&mdash;a fear which
    is the shadow of justice, a pity which is the shadow of love&mdash;that
    hindereth from the prize of serene wickedness, itself difficult of
    maintenance in our composite flesh.
</pre>
    <p>
      On the twenty-ninth of December Deronda knew that the Grandcourts had
      arrived at the Abbey, but he had had no glimpse of them before he went to
      dress for dinner. There had been a splendid fall of snow, allowing the
      party of children the rare pleasures of snow-balling and snow-building,
      and in the Christmas holidays the Mallinger girls were content with no
      amusement unless it were joined in and managed by &ldquo;cousin,&rdquo; as
      they had always called Deronda. After that outdoor exertion he had been
      playing billiards, and thus the hours had passed without his dwelling at
      all on the prospect of meeting Gwendolen at dinner. Nevertheless that
      prospect was interesting to him; and when, a little tired and heated with
      working at amusement, he went to his room before the half-hour bell had
      rung, he began to think of it with some speculation on the sort of
      influence her marriage with Grandcourt would have on her, and on the
      probability that there would be some discernible shades of change in her
      manner since he saw her at Diplow, just as there had been since his first
      vision of her at Leubronn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy there are some natures one could see growing or
      degenerating every day, if one watched them,&rdquo; was his thought.
      &ldquo;I suppose some of us go on faster than others: and I am sure she is
      a creature who keeps strong traces of anything that has once impressed
      her. That little affair of the necklace, and the idea that somebody
      thought her gambling wrong, had evidently bitten into her. But such
      impressibility leads both ways: it may drive one to desperation as soon as
      to anything better. And whatever fascinations Grandcourt may have for
      capricious tastes&mdash;good heavens! who can believe that he would call
      out the tender affections in daily companionship? One might be tempted to
      horsewhip him for the sake of getting some show of passion into his face
      and speech. I&rsquo;m afraid she married him out of ambition&mdash;to
      escape poverty. But why did she run out of his way at first? The poverty
      came after, though. Poor thing! she may have been urged into it. How can
      one feel anything else than pity for a young creature like that&mdash;full
      of unused life&mdash;ignorantly rash&mdash;hanging all her blind
      expectations on that remnant of a human being.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless the phrases which Deronda&rsquo;s meditation applied to the
      bridegroom were the less complimentary for the excuses and pity in which
      it clad the bride. His notion of Grandcourt as a &ldquo;remnant&rdquo; was
      founded on no particular knowledge, but simply on the impression which
      ordinary polite intercourse had given him that Grandcourt had worn out all
      his natural healthy interest in things.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, one may be sure that whenever a marriage of any mark takes
      place, male acquaintances are likely to pity the bride, female
      acquaintances the bridegroom: each, it is thought, might have done better;
      and especially where the bride is charming, young gentlemen on the scene
      are apt to conclude that she can have no real attachment to a fellow so
      uninteresting to themselves as her husband, but has married him on other
      grounds. Who, under such circumstances, pities the husband? Even his
      female friends are apt to think his position retributive: he should have
      chosen some one else. But perhaps Deronda may be excused that he did not
      prepare any pity for Grandcourt, who had never struck acquaintances as
      likely to come out of his experiences with more suffering than he
      inflicted; whereas, for Gwendolen, young, headlong, eager for pleasure,
      fed with the flattery which makes a lovely girl believe in her divine
      right to rule&mdash;how quickly might life turn from expectancy to a
      bitter sense of the irremediable! After what he had seen of her he must
      have had rather dull feelings not to have looked forward with some
      interest to her entrance into the room. Still, since the honeymoon was
      already three weeks in the distance, and Gwendolen had been enthroned, not
      only at Ryelands, but at Diplow, she was likely to have composed her
      countenance with suitable manifestation or concealment, not being one who
      would indulge the curious by a helpless exposure of her feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      A various party had been invited to meet the new couple; the old
      aristocracy was represented by Lord and Lady Pentreath; the old gentry by
      young Mr. and Mrs. Fitzadam of the Worcestershire branch of the Fitzadams;
      politics and the public good, as specialized in the cider interest, by Mr.
      Fenn, member for West Orchards, accompanied by his two daughters; Lady
      Mallinger&rsquo;s family, by her brother, Mr. Raymond, and his wife; the
      useful bachelor element by Mr. Sinker, the eminent counsel, and by Mr.
      Vandernoodt, whose acquaintance Sir Hugo had found pleasant enough at
      Leubronn to be adopted in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      All had assembled in the drawing-room before the new couple appeared.
      Meanwhile, the time was being passed chiefly in noticing the children&mdash;various
      little Raymonds, nephews and nieces of Lady Mallinger&rsquo;s with her own
      three girls, who were always allowed to appear at this hour. The scene was
      really delightful&mdash;enlarged by full-length portraits with deep
      backgrounds, inserted in the cedar paneling&mdash;surmounted by a ceiling
      that glowed with the rich colors of the coats of arms ranged between the
      sockets&mdash;illuminated almost as much by the red fire of oak-boughs as
      by the pale wax-lights&mdash;stilled by the deep-piled carpet and by the
      high English breeding that subdues all voices; while the mixture of ages,
      from the white-haired Lord and Lady Pentreath to the four-year-old Edgar
      Raymond, gave a varied charm to the living groups. Lady Mallinger, with
      fair matronly roundness and mildly prominent blue eyes, moved about in her
      black velvet, carrying a tiny white dog on her arm as a sort of finish to
      her costume; the children were scattered among the ladies, while most of
      the gentlemen were standing rather aloof, conversing with that very
      moderate vivacity observable during the long minutes before dinner.
      Deronda was a little out of the circle in a dialogue fixed upon him by Mr.
      Vandernoodt, a man of the best Dutch blood imported at the revolution: for
      the rest, one of those commodious persons in society who are nothing
      particular themselves, but are understood to be acquainted with the best
      in every department; close-clipped, pale-eyed, <i>nonchalant</i>, as good
      a foil as could well be found to the intense coloring and vivid gravity of
      Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was talking of the bride and bridegroom, whose appearance was being
      waited for. Mr. Vandernoodt was an industrious gleaner of personal
      details, and could probably tell everything about a great philosopher or
      physicist except his theories or discoveries; he was now implying that he
      had learned many facts about Grandcourt since meeting him at Leubronn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men who have seen a good deal of life don&rsquo;t always end by
      choosing their wives so well. He has had rather an anecdotic history&mdash;gone
      rather deep into pleasures, I fancy, lazy as he is. But, of course, you
      know all about him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really,&rdquo; said Deronda, in an indifferent tone. &ldquo;I
      know little more of him than that he is Sir Hugo&rsquo;s nephew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the door opened and deferred any satisfaction of Mr. Vandernoodt&rsquo;s
      communicativeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was one to set off any figure of distinction that entered on it,
      and certainly when Mr. and Mrs. Grandcourt entered, no beholder could deny
      that their figures had distinction. The bridegroom had neither more nor
      less easy perfection of costume, neither more nor less well-cut
      impassibility of face, than before his marriage. It was to be supposed of
      him that he would put up with nothing less than the best in outward
      equipment, wife included; and the bride was what he might have been
      expected to choose. &ldquo;By George, I think she&rsquo;s handsomer, if
      anything!&rdquo; said Mr. Vandernoodt. And Deronda was of the same
      opinion, but he said nothing. The white silk and diamonds&mdash;it may
      seem strange, but she did wear diamonds on her neck, in her ears, in her
      hair&mdash;might have something to do with the new imposingness of her
      beauty, which flashed on him as more unquestionable if not more thoroughly
      satisfactory than when he had first seen her at the gaming-table. Some
      faces which are peculiar in their beauty are like original works of art:
      for the first time they are almost always met with question. But in seeing
      Gwendolen at Diplow, Deronda had discerned in her more than he had
      expected of that tender appealing charm which we call womanly. Was there
      any new change since then? He distrusted his impressions; but as he saw
      her receiving greetings with what seemed a proud cold quietude and a
      superficial smile, there seemed to be at work within her the same demonic
      force that had possessed her when she took him in her resolute glance and
      turned away a loser from the gaming-table. There was no time for more of a
      conclusion&mdash;no time even for him to give his greeting before the
      summons to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat not far from opposite to her at table, and could sometimes hear
      what she said in answer to Sir Hugo, who was at his liveliest in
      conversation with her; but though he looked toward her with the intention
      of bowing, she gave him no opportunity of doing so for some time. At last
      Sir Hugo, who might have imagined that they had already spoken to each
      other, said, &ldquo;Deronda, you will like to hear what Mrs. Grandcourt
      tells me about your favorite Klesmer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s eyelids had been lowered, and Deronda, already looking
      at her, thought he discovered a quivering reluctance as she was obliged to
      raise them and return his unembarrassed bow and smile, her own smile being
      one of the lip merely. It was but an instant, and Sir Hugo continued
      without pause,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Arrowpoints have condoned the marriage, and he is spending the
      Christmas with his bride at Quetcham.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he will be glad of it for the sake of his wife, else I
      dare say he would not have minded keeping at a distance,&rdquo; said
      Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sort of troubadour story,&rdquo; said Lady Pentreath,
      an easy, deep-voiced old lady; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to find a little
      romance left among us. I think our young people now are getting too
      worldly wise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shows the Arrowpoints&rsquo; good sense, however, to have
      adopted the affair, after the fuss in the paper,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo.
      &ldquo;And disowning your own child because of a <i>mésalliance</i> is
      something like disowning your one eye: everybody knows it&rsquo;s yours,
      and you have no other to make an appearance with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to <i>mésalliance</i>, there&rsquo;s no blood on any side,&rdquo;
      said Lady Pentreath. &ldquo;Old Admiral Arrowpoint was one of Nelson&rsquo;s
      men, you know&mdash;a doctor&rsquo;s son. And we all know how the mother&rsquo;s
      money came.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they were any <i>mésalliance</i> in the case, I should say it
      was on Klesmer&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you think it is a case of the immortal marrying the mortal.
      What is your opinion?&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, looking at Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt that Herr Klesmer thinks himself immortal. But I
      dare say his wife will burn as much incense before him as he requires,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen. She had recovered any composure that she might have lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you approve of a wife burning incense before her
      husband?&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, with an air of jocoseness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, &ldquo;if it were only to make
      others believe in him.&rdquo; She paused a moment and then said with more
      gayety, &ldquo;When Herr Klesmer admires his own genius, it will take off
      some of the absurdity if his wife says Amen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Klesmer is no favorite of yours, I see,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think very highly of him, I assure you,&rdquo; said Gwendolen.
      &ldquo;His genius is quite above my judgment, and I know him to be
      exceedingly generous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with the sudden seriousness which is often meant to correct an
      unfair or indiscreet sally, having a bitterness against Klesmer in her
      secret soul which she knew herself unable to justify. Deronda was
      wondering what he should have thought of her if he had never heard of her
      before: probably that she put on a little hardness and defiance by way of
      concealing some painful consciousness&mdash;if, indeed, he could imagine
      her manners otherwise than in the light of his suspicion. But why did she
      not recognize him with more friendliness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Hugo, by way of changing the subject, said to her, &ldquo;Is not this
      a beautiful room? It was part of the refectory of the Abbey. There was a
      division made by those pillars and the three arches, and afterward they
      were built up. Else it was half as large again originally. There used to
      be rows of Benedictines sitting where we are sitting. Suppose we were
      suddenly to see the lights burning low and the ghosts of the old monks
      rising behind all our chairs!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a playful shudder.
      &ldquo;It is very nice to come after ancestors and monks, but they should
      know their places and keep underground. I should be rather frightened to
      go about this house all alone. I suppose the old generations must be angry
      with us because we have altered things so much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the ghosts must be of all political parties,&rdquo; said Sir
      Hugo. &ldquo;And those fellows who wanted to change things while they
      lived and couldn&rsquo;t do it must be on our side. But if you would not
      like to go over the house alone, you will like to go in company, I hope.
      You and Grandcourt ought to see it all. And we will ask Deronda to go
      round with us. He is more learned about it than I am.&rdquo; The baronet
      was in the most complaisant of humors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen stole a glance at Deronda, who must have heard what Sir Hugo
      said, for he had his face turned toward them helping himself to an <i>entrée</i>;
      but he looked as impassive as a picture. At the notion of Deronda&rsquo;s
      showing her and Grandcourt the place which was to be theirs, and which she
      with painful emphasis remembered might have been his (perhaps, if others
      had acted differently), certain thoughts had rushed in&mdash;thoughts
      repeated within her, but now returning on an occasion embarrassingly new;
      and was conscious of something furtive and awkward in her glance which Sir
      Hugo must have noticed. With her usual readiness of resource against
      betrayal, she said, playfully, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how much I am
      afraid of Mr. Deronda.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that? Because you think him too learned?&rdquo; said
      Sir Hugo, whom the peculiarity of her glance had not escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is ever since I first saw him at Leubronn. Because when he
      came to look on at the roulette-table, I began to lose. He cast an evil
      eye on my play. He didn&rsquo;t approve it. He has told me so. And now
      whatever I do before him, I am afraid he will cast an evil eye upon it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad! I&rsquo;m rather afraid of him myself when he doesn&rsquo;t
      approve,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, glancing at Deronda; and then turning his
      face toward Gwendolen, he said less audibly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
      ladies generally object to have his eyes upon them.&rdquo; The baronet&rsquo;s
      small chronic complaint of facetiousness was at this moment almost as
      annoying to Gwendolen as it often was to Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I object to any eyes that are critical,&rdquo; she said, in a cool,
      high voice, with a turn of her neck. &ldquo;Are there many of these old
      rooms left in the Abbey?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not many. There is a fine cloistered court with a long gallery
      above it. But the finest bit of all is turned into stables. It is part of
      the old church. When I improved the place I made the most of every other
      bit; but it was out of my reach to change the stables, so the horses have
      the benefit of the fine old choir. You must go and see it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall like to see the horses as well as the building,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have no stud to speak of. Grandcourt will look with contempt
      at my horses,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given up hunting,
      and go on in a jog-trot way, as becomes an old gentlemen with daughters.
      The fact is, I went in for doing too much at this place. We all lived at
      Diplow for two years while the alterations were going on: Do you like
      Diplow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not particularly,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with indifference. One
      would have thought that the young lady had all her life had more family
      seats than she cared to go to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it will not do after Ryelands,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, well
      pleased. &ldquo;Grandcourt, I know, took it for the sake of the hunting.
      But he found something so much better there,&rdquo; added the baronet,
      lowering his voice, &ldquo;that he might well prefer it to any other place
      in the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has one attraction for me,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, passing over
      this compliment with a chill smile, &ldquo;that it is within reach of
      Offendene.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand that,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, and then let the subject
      drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      What amiable baronet can escape the effect of a strong desire for a
      particular possession? Sir Hugo would have been glad that Grandcourt, with
      or without reason, should prefer any other place to Diplow; but inasmuch
      as in the pure process of wishing we can always make the conditions of our
      gratification benevolent, he did wish that Grandcourt&rsquo;s convenient
      disgust for Diplow should not be associated with his marriage with this
      very charming bride. Gwendolen was much to the baronet&rsquo;s taste, but,
      as he observed afterward to Lady Mallinger, he should never have taken her
      for a young girl who had married beyond her expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda had not heard much of this conversation, having given his
      attention elsewhere, but the glimpses he had of Gwendolen&rsquo;s manner
      deepened the impression that it had something newly artificial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, in the drawing-room, Deronda, at somebody&rsquo;s request, sat down
      to the piano and sang. Afterward, Mrs. Raymond took his place; and on
      rising he observed that Gwendolen had left her seat, and had come to this
      end of the room, as if to listen more fully, but was now standing with her
      back to every one, apparently contemplating a fine cowled head carved in
      ivory which hung over a small table. He longed to go to her and speak. Why
      should he not obey such an impulse, as he would have done toward any other
      lady in the room? Yet he hesitated some moments, observing the graceful
      lines of her back, but not moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any reason for not indulging a wish to speak to a fair woman,
      it is a bad plan to look long at her back: the wish to see what it screens
      becomes the stronger. There may be a very sweet smile on the other side.
      Deronda ended by going to the end of the small table, at right angles to
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s position, but before he could speak she had turned on
      him no smile, but such an appealing look of sadness, so utterly different
      from the chill effort of her recognition at table, that his speech was
      checked. For what was an appreciative space of time to both, though the
      observation of others could not have measured it, they looked at each
      other&mdash;she seeming to take the deep rest of confession, he with an
      answering depth of sympathy that neutralized all other feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not join in the music?&rdquo; he said, by way of meeting
      the necessity for speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      That her look of confession had been involuntary was shown by that just
      perceptible shake and change of countenance with which she roused herself
      to reply calmly, &ldquo;I join in it by listening. I am fond of music.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not a musician?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given a great deal of time to music. But I have not talent
      enough to make it worth while. I shall never sing again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you are fond of music, it will always be worth while in
      private, for your own delight. I make it a virtue to be content with my
      middlingness,&rdquo; said Deronda, smiling; &ldquo;it is always
      pardonable, so that one does not ask others to take it for superiority.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot imitate you,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, recovering her tone of
      artificial vivacity. &ldquo;To be middling with me is another phrase for
      being dull. And the worst fault I have to find with the world is that it
      is dull. Do you know, I am going to justify gambling in spite of you. It
      is a refuge from dullness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t admit the justification,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;I
      think what we call the dullness of things is a disease in ourselves. Else
      how can any one find an intense interest in life? And many do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see! The fault I find in the world is my own fault,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, smiling at him. Then after a moment, looking up at the
      ivory again, she said, &ldquo;Do <i>you</i> never find fault with the
      world or with others?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. When I am in a grumbling mood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hate people? Confess you hate them when they stand in your way&mdash;when
      their gain is your loss? That is your own phrase, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are often standing in each other&rsquo;s way when we can&rsquo;t
      help it. I think it is stupid to hate people on that ground.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if they injure you and could have helped it?&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen with a hard intensity unaccountable in incidental talk like
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda wondered at her choice of subjects. A painful impression arrested
      his answer a moment, but at last he said, with a graver, deeper
      intonation, &ldquo;Why, then, after all, I prefer my place to theirs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There I believe you are right,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a sudden
      little laugh, and turned to join the group at the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda looked around for Grandcourt, wondering whether he followed his
      bride&rsquo;s movements with any attention; but it was rather undiscerning
      to him to suppose that he could find out the fact. Grandcourt had a
      delusive mood of observing whatever had an interest for him, which could
      be surpassed by no sleepy-eyed animal on the watch for prey. At that
      moment he was plunged in the depth of an easy chair, being talked to by
      Mr. Vandernoodt, who apparently thought the acquaintance of such a
      bridegroom worth cultivating; and an incautious person might have supposed
      it safe to telegraph secrets in front of him, the common prejudice being
      that your quick observer is one whose eyes have quick movements. Not at
      all. If you want a respectable witness who will see nothing inconvenient,
      choose a vivacious gentleman, very much on the alert, with two eyes wide
      open, a glass in one of them, and an entire impartiality as to the purpose
      of looking. If Grandcourt cared to keep any one under his power he saw
      them out of the corners of his long narrow eyes, and if they went behind
      him he had a constructive process by which he knew what they were doing
      there. He knew perfectly well where his wife was, and how she was
      behaving. Was he going to be a jealous husband? Deronda imagined that to
      be likely; but his imagination was as much astray about Grandcourt as it
      would have been about an unexplored continent where all the species were
      peculiar. He did not conceive that he himself was a likely subject of
      jealousy, or that he should give any pretext for it; but the suspicion
      that a wife is not happy naturally leads one to speculate on the husband&rsquo;s
      private deportment; and Deronda found himself after one o&rsquo;clock in
      the morning in the rather ludicrous position of sitting up severely
      holding a Hebrew grammar in his hands (for somehow, in deference to
      Mordecai, he had begun to study Hebrew), with the consciousness that he
      had been in that attitude nearly an hour, and had thought of nothing but
      Gwendolen and her husband. To be an unusual young man means for the most
      part to get a difficult mastery over the usual, which is often like the
      sprite of ill-luck you pack up your goods to escape from, and see grinning
      at you from the top of your luggage van. The peculiarities of Deronda&rsquo;s
      nature had been acutely touched by the brief incident and words which made
      the history of his intercourse with Gwendolen; and this evening&rsquo;s
      slight addition had given them an importunate recurrence. It was not
      vanity&mdash;it was ready sympathy that had made him alive to a certain
      appealingness in her behavior toward him; and the difficulty with which
      she had seemed to raise her eyes to bow to him, in the first instance, was
      to be interpreted now by that unmistakable look of involuntary confidence
      which she had afterward turned on him under the consciousness of his
      approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of it all?&rdquo; thought Deronda, as he threw down
      his grammar, and began to undress. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything to
      help her&mdash;nobody can, if she has found out her mistake already. And
      it seems to me that she has a dreary lack of the ideas that might help
      her. Strange and piteous to think what a center of wretchedness a delicate
      piece of human flesh like that might be, wrapped round with fine raiment,
      her ears pierced for gems, her head held loftily, her mouth all smiling
      pretense, the poor soul within her sitting in sick distaste of all things!
      But what do I know of her? There may be a demon in her to match the worst
      husband, for what I can tell. She was clearly an ill-educated, worldly
      girl: perhaps she is a coquette.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This last reflection, not much believed in, was a self-administered dose
      of caution, prompted partly by Sir Hugo&rsquo;s much-contemned joking on
      the subject of flirtation. Deronda resolved not to volunteer any <i>tete-à-tete</i>
      with Gwendolen during the days of her stay at the Abbey; and he was
      capable of keeping a resolve in spite of much inclination to the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a man cannot resolve about a woman&rsquo;s actions, least of all about
      those of a woman like Gwendolen, in whose nature there was a combination
      of proud reserve with rashness, of perilously poised terror with defiance,
      which might alternately flatter and disappoint control. Few words could
      less represent her than &ldquo;coquette.&rdquo; She had native love of
      homage, and belief in her own power; but no cold artifice for the sake of
      enslaving. And the poor thing&rsquo;s belief in her power, with her other
      dreams before marriage, had often to be thrust aside now like the toys of
      a sick child, which it looks at with dull eyes, and has no heart to play
      with, however it may try.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day at lunch Sir Hugo said to her, &ldquo;The thaw has gone on
      like magic, and it&rsquo;s so pleasant out of doors just now&mdash;shall
      we go and see the stables and the other odd bits about the place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, pray,&rdquo; said Gwendolen. &ldquo;You will like to see the
      stables, Henleigh?&rdquo; she added, looking at her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncommonly,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, with an indifference which
      seemed to give irony to the word, as he returned her look. It was the
      first time Deronda had seen them speak to each other since their arrival,
      and he thought their exchange of looks as cold or official as if it had
      been a ceremony to keep up a charter. Still, the English fondness for
      reserve will account for much negation; and Grandcourt&rsquo;s manners
      with an extra veil of reserve over them might be expected to present the
      extreme type of the national taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else is inclined to make the tour of the house and premises?&rdquo;
      said Sir Hugo. &ldquo;The ladies must muffle themselves; there is only
      just about time to do it well before sunset. You will go, Dan, won&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Deronda, carelessly, knowing that Sir Hugo
      would think any excuse disobliging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All meet in the library, then, when they are ready&mdash;say in
      half an hour,&rdquo; said the baronet. Gwendolen made herself ready with
      wonderful quickness, and in ten minutes came down into the library in her
      sables, plume, and little thick boots. As soon as she entered the room she
      was aware that some one else was there: it was precisely what she had
      hoped for. Deronda was standing with his back toward her at the far end of
      the room, and was looking over a newspaper. How could little thick boots
      make any noise on an Axminster carpet? And to cough would have seemed an
      intended signaling which her pride could not condescend to; also, she felt
      bashful about walking up to him and letting him know that she was there,
      though it was her hunger to speak to him which had set her imagination on
      constructing this chance of finding him, and had made her hurry down, as
      birds hover near the water which they dare not drink. Always uneasily
      dubious about his opinion of her, she felt a peculiar anxiety to-day, lest
      he might think of her with contempt, as one triumphantly conscious of
      being Grandcourt&rsquo;s wife, the future lady of this domain. It was her
      habitual effort now to magnify the satisfactions of her pride, on which
      she nourished her strength; but somehow Deronda&rsquo;s being there
      disturbed them all. There was not the faintest touch of coquetry in the
      attitude of her mind toward him: he was unique to her among men, because
      he had impressed her as being not her admirer but her superior: in some
      mysterious way he was becoming a part of her conscience, as one woman
      whose nature is an object of reverential belief may become a new
      conscience to a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he would not look round and find out that she was there! The paper
      crackled in his hand, his head rose and sank, exploring those stupid
      columns, and he was evidently stroking his beard; as if this world were a
      very easy affair to her. Of course all the rest of the company would soon
      be down, and the opportunity of her saying something to efface her
      flippancy of the evening before, would be quite gone. She felt sick with
      irritation&mdash;so fast do young creatures like her absorb misery through
      invisible suckers of their own fancies&mdash;and her face had gathered
      that peculiar expression which comes with a mortification to which tears
      are forbidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he threw down the paper and turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are there already,&rdquo; he said, coming forward a step or
      two: &ldquo;I must go and put on my coat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned aside and walked out of the room. This was behaving quite badly.
      Mere politeness would have made him stay to exchange some words before
      leaving her alone. It was true that Grandcourt came in with Sir Hugo
      immediately after, so that the words must have been too few to be worth
      anything. As it was, they saw him walking from the library door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;you look rather ill,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, going straight
      up to her, standing in front of her, and looking into her eyes. &ldquo;Do
      you feel equal to the walk?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shall like it,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, without the slightest
      movement except this of the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could put off going over the house, you know, and only go out of
      doors,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, kindly, while Grandcourt turned aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear no!&rdquo; said Gwendolen, speaking with determination;
      &ldquo;let us put off nothing. I want a long walk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the walking party&mdash;two ladies and two gentlemen besides
      Deronda&mdash;had now assembled; and Gwendolen rallying, went with due
      cheerfulness by the side of Sir Hugo, paying apparently an equal attention
      to the commentaries Deronda was called upon to give on the various
      architectural fragments, to Sir Hugo&rsquo;s reasons for not attempting to
      remedy the mixture of the undisguised modern with the antique&mdash;which
      in his opinion only made the place the more truly historical. On their way
      to the buttery and kitchen they took the outside of the house and paused
      before a beautiful pointed doorway, which was the only old remnant in the
      east front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, to my mind,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, &ldquo;that is more
      interesting standing as it is in the middle of what is frankly four
      centuries later, than if the whole front had been dressed up in a pretense
      of the thirteenth century. Additions ought to smack of the time when they
      are made and carry the stamp of their period. I wouldn&rsquo;t destroy any
      old bits, but that notion of reproducing the old is a mistake, I think. At
      least, if a man likes to do it he must pay for his whistle. Besides, where
      are you to stop along that road&mdash;making loopholes where you don&rsquo;t
      want to peep, and so on? You may as well ask me to wear out the stones
      with kneeling; eh, Grandcourt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A confounded nuisance,&rdquo; drawled Grandcourt. &ldquo;I hate
      fellows wanting to howl litanies&mdash;acting the greatest bores that have
      ever existed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, that&rsquo;s what their romanticism must come to,&rdquo;
      said Sir Hugo, in a tone of confidential assent&mdash;&ldquo;that is if
      they carry it out logically.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that way of arguing against a course because it may be
      ridden down to an absurdity would soon bring life to a standstill,&rdquo;
      said Deronda. &ldquo;It is not the logic of human action, but of a
      roasting-jack, that must go on to the last turn when it has been once
      wound up. We can do nothing safely without some judgment as to where we
      are to stop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find the rule of the pocket the best guide,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo,
      laughingly. &ldquo;And as for most of your new-old building, you had need
      to hire men to scratch and chip it all over artistically to give it an
      elderly-looking surface; which at the present rate of labor would not
      answer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to keep up the old fashions, then, Mr. Deronda?&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, taking advantage of the freedom of grouping to fall back a
      little, while Sir Hugo and Grandcourt went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them. I don&rsquo;t see why we should not use our choice
      there as we do elsewhere&mdash;or why either age or novelty by itself is
      an argument for or against. To delight in doing things because our fathers
      did them is good if it shuts out nothing better; it enlarges the range of
      affection&mdash;and affection is the broadest basis of good in life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said Gwendolen with a little surprise.
      &ldquo;I should have thought you cared most about ideas, knowledge,
      wisdom, and all that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to care about <i>them</i> is a sort of affection,&rdquo; said
      Deronda, smiling at her sudden <i>naïveté</i>. &ldquo;Call it attachment;
      interest, willing to bear a great deal for the sake of being with them and
      saving them from injury. Of course, it makes a difference if the objects
      of interest are human beings; but generally in all deep affections the
      objects are a mixture&mdash;half persons and half ideas&mdash;sentiments
      and affections flow in together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether I understand that,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, putting
      up her chin in her old saucy manner. &ldquo;I believe I am not very
      affectionate; perhaps you mean to tell me, that is the reason why I don&rsquo;t
      see much good in life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I did <i>not</i> mean to tell you that; but I admit that I
      should think it true if I believed what you say of yourself,&rdquo; said
      Deronda, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Sir Hugo and Grandcourt turned round and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never can get Mr. Deronda to pay me a compliment,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen. &ldquo;I have quite a curiosity to see whether a little
      flattery can be extracted from him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, glancing at Deronda, &ldquo;the fact is,
      it is useless to flatter a bride. We give it up in despair. She has been
      so fed on sweet speeches that every thing we say seems tasteless.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, bending her head and smiling.
      &ldquo;Mr. Grandcourt won me by neatly-turned compliments. If there had
      been one word out of place it would have been fatal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, looking at the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, without change of countenance. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      a deucedly hard thing to keep up, though.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All this seemed to Sir Hugo a natural playfulness between such a husband
      and wife; but Deronda wondered at the misleading alternations in Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      manner, which at one moment seemed to excite sympathy by childlike
      indiscretion, at another to repel it by proud concealment. He tried to
      keep out of her way by devoting himself to Miss Juliet Fenn, a young lady
      whose profile had been so unfavorably decided by circumstances over which
      she had no control, that Gwendolen some months ago had felt it impossible
      to be jealous of her. Nevertheless, when they were seeing the kitchen&mdash;a
      part of the original building in perfect preservation&mdash;the depth of
      shadow in the niches of the stone-walls and groined vault, the play of
      light from the huge glowing fire on polished tin, brass, and copper, the
      fine resonance that came with every sound of voice or metal, were all
      spoiled for Gwendolen, and Sir Hugo&rsquo;s speech about them was made
      rather importunate, because Deronda was discoursing to the other ladies
      and kept at a distance from her. It did not signify that the other
      gentlemen took the opportunity of being near her: of what use in the world
      was their admiration while she had an uneasy sense that there was some
      standard in Deronda&rsquo;s mind which measured her into littleness? Mr.
      Vandernoodt, who had the mania of always describing one thing while you
      were looking at another, was quite intolerable with his insistence on Lord
      Blough&rsquo;s kitchen, which he had seen in the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t ask us to see two kitchens at once. It makes the
      heat double. I must really go out of it,&rdquo; she cried at last,
      marching resolutely into the open air, and leaving the others in the rear.
      Grandcourt was already out, and as she joined him, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wondered how long you meant to stay in that damned place&rdquo;&mdash;one
      of the freedoms he had assumed as a husband being the use of his strongest
      epithets. Gwendolen, turning to see the rest of the party approach, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was certainly rather too warm in one&rsquo;s wraps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on the gravel across a green court, where the snow still lay
      in islets on the grass, and in masses on the boughs of the great cedar and
      the crenelated coping of the stone walls, and then into a larger court,
      where there was another cedar, to find the beautiful choir long ago turned
      into stables, in the first instance perhaps after an impromptu fashion by
      troopers, who had a pious satisfaction in insulting the priests of Baal
      and the images of Ashtoreth, the queen of heaven. The exterior&mdash;its
      west end, save for the stable door, walled in with brick and covered with
      ivy&mdash;was much defaced, maimed of finial and gargoyle, the friable
      limestone broken and fretted, and lending its soft gray to a powdery dark
      lichen; the long windows, too, were filled in with brick as far as the
      springing of the arches, the broad clerestory windows with wire or
      ventilating blinds. With the low wintry afternoon sun upon it, sending
      shadows from the cedar boughs, and lighting up the touches of snow
      remaining on every ledge, it had still a scarcely disturbed aspect of
      antique solemnity, which gave the scene in the interior rather a startling
      effect; though, ecclesiastical or reverential indignation apart, the eyes
      could hardly help dwelling with pleasure on its piquant picturesqueness.
      Each finely-arched chapel was turned into a stall, where in the dusty
      glazing of the windows there still gleamed patches of crimson, orange,
      blue, and palest violet; for the rest, the choir had been gutted, the
      floor leveled, paved, and drained according to the most approved fashion,
      and a line of loose boxes erected in the middle: a soft light fell from
      the upper windows on sleek brown or gray flanks and haunches; on mild
      equine faces looking out with active nostrils over the varnished brown
      boarding; on the hay hanging from racks where the saints once looked down
      from the altar-pieces, and on the pale golden straw scattered or in heaps;
      on a little white-and-liver-colored spaniel making his bed on the back of
      an elderly hackney, and on four ancient angels, still showing signs of
      devotion like mutilated martyrs&mdash;while over all, the grand pointed
      roof, untouched by reforming wash, showed its lines and colors
      mysteriously through veiling shadow and cobweb, and a hoof now and then
      striking against the boards seemed to fill the vault with thunder, while
      outside there was the answering bay of the blood-hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is glorious!&rdquo; Gwendolen burst forth, in
      forgetfulness of everything but the immediate impression: there had been a
      little intoxication for her in the grand spaces of courts and building,
      and the fact of her being an important person among them. &ldquo;This <i>is</i>
      glorious! Only I wish there were a horse in every one of the boxes. I
      would ten times rather have these stables than those at Diplow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had no sooner said this than some consciousness arrested her, and
      involuntarily she turned her eyes toward Deronda, who oddly enough had
      taken off his felt hat and stood holding it before him as if they had
      entered a room or an actual church. He, like others, happened to be
      looking at her, and their eyes met&mdash;to her intense vexation, for it
      seemed to her that by looking at him she had betrayed the reference of her
      thoughts, and she felt herself blushing: she exaggerated the impression
      that even Sir Hugo as well as Deronda would have of her bad taste in
      referring to the possession of anything at the Abbey: as for Deronda, she
      had probably made him despise her. Her annoyance at what she imagined to
      be the obviousness of her confusion robbed her of her usual facility in
      carrying it off by playful speech, and turning up her face to look at the
      roof, she wheeled away in that attitude. If any had noticed her blush as
      significant, they had certainly not interpreted it by the secret windings
      and recesses of her feeling. A blush is no language: only a dubious
      flag-signal which may mean either of two contradictories. Deronda alone
      had a faint guess at some part of her feeling; but while he was observing
      her he was himself under observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you take off your hat to horses?&rdquo; said Grandcourt, with a
      slight sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Deronda, covering himself. He had really taken
      off the hat automatically, and if he had been an ugly man might doubtless
      have done so with impunity; ugliness having naturally the air of
      involuntary exposure, and beauty, of display.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s confusion was soon merged in the survey of the horses,
      which Grandcourt politely abstained from appraising, languidly assenting
      to Sir Hugo&rsquo;s alternate depreciation and eulogy of the same animal,
      as one that he should not have bought when he was younger, and piqued
      himself on his horses, but yet one that had better qualities than many
      more expensive brutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, stables dive deeper and deeper into the pocket
      nowadays, and I am very glad to have got rid of that <i>démangeaison</i>,&rdquo;
      said Sir Hugo, as they were coming out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a man to do, though?&rdquo; said Grandcourt. &ldquo;He must
      ride. I don&rsquo;t see what else there is to do. And I don&rsquo;t call
      it riding to sit astride a set of brutes with every deformity under the
      sun.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This delicate diplomatic way of characterizing Sir Hugo&rsquo;s stud did
      not require direct notice; and the baronet, feeling that the conversation
      had worn rather thin, said to the party generally, &ldquo;Now we are going
      to see the cloister&mdash;the finest bit of all&mdash;in perfect
      preservation; the monks might have been walking there yesterday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gwendolen had lingered behind to look at the kenneled blood-hounds,
      perhaps because she felt a little dispirited; and Grandcourt waited for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better take my arm,&rdquo; he said, in his low tone of
      command; and she took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great bore being dragged about in this way, and no
      cigar,&rdquo; said Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like it!&mdash;one eternal chatter. And encouraging those ugly
      girls&mdash;inviting one to meet such monsters. How that <i>fat</i>
      Deronda can bear looking at her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you call him a <i>fat</i>? Do you object to him so much?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Object? no. What do I care about his being a <i>fat</i>? It&rsquo;s
      of no consequence to me. I&rsquo;ll invite him to Diplow again if you
      like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he would come. He is too clever and learned to
      care about <i>us</i>,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, thinking it useful for her
      husband to be told (privately) that it was possible for him to be looked
      down upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw that make much difference in a man. Either he is a
      gentleman, or he is not,&rdquo; said Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a new husband and wife should snatch a moment&rsquo;s <i>tete-à-tete</i>
      was what could be understood and indulged; and the rest of the party left
      them in the rear till, re-entering the garden, they all paused in that
      cloistered court where, among the falling rose-petals thirteen years
      before, we saw a boy becoming acquainted with his first sorrow. This
      cloister was built of a harder stone than the church, and had been in
      greater safety from the wearing weather. It was a rare example of a
      northern cloister with arched and pillared openings not intended for
      glazing, and the delicately-wrought foliage of the capitals seemed still
      to carry the very touches of the chisel. Gwendolen had dropped her husband&rsquo;s
      arm and joined the other ladies, to whom Deronda was noticing the delicate
      sense which had combined freedom with accuracy in the imitation of natural
      forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether one oftener learns to love real objects through
      their representations, or the representations through the real objects,&rdquo;
      he said, after pointing out a lovely capital made by the curled leaves of
      greens, showing their reticulated under-side with the firm gradual swell
      of its central rib. &ldquo;When I was a little fellow these capitals
      taught me to observe and delight in the structure of leaves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you can see every line of them with your eyes shut,&rdquo;
      said Juliet Fenn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I was always repeating them, because for a good many years
      this court stood for me as my only image of a convent, and whenever I read
      of monks and monasteries, this was my scenery for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must love this place very much,&rdquo; said Miss Fenn,
      innocently, not thinking of inheritance. &ldquo;So many homes are like
      twenty others. But this is unique, and you seem to know every cranny of
      it. I dare say you could never love another home so well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I carry it with me,&rdquo; said Deronda, quietly, being used to
      all possible thoughts of this kind. &ldquo;To most men their early home is
      no more than a memory of their early years, and I&rsquo;m not sure but
      they have the best of it. The image is never marred. There&rsquo;s no
      disappointment in memory, and one&rsquo;s exaggerations are always on the
      good side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen felt sure that he spoke in that way out of delicacy to her and
      Grandcourt&mdash;because he knew they must hear him; and that he probably
      thought of her as a selfish creature who only cared about possessing
      things in her own person. But whatever he might say, it must have been a
      secret hardship to him that any circumstances of his birth had shut him
      out from the inheritance of his father&rsquo;s position; and if he
      supposed that she exulted in her husband&rsquo;s taking it, what could he
      feel for her but scornful pity? Indeed it seemed clear to her that he was
      avoiding her, and preferred talking to others&mdash;which nevertheless was
      not kind in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these thoughts in her mind she was prevented by a mixture of pride
      and timidity from addressing him again, and when they were looking at the
      rows of quaint portraits in the gallery above the cloisters, she kept up
      her air of interest and made her vivacious remarks without any direct
      appeal to Deronda. But at the end she was very weary of her assumed
      spirits, and as Grandcourt turned into the billiard-room, she went to the
      pretty boudoir which had been assigned to her, and shut herself up to look
      melancholy at her ease. No chemical process shows a more wonderful
      activity than the transforming influence of the thoughts we imagine to be
      going on in another. Changes in theory, religion, admirations, may begin
      with a suspicion of dissent or disapproval, even when the grounds of
      disapproval are but matter of searching conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Gwendolen was conscious of an uneasy, transforming process&mdash;all
      the old nature shaken to its depths, its hopes spoiled, its pleasures
      perturbed, but still showing wholeness and strength in the will to
      reassert itself. After every new shock of humiliation she tried to adjust
      herself and seize her old supports&mdash;proud concealment, trust in new
      excitements that would make life go by without much thinking; trust in
      some deed of reparation to nullify her self-blame and shield her from a
      vague, ever-visiting dread of some horrible calamity; trust in the
      hardening effect of use and wont that would make her indifferent to her
      miseries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;miseries. This beautiful, healthy young creature, with her
      two-and-twenty years and her gratified ambition, no longer felt inclined
      to kiss her fortunate image in the glass. She looked at it with wonder
      that she could be so miserable. One belief which had accompanied her
      through her unmarried life as a self-cajoling superstition, encouraged by
      the subordination of every one about her&mdash;the belief in her own power
      of dominating&mdash;was utterly gone. Already, in seven short weeks, which
      seemed half her life, her husband had gained a mastery which she could no
      more resist than she could have resisted the benumbing effect from the
      touch of a torpedo. Gwendolen&rsquo;s will had seemed imperious in its
      small girlish sway; but it was the will of a creature with a large
      discourse of imaginative fears: a shadow would have been enough to relax
      its hold. And she had found a will like that of a crab or a
      boa-constrictor, which goes on pinching or crushing without alarm at
      thunder. Not that Grandcourt was without calculation of the intangible
      effects which were the chief means of mastery; indeed, he had a surprising
      acuteness in detecting that situation of feeling in Gwendolen which made
      her proud and rebellious spirit dumb and helpless before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had burned Lydia Glasher&rsquo;s letter with an instantaneous terror
      lest other eyes should see it, and had tenaciously concealed from
      Grandcourt that there was any other cause of her violent hysterics than
      the excitement and fatigue of the day: she had been urged into an implied
      falsehood. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me&mdash;it was my feeling about
      everything&mdash;it was the sudden change from home.&rdquo; The words of
      that letter kept repeating themselves, and hung on her consciousness with
      the weight of a prophetic doom. &ldquo;I am the grave in which your chance
      of happiness is buried as well as mine. You had your warning. You have
      chosen to injure me and my children. He had meant to marry me. He would
      have married me at last, if you had not broken your word. You will have
      your punishment. I desire it with all my soul. Will you give him this
      letter to set him against me and ruin us more&mdash;me and my children?
      Shall you like to stand before your husband with these diamonds on you,
      and these words of mine in his thoughts and yours? Will he think you have
      any right to complain when he has made you miserable? You took him with
      your eyes open. The willing wrong you have done me will be your curse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words had nestled their venomous life within her, and stirred
      continually the vision of the scene at the Whispering Stones. That scene
      was now like an accusing apparition: she dreaded that Grandcourt should
      know of it&mdash;so far out of her sight now was that possibility she had
      once satisfied herself with, of speaking to him about Mrs. Glasher and her
      children, and making them rich amends. Any endurance seemed easier than
      the mortal humiliation of confessing that she knew all before she married
      him, and in marrying him had broken her word. For the reasons by which she
      had justified herself when the marriage tempted her, and all her easy
      arrangement of her future power over her husband to make him do better
      than he might be inclined to do, were now as futile as the burned-out
      lights which set off a child&rsquo;s pageant. Her sense of being
      blameworthy was exaggerated by a dread both definite and vague. The
      definite dread was lest the veil of secrecy should fall between her and
      Grandcourt, and give him the right to taunt her. With the reading of that
      letter had begun her husband&rsquo;s empire of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      And her husband all the while knew it. He had not, indeed, any distinct
      knowledge of her broken promise, and would not have rated highly the
      effect of that breach on her conscience; but he was aware not only of what
      Lush had told him about the meeting at the Whispering Stones, but also of
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s concealment as to the cause of her sudden illness. He
      felt sure that Lydia had enclosed something with the diamonds, and that
      this something, whatever it was, had at once created in Gwendolen a new
      repulsion for him and a reason for not daring to manifest it. He did not
      greatly mind, or feel as many men might have felt, that his hopes in
      marriage were blighted: he had wanted to marry Gwendolen, and he was not a
      man to repent. Why should a gentleman whose other relations in life are
      carried on without the luxury of sympathetic feeling, be supposed to
      require that kind of condiment in domestic life? What he chiefly felt was
      that a change had come over the conditions of his mastery, which, far from
      shaking it, might establish it the more thoroughly. And it was
      established. He judged that he had not married a simpleton unable to
      perceive the impossibility of escape, or to see alternative evils: he had
      married a girl who had spirit and pride enough not to make a fool of
      herself by forfeiting all the advantages of a position which had attracted
      her; and if she wanted pregnant hints to help her in making up her mind
      properly he would take care not to withhold them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen, indeed, with all that gnawing trouble in her consciousness, had
      hardly for a moment dropped the sense that it was her part to bear herself
      with dignity, and appear what is called happy. In disclosure of
      disappointment or sorrow she saw nothing but a humiliation which would
      have been vinegar to her wounds. Whatever her husband might have come at
      last to be to her, she meant to wear the yoke so as not to be pitied. For
      she did think of the coming years with presentiment: she was frightened at
      Grandcourt. The poor thing had passed from her girlish sauciness of
      superiority over this inert specimen of personal distinction into an
      amazed perception of her former ignorance about the possible mental
      attitude of a man toward the woman he sought in marriage&mdash;of her
      present ignorance as to what their life with each other might turn into.
      For novelty gives immeasurableness to fear, and fills the early time of
      all sad changes with phantoms of the future. Her little coquetries,
      voluntary or involuntary, had told on Grandcourt during courtship, and
      formed a medium of communication between them, showing him in the light of
      a creature such as she could understand and manage: but marriage had
      nullified all such interchange, and Grandcourt had become a blank
      uncertainty to her in everything but this, that he would do just what he
      willed, and that she had neither devices at her command to determine his
      will, nor any rational means of escaping it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had occurred between them and her wearing the diamonds was typical.
      One evening, shortly before they came to the Abbey, they were going to
      dine at Brackenshaw Castle. Gwendolen had said to herself that she would
      never wear those diamonds: they had horrible words clinging and crawling
      about them, as from some bad dream, whose images lingered on the perturbed
      sense. She came down dressed in her white, with only a streak of gold and
      a pendant of emeralds, which Grandcourt had given her, round her neck, and
      the little emerald stars in her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt stood with his back to the fire and looked at her as she
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I altogether as you like?&rdquo; she said, speaking rather
      gaily. She was not without enjoyment in this occasion of going to
      Brackenshaw Castle with her new dignities upon her, as men whose affairs
      are sadly involved will enjoy dining out among persons likely to be under
      a pleasant mistake about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen felt suddenly uncomfortable, wondering what was to come. She was
      not unprepared for some struggle about the diamonds; but suppose he were
      going to say, in low, contemptuous tones, &ldquo;You are not in any way
      what I like.&rdquo; It was very bad for her to be secretly hating him; but
      it would be much worse when he gave the first sign of hating her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mercy!&rdquo; she exclaimed, the pause lasting till she could
      bear it no longer. &ldquo;How am I to alter myself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put on the diamonds,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, looking straight at
      her with his narrow glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen paused in her turn, afraid of showing any emotion, and feeling
      that nevertheless there was some change in her eyes as they met his. But
      she was obliged to answer, and said as indifferently as she could, &ldquo;Oh,
      please not. I don&rsquo;t think diamonds suit me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you think has nothing to do with it,&rdquo; said Grandcourt,
      his <i>sotto voce</i> imperiousness seeming to have an evening quietude
      and finish, like his toilet. &ldquo;I wish you to wear the diamonds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray excuse me; I like these emeralds,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      frightened in spite of her preparation. That white hand of his which was
      touching his whisker was capable, she fancied, of clinging round her neck
      and threatening to throttle her; for her fear of him, mingling with the
      vague foreboding of some retributive calamity which hung about her life,
      had reached a superstitious point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oblige me by telling me your reason for not wearing the diamonds
      when I desire it,&rdquo; said Grandcourt. His eyes were still fixed upon
      her, and she felt her own eyes narrowing under them as if to shut out an
      entering pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of what use was the rebellion within her? She could say nothing that would
      not hurt her worse than submission. Turning slowly and covering herself
      again, she went to her dressing-room. As she reached out the diamonds, it
      occurred to her that her unwillingness to wear them might have already
      raised a suspicion in Grandcourt that she had some knowledge about them
      which he had not given her. She fancied that his eyes showed a delight in
      torturing her. How could she be defiant? She had nothing to say that would
      touch him&mdash;nothing but what would give him a more painful grasp on
      her consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He delights in making the dogs and horses quail: that is half his
      pleasure in calling them his,&rdquo; she said to herself, as she opened
      the jewel-case with a shivering sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will come to be so with me; and I shall quail. What else is
      there for me? I will not say to the world, &lsquo;Pity me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was about to ring for her maid when she heard the door open behind
      her. It was Grandcourt who came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want some one to fasten them,&rdquo; he said, coming toward
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, but simply stood still, leaving him to take out the
      ornaments and fasten them as he would. Doubtless he had been used to
      fasten them on some one else. With a bitter sort of sarcasm against
      herself, Gwendolen thought, &ldquo;What a privilege this is, to have
      robbed another woman of!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you so cold?&rdquo; said Grandcourt, when he had
      fastened the last ear-ring. &ldquo;Pray put plenty of furs on. I hate to
      see a woman come into a room looking frozen. If you are to appear as a
      bride at all, appear decently.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This marital speech was not exactly persuasive, but it touched the quick
      of Gwendolen&rsquo;s pride and forced her to rally. The words of the bad
      dream crawled about the diamonds still, but only for her: to others they
      were brilliants that suited her perfectly, and Grandcourt inwardly
      observed that she answered to the rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, mamma, quite happy,&rdquo; Gwendolen had said on her
      return to Diplow. &ldquo;Not at all disappointed in Ryelands. It is a much
      finer place than this&mdash;larger in every way. But don&rsquo;t you want
      some more money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not know that Mr. Grandcourt left me a letter on your
      wedding-day? I am to have eight hundred a year. He wishes me to keep
      Offendene for the present, while you are at Diplow. But if there were some
      pretty cottage near the park at Ryelands we might live there without much
      expense, and I should have you most of the year, perhaps.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must leave that to Mr. Grandcourt, mamma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly. It is exceedingly handsome of him to say that he
      will pay the rent for Offendene till June. And we can go on very well&mdash;without
      any man-servant except Crane, just for out-of-doors. Our good Merry will
      stay with us and help me to manage everything. It is natural that Mr.
      Grandcourt should wish me to live in a good style of house in your
      neighborhood, and I cannot decline. So he said nothing about it to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he wished me to hear it from you, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen in fact had been very anxious to have some definite knowledge of
      what would be done for her mother, but at no moment since her marriage had
      she been able to overcome the difficulty of mentioning the subject to
      Grandcourt. Now, however, she had a sense of obligation which would not
      let her rest without saying to him, &ldquo;It is very good of you to
      provide for mamma. You took a great deal on yourself in marrying a girl
      who had nothing but relations belonging to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt was smoking, and only said carelessly, &ldquo;Of course I was
      not going to let her live like a gamekeeper&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least he is not mean about money,&rdquo; thought Gwendolen,
      &ldquo;and mamma is the better off for my marriage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She often pursued the comparison between what might have been, if she had
      not married Grandcourt, and what actually was, trying to persuade herself
      that life generally was barren of satisfaction, and that if she had chosen
      differently she might now have been looking back with a regret as bitter
      as the feeling she was trying to argue away. Her mother&rsquo;s dullness,
      which used to irritate her, she was at present inclined to explain as the
      ordinary result of woman&rsquo;s experience. True, she still saw that she
      would &ldquo;manage differently from mamma;&rdquo; but her management now
      only meant that she would carry her troubles with spirit, and let none
      suspect them. By and by she promised herself that she should get used to
      her heart-sores, and find excitements that would carry her through life,
      as a hard gallop carried her through some of the morning hours. There was
      gambling: she had heard stories at Leubronn of fashionable women who
      gambled in all sorts of ways. It seemed very flat to her at this distance,
      but perhaps if she began to gamble again, the passion might awake. Then
      there was the pleasure of producing an effect by her appearance in
      society: what did celebrated beauties do in town when their husbands could
      afford display? All men were fascinated by them: they had a perfect
      equipage and toilet, walked into public places, and bowed, and made the
      usual answers, and walked out again, perhaps they bought china, and
      practiced accomplishments. If she could only feel a keen appetite for
      those pleasures&mdash;could only believe in pleasure as she used to do!
      Accomplishments had ceased to have the exciting quality of promising any
      pre-eminence to her; and as for fascinated gentlemen&mdash;adorers who
      might hover round her with languishment, and diversify married life with
      the romantic stir of mystery, passion, and danger, which her French
      reading had given her some girlish notion of&mdash;they presented
      themselves to her imagination with the fatal circumstance that, instead of
      fascinating her in return, they were clad in her own weariness and
      disgust. The admiring male, rashly adjusting the expression of his
      features and the turn of his conversation to her supposed tastes, had
      always been an absurd object to her, and at present seemed rather
      detestable. Many courses are actually pursued&mdash;follies and sins both
      convenient and inconvenient&mdash;without pleasure or hope of pleasure;
      but to solace ourselves with imagining any course beforehand, there must
      be some foretaste of pleasure in the shape of appetite; and Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      appetite had sickened. Let her wander over the possibilities of her life
      as she would, an uncertain shadow dogged her. Her confidence in herself
      and her destiny had turned into remorse and dread; she trusted neither
      herself nor her future.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hidden helplessness gave fresh force to the hold Deronda had from the
      first taken on her mind, as one who had an unknown standard by which he
      judged her. Had he some way of looking at things which might be a new
      footing for her&mdash;an inward safeguard against possible events which
      she dreaded as stored-up retribution? It is one of the secrets in that
      change of mental poise which has been fitly named conversion, that to many
      among us neither heaven nor earth has any revelation till some personality
      touches theirs with a peculiar influence, subduing them into
      receptiveness. It had been Gwendolen&rsquo;s habit to think of the persons
      around her as stale books, too familiar to be interesting. Deronda had lit
      up her attention with a sense of novelty: not by words only, but by
      imagined facts, his influence had entered into the current of that
      self-suspicion and self-blame which awakens a new consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he could know everything about me without my telling him,&rdquo;
      was one of her thoughts, as she sat leaning over the end of a couch,
      supporting her head with her hand, and looking at herself in a mirror&mdash;not
      in admiration, but in a sad kind of companionship. &ldquo;I wish he knew
      that I am not so contemptible as he thinks me; that I am in deep trouble,
      and want to be something better if I could.&rdquo; Without the aid of
      sacred ceremony or costume, her feelings had turned this man, only a few
      years older than herself, into a priest; a sort of trust less rare than
      the fidelity that guards it. Young reverence for one who is also young is
      the most coercive of all: there is the same level of temptation, and the
      higher motive is believed in as a fuller force&mdash;not suspected to be a
      mere residue from weary experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the coercion is often stronger on the one who takes the reverence.
      Those who trust us educate us. And perhaps in that ideal consecration of
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s, some education was being prepared for Deronda.

  Et je sçais mesme sur ce fait
  Bon nombre d&rsquo;hommes qui sont femmes.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Meanwhile Deronda had been fastened and led off by Mr. Vandernoodt, who
      wished for a brisker walk, a cigar, and a little gossip. Since we cannot
      tell a man his own secrets, the restraint of being in his company often
      breeds a desire to pair off in conversation with some more ignorant
      person, and Mr. Vandernoodt presently said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a washed-out piece of cambric Grandcourt is! But if he is a
      favorite of yours, I withdraw the remark.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least in the world,&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought not. One wonders how he came to have a great passion
      again; and he must have had&mdash;to marry in this way. Though Lush, his
      old chum, hints that he married this girl out of obstinacy. By George! it
      was a very accountable obstinacy. A man might make up his mind to marry
      her without the stimulus of contradiction. But he must have made himself a
      pretty large drain of money, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of his affairs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! not of the other establishment he keeps up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diplow? Of course. He took that of Sir Hugo. But merely for the
      year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; not Diplow: Gadsmere. Sir Hugo knows, I&rsquo;ll answer for
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda said nothing. He really began to feel some curiosity, but he
      foresaw that he should hear what Mr. Vandernoodt had to tell, without the
      condescension of asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lush would not altogether own to it, of course. He&rsquo;s a
      confident and go-between of Grandcourt&rsquo;s. But I have it on the best
      authority. The fact is, there&rsquo;s another lady with four children at
      Gadsmere. She has had the upper hand of him these ten years and more, and
      by what I can understand has it still&mdash;left her husband for him, and
      used to travel with him everywhere. Her husband&rsquo;s dead now; I found
      a fellow who was in the same regiment with him, and knew this Mrs. Glasher
      before she took wing. A fiery dark-eyed woman&mdash;a noted beauty at that
      time&mdash;he thought she was dead. They say she has Grandcourt under her
      thumb still, and it&rsquo;s a wonder he didn&rsquo;t marry her, for there&rsquo;s
      a very fine boy, and I understand Grandcourt can do absolutely as he
      pleases with the estates. Lush told me as much as that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right had he to marry this girl?&rdquo; said Deronda, with
      disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Vandernoodt, adjusting the end of his cigar, shrugged his shoulders
      and put out his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>She</i> can know nothing of it,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      emphatically. But that positive statement was immediately followed by an
      inward query&mdash;&ldquo;Could she have known anything of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a piquant picture,&rdquo; said Mr. Vandernoodt&mdash;&ldquo;Grandcourt
      between two fiery women. For depend upon it this light-haired one has
      plenty of devil in her. I formed that opinion of her at Leubronn. It&rsquo;s
      a sort of Medea and Creüsa business. Fancy the two meeting! Grandcourt is
      a new kind of Jason: I wonder what sort of a part he&rsquo;ll make of it.
      It&rsquo;s a dog&rsquo;s part at best. I think I hear Ristori now, saying,
      &lsquo;Jasone! Jasone!&rsquo; These fine women generally get hold of a
      stick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandcourt can bite, I fancy,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;He is no
      stick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I meant Jason. I can&rsquo;t quite make out Grandcourt. But
      he&rsquo;s a keen fellow enough&mdash;uncommonly well built too. And if he
      comes into all this property, the estates will bear dividing. This girl,
      whose friends had come to beggary, I understand, may think herself lucky
      to get him. I don&rsquo;t want to be hard on a man because he gets
      involved in an affair of that sort. But he might make himself more
      agreeable. I was telling him a capital story last night, and he got up and
      walked away in the middle. I felt inclined to kick him. Do you suppose
      that is inattention or insolence, now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a mixture. He generally observes the forms: but he doesn&rsquo;t
      listen much,&rdquo; said Deronda. Then, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, he
      went on, &ldquo;I should think there must be some exaggeration or
      inaccuracy in what you have heard about this lady at Gadsmere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit, depend upon it; it has all lain snug of late years.
      People have forgotten all about it. But there the nest is, and the birds
      are in it. And I know Grandcourt goes there. I have good evidence that he
      goes there. However, that&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s business but his own. The
      affair has sunk below the surface.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you could have learned so much about it,&rdquo; said
      Deronda, rather drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there are plenty of people who knew all about it; but such
      stories get packed away like old letters. They interest me. I like to know
      the manners of my time&mdash;contemporary gossip, not antediluvian. These
      Dryasdust fellows get a reputation by raking up some small scandal about
      Semiramis or Nitocris, and then we have a thousand and one poems written
      upon it by all the warblers big and little. But I don&rsquo;t care a straw
      about the <i>faux pas</i> of the mummies. You do, though. You are one of
      the historical men&mdash;more interested in a lady when she&rsquo;s got a
      rag face and skeleton toes peeping out. Does that flatter your
      imagination?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if she had any woes in her love, one has the satisfaction of
      knowing that she&rsquo;s well out of them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are thinking of the Medea, I see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda then chose to point to some giant oaks worth looking at in their
      bareness. He also felt an interest in this piece of contemporary gossip,
      but he was satisfied that Mr. Vandernoodt had no more to tell about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the early days when he tried to construct the hidden story of his
      own birth, his mind had perhaps never been so active in weaving
      probabilities about any private affair as it had now begun to be about
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s marriage. This unavowed relation of Grandcourt&rsquo;s&mdash;could
      she have gained some knowledge of it, which caused her to shrink from the
      match&mdash;a shrinking finally overcome by the urgence of poverty? He
      could recall almost every word she had said to him, and in certain of
      these words he seemed to discern that she was conscious of having done
      some wrong&mdash;inflicted some injury. His own acute experience made him
      alive to the form of injury which might affect the unavowed children and
      their mother. Was Mrs. Grandcourt, under all her determined show of
      satisfaction, gnawed by a double, a treble-headed grief&mdash;self-reproach,
      disappointment, jealousy? He dwelt especially on all the slight signs of
      self-reproach: he was inclined to judge her tenderly, to excuse, to pity.
      He thought he had found a key now by which to interpret her more clearly:
      what magnifying of her misery might not a young creature get into who had
      wedded her fresh hopes to old secrets! He thought he saw clearly enough
      now why Sir Hugo had never dropped any hint of this affair to him; and
      immediately the image of this Mrs. Glasher became painfully associated
      with his own hidden birth. Gwendolen knowing of that woman and her
      children, marrying Grandcourt, and showing herself contented, would have
      been among the most repulsive of beings to him; but Gwendolen tasting the
      bitterness of remorse for having contributed to their injury was brought
      very near to his fellow-feeling. If it were so, she had got to a common
      plane of understanding with him on some difficulties of life which a woman
      is rarely able to judge of with any justice or generosity; for, according
      to precedent, Gwendolen&rsquo;s view of her position might easily have
      been no other than that her husband&rsquo;s marriage with her was his
      entrance on the path of virtue, while Mrs. Glasher represented his
      forsaken sin. And Deronda had naturally some resentment on behalf of the
      Hagars and Ishmaels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undeniably Deronda&rsquo;s growing solicitude about Gwendolen depended
      chiefly on her peculiar manner toward him; and I suppose neither man nor
      woman would be the better for an utter insensibility to such appeals. One
      sign that his interest in her had changed its footing was that he
      dismissed any caution against her being a coquette setting snares to
      involve him in a vulgar flirtation, and determined that he would not again
      evade any opportunity of talking to her. He had shaken off Mr.
      Vandernoodt, and got into a solitary corner in the twilight; but half an
      hour was long enough to think of those possibilities in Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      position and state of mind; and on forming the determination not to avoid
      her, he remembered that she was likely to be at tea with the other ladies
      in the drawing-room. The conjecture was true; for Gwendolen, after
      resolving not to go down again for the next four hours, began to feel, at
      the end of one, that in shutting herself up she missed all chances of
      seeing and hearing, and that her visit would only last two days more. She
      adjusted herself, put on her little air of self-possession, and going
      down, made herself resolutely agreeable. Only ladies were assembled, and
      Lady Pentreath was amusing them with a description of a drawing-room under
      the Regency, and the figure that was cut by ladies and gentlemen in 1819,
      the year she was presented&mdash;when Deronda entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I be acceptable?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps I had better
      go back and look for the others. I suppose they are in the billiard-room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; stay where you are,&rdquo; said Lady Pentreath. &ldquo;They
      were all getting tired of me; let us hear what <i>you</i> have to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is rather an embarrassing appeal,&rdquo; said Deronda, drawing
      up a chair near Lady Mallinger&rsquo;s elbow at the tea-table. &ldquo;I
      think I had better take the opportunity of mentioning our songstress,&rdquo;
      he added, looking at Lady Mallinger&mdash;&ldquo;unless you have done so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the little Jewess!&rdquo; said Lady Mallinger. &ldquo;No, I
      have not mentioned her. It never entered my head that any one here wanted
      singing lessons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ladies know some one else who wants singing lessons,&rdquo;
      said Deronda. &ldquo;I have happened to find an exquisite singer,&rdquo;&mdash;here
      he turned to Lady Pentreath. &ldquo;She is living with some ladies who are
      friends of mine&mdash;the mother and sisters of a man who was my chum at
      Cambridge. She was on the stage at Vienna; but she wants to leave that
      life, and maintain herself by teaching.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are swarms of those people, aren&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; said
      the old lady. &ldquo;Are her lessons to be very cheap or very expensive?
      Those are the two baits I know of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another bait for those who hear her,&rdquo; said Deronda.
      &ldquo;Her singing is something quite exceptional, I think. She has had
      such first-rate teaching&mdash;or rather first-rate instinct with her
      teaching&mdash;that you might imagine her singing all came by nature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did she leave the stage, then?&rdquo; said Lady Pentreath.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too old to believe in first-rate people giving up
      first-rate chances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her voice was too weak. It is a delicious voice for a room. You who
      put up with my singing of Schubert would be enchanted with hers,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, looking at Mrs. Raymond. &ldquo;And I imagine she would not
      object to sing at private parties or concerts. Her voice is quite equal to
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to have her in my drawing-room when we go up to town,&rdquo;
      said Lady Mallinger. &ldquo;You shall hear her then. I have not heard her
      myself yet; but I trust Daniel&rsquo;s recommendation. I mean my girls to
      have lessons of her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a charitable affair?&rdquo; said Lady Pentreath. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      bear charitable music.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Mallinger, who was rather helpless in conversation, and felt herself
      under an engagement not to tell anything of Mirah&rsquo;s story, had an
      embarrassed smile on her face, and glanced at Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a charity to those who want to have a good model of feminine
      singing,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;I think everybody who has ears would
      benefit by a little improvement on the ordinary style. If you heard Miss
      Lapidoth&rdquo;&mdash;here he looked at Gwendolen&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps you
      would revoke your resolution to give up singing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should rather think my resolution would be confirmed,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel able to follow your advice of
      enjoying my own middlingness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Deronda, &ldquo;people who do anything
      finely always inspirit me to try. I don&rsquo;t mean that they make me
      believe I can do it as well. But they make the thing, whatever it may be,
      seem worthy to be done. I can bear to think my own music not good for
      much, but the world would be more dismal if I thought music itself not
      good for much. Excellence encourages one about life generally; it shows
      the spiritual wealth of the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, if we can&rsquo;t imitate it, it only makes our own life
      seem the tamer,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, in a mood to resent encouragement
      founded on her own insignificance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on the point of view, I think,&rdquo; said Deronda.
      &ldquo;We should have a poor life of it if we were reduced for all our
      pleasure to our own performances. A little private imitation of what is
      good is a sort of private devotion to it, and most of us ought to practice
      art only in the light of private study&mdash;preparation to understand and
      enjoy what the few can do for us. I think Miss Lapidoth is one of the few.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be a very happy person, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, with a touch of sarcasm, and a turn of her neck toward Mrs.
      Raymond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the independent lady; &ldquo;I
      must hear more of her before I say that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may have been a bitter disappointment to her that her voice
      failed her for the stage,&rdquo; said Juliet Fenn, sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she&rsquo;s past her best, though,&rdquo; said the deep
      voice of Lady Pentreath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, she has not reached it,&rdquo; said Deronda.
      &ldquo;She is barely twenty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And very pretty,&rdquo; interposed Lady Mallinger, with an amiable
      wish to help Deronda. &ldquo;And she has very good manners. I&rsquo;m
      sorry she&rsquo;s a bigoted Jewess; I should not like it for anything
      else, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter in singing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since her voice is too weak for her to scream much, I&rsquo;ll
      tell Lady Clementina to set her on my nine granddaughters,&rdquo; said
      Lady Pentreath; &ldquo;and I hope she&rsquo;ll convince eight of them that
      they have not voice enough to sing anywhere but at church. My notion is,
      that many of our girls nowadays want lessons not to sing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had my lessons in that,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, looking at
      Deronda. &ldquo;You see Lady Pentreath is on my side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was speaking, Sir Hugo entered with some of the other gentlemen,
      including Grandcourt, and standing against the group at the low tea-table
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What imposition is Deronda putting on you, ladies&mdash;slipping in
      among you by himself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanting to pass off an obscurity on us as better than any
      celebrity,&rdquo; said Lady Pentreath&mdash;&ldquo;a pretty singing Jewess
      who is to astonish these young people. You and I, who heard Catalani in
      her prime, are not so easily astonished.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Hugo listened with his good-humored smile as he took a cup of tea from
      his wife, and then said, &ldquo;Well, you know, a Liberal is bound to
      think that there have been singers since Catalani&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are younger than I am. I dare say you are one of the men
      who ran after Alcharisi. But she married off and left you all in the
      lurch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; it&rsquo;s rather too bad when these great singers marry
      themselves into silence before they have a crack in their voices. And the
      husband is a public robber. I remember Leroux saying, &lsquo;A man might
      as well take down a fine peal of church bells and carry them off to the
      steppes,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, setting down his cup and turning away,
      while Deronda, who had moved from his place to make room for others, and
      felt that he was not in request, sat down a little apart. Presently he
      became aware that, in the general dispersion of the group, Gwendolen had
      extricated herself from the attentions of Mr. Vandernoodt and had walked
      to the piano, where she stood apparently examining the music which lay on
      the desk. Will any one be surprised at Deronda&rsquo;s concluding that she
      wished him to join her? Perhaps she wanted to make amends for the
      unpleasant tone of resistance with which she had met his recommendation of
      Mirah, for he had noticed that her first impulse often was to say what she
      afterward wished to retract. He went to her side and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you relenting about the music and looking for something to play
      or sing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not looking for anything, but I <i>am</i> relenting,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, speaking in a submissive tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I know the reason?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to hear Miss Lapidoth and have lessons from her,
      since you admire her so much&mdash;that is, of course, when we go to town.
      I mean lessons in rejoicing at her excellence and my own deficiency,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, turning on him a sweet, open smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be really glad for you to see and hear her,&rdquo; said
      Deronda, returning the smile in kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she as perfect in every thing else as in her music?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t vouch for that exactly. I have not seen enough of
      her. But I have seen nothing in her that I could wish to be different. She
      has had an unhappy life. Her troubles began in early childhood, and she
      has grown up among very painful surroundings. But I think you will say
      that no advantages could have given her more grace and truer refinement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what sort of trouble hers were?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not any very precise knowledge. But I know that she was on
      the brink of drowning herself in despair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what hindered her?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, quickly, looking at
      Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some ray or other came&mdash;which made her feel that she ought to
      live&mdash;that it was good to live,&rdquo; he answered, quietly. &ldquo;She
      is full of piety, and seems capable of submitting to anything when it
      takes the form of duty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those people are not to be pitied,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      impatiently. &ldquo;I have no sympathy with women who are always doing
      right. I don&rsquo;t believe in their great sufferings.&rdquo; Her fingers
      moved quickly among the edges of the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Deronda, &ldquo;that the consciousness of
      having done wrong is something deeper, more bitter. I suppose we faulty
      creatures can never feel so much for the irreproachable as for those who
      are bruised in the struggle with their own faults. It is a very ancient
      story, that of the lost sheep&mdash;but it comes up afresh every day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a way of speaking&mdash;it is not acted upon, it is not
      real,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, bitterly. &ldquo;You admire Miss Lapidoth
      because you think her blameless, perfect. And you know you would despise a
      woman who had done something you thought very wrong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would depend entirely upon her own view of what she had done,&rdquo;
      said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be satisfied if she were very wretched, I suppose,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not satisfied&mdash;full of sorrow for her. It was not a mere
      way of speaking. I did not mean to say that the finer nature is not more
      adorable; I meant that those who would be comparatively uninteresting
      beforehand may become worthier of sympathy when they do something that
      awakens in them a keen remorse. Lives are enlarged in different ways. I
      dare say some would never get their eyes opened if it were not for a
      violent shock from the consequences of their own actions. And when they
      are suffering in that way one must care for them more than for the
      comfortably self-satisfied.&rdquo; Deronda forgot everything but his
      vision of what Gwendolen&rsquo;s experience had probably been, and urged
      by compassion let his eyes and voice express as much interest as they
      would.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen had slipped on to the music-stool, and looked up at him with
      pain in her long eyes, like a wounded animal asking for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you persuading Mrs. Grandcourt to play to us, Dan?&rdquo; said
      Sir Hugo, coming up and putting his hand on Deronda&rsquo;s shoulder with
      a gentle, admonitory pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot persuade myself,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others had followed Sir Hugo&rsquo;s lead, and there was an end of any
      liability to confidences for that day. But the next was New Year&rsquo;s
      Eve; and a grand dance, to which the chief tenants were invited, was to be
      held in the picture-gallery above the cloister&mdash;the sort of
      entertainment in which numbers and general movement may create privacy.
      When Gwendolen was dressing, she longed, in remembrance of Leubronn, to
      put on the old turquoise necklace for her sole ornament; but she dared not
      offend her husband by appearing in that shabby way on an occasion when he
      would demand her utmost splendor. Determined to wear the memorial necklace
      somehow, she wound it thrice round her wrist and made a bracelet of it&mdash;having
      gone to her room to put it on just before the time of entering the
      ball-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was always a beautiful scene, this dance on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, which
      had been kept up by the family tradition as nearly in the old fashion as
      inexorable change would allow. Red carpet was laid down for the occasion:
      hot-house plants and evergreens were arranged in bowers at the extremities
      and in every recess of the gallery; and the old portraits stretching back
      through generations, even to the pre-portraying period, made a piquant
      line of spectators. Some neighboring gentry, major and minor, were
      invited; and it was certainly an occasion when a prospective master and
      mistress of Abbott&rsquo;s and King&rsquo;s Topping might see their future
      glory in an agreeable light, as a picturesque provincial supremacy with a
      rent-roll personified by the most prosperous-looking tenants. Sir Hugo
      expected Grandcourt to feel flattered by being asked to the Abbey at a
      time which included this festival in honor of the family estate; but he
      also hoped that his own hale appearance might impress his successor with
      the probable length of time that would elapse before the succession came,
      and with the wisdom of preferring a good actual sum to a minor property
      that must be waited for. All present, down to the least important farmer&rsquo;s
      daughter, knew that they were to see &ldquo;young Grandcourt,&rdquo; Sir
      Hugo&rsquo;s nephew, the presumptive heir and future baronet, now visiting
      the Abbey with his bride after an absence of many years; any coolness
      between uncle and nephew having, it is understood, given way to a friendly
      warmth. The bride opening the ball with Sir Hugo was necessarily the
      cynosure of all eyes; and less than a year before, if some magic mirror
      could have shown Gwendolen her actual position, she would have imagined
      herself moving in it with a glow of triumphant pleasure, conscious that
      she held in her hands a life full of favorable chances which her
      cleverness and spirit would enable her to make the best of. And now she
      was wondering that she could get so little joy out of the exultation to
      which she had been suddenly lifted, away from the distasteful petty empire
      of her girlhood with its irksome lack of distinction and superfluity of
      sisters. She would have been glad to be even unreasonably elated, and to
      forget everything but the flattery of the moment; but she was like one
      courting sleep, in whom thoughts insist like willful tormentors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wondering in this way at her own dullness, and all the while longing for
      an excitement that would deaden importunate aches, she was passing through
      files of admiring beholders in the country-dance with which it was
      traditional to open the ball, and was being generally regarded by her own
      sex as an enviable woman. It was remarked that she carried herself with a
      wonderful air, considering that she had been nobody in particular, and
      without a farthing to her fortune. If she had been a duke&rsquo;s
      daughter, or one of the royal princesses, she could not have taken the
      honors of the evening more as a matter of course. Poor Gwendolen! It would
      by-and-by become a sort of skill in which she was automatically practiced
      to bear this last great gambling loss with an air of perfect
      self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next couple that passed were also worth looking at. Lady Pentreath had
      said, &ldquo;I shall stand up for one dance, but I shall choose my
      partner. Mr. Deronda, you are the youngest man, I mean to dance with you.
      Nobody is old enough to make a good pair with me. I must have a contrast.&rdquo;
      And the contrast certainly set off the old lady to the utmost. She was one
      of those women who are never handsome till they are old, and she had had
      the wisdom to embrace the beauty of age as early as possible. What might
      have seemed harshness in her features when she was young, had turned now
      into a satisfactory strength of form and expression which defied wrinkles,
      and was set off by a crown of white hair; her well-built figure was well
      covered with black drapery, her ears and neck comfortably caressed with
      lace, showing none of those withered spaces which one would think it a
      pitiable condition of poverty to expose. She glided along gracefully
      enough, her dark eyes still with a mischievous smile in them as she
      observed the company. Her partner&rsquo;s young richness of tint against
      the flattened hues and rougher forms of her aged head had an effect
      something like that of a fine flower against a lichenous branch. Perhaps
      the tenants hardly appreciated this pair. Lady Pentreath was nothing more
      than a straight, active old lady: Mr. Deronda was a familiar figure
      regarded with friendliness; but if he had been the heir, it would have
      been regretted that his face was not as unmistakably English as Sir Hugo&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s appearance when he came up with Lady Mallinger was not
      impeached with foreignness: still the satisfaction in it was not complete.
      It would have been matter of congratulation if one who had the luck to
      inherit two old family estates had had more hair, a fresher color, and a
      look of greater animation; but that fine families dwindled off into
      females, and estates ran together into the single heirship of a
      mealy-complexioned male, was a tendency in things which seemed to be
      accounted for by a citation of other instances. It was agreed that Mr.
      Grandcourt could never be taken for anything but what he was&mdash;a born
      gentleman; and that, in fact, he looked like an heir. Perhaps the person
      least complacently disposed toward him at that moment was Lady Mallinger,
      to whom going in procession up this country-dance with Grandcourt was a
      blazonment of herself as the infelicitous wife who had produced nothing
      but daughters, little better than no children, poor dear things, except
      for her own fondness and for Sir Hugo&rsquo;s wonderful goodness to them.
      But such inward discomfort could not prevent the gentle lady from looking
      fair and stout to admiration, or her full blue eyes from glancing mildly
      at her neighbors. All the mothers and fathers held it a thousand pities
      that she had not had a fine boy, or even several&mdash;which might have
      been expected, to look at her when she was first married.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gallery included only three sides of the quadrangle, the fourth being
      shut off as a lobby or corridor: one side was used for dancing, and the
      opposite side for the supper-table, while the intermediate part was less
      brilliantly lit, and fitted with comfortable seats. Later in the evening
      Gwendolen was in one of these seats, and Grandcourt was standing near her.
      They were not talking to each other: she was leaning backward in her
      chair, and he against the wall; and Deronda, happening to observe this,
      went up to ask her if she had resolved not to dance any more. Having
      himself been doing hard duty in this way among the guests, he thought he
      had earned the right to sink for a little while into the background, and
      he had spoken little to Gwendolen since their conversation at the piano
      the day before. Grandcourt&rsquo;s presence would only make it the easier
      to show that pleasure in talking to her even about trivialities which
      would be a sign of friendliness; and he fancied that her face looked
      blank. A smile beamed over it as she saw him coming, and she raised
      herself from her leaning posture. Grandcourt had been grumbling at the <i>ennui</i>
      of staying so long in this stupid dance, and proposing that they should
      vanish: she had resisted on the ground of politeness&mdash;not without
      being a little frightened at the probability that he was silently angry
      with her. She had her reason for staying, though she had begun to despair
      of the opportunity for the sake of which she had put the old necklace on
      her wrist. But now at last Deronda had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I shall not dance any more. Are you not glad?&rdquo; she said,
      with some gayety, &ldquo;you might have felt obliged humbly to offer
      yourself as a partner, and I feel sure you have danced more than you like
      already.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not deny that,&rdquo; said Deronda, &ldquo;since you have
      danced as much as you like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will you take trouble for me in another way, and fetch me a
      glass of that fresh water?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but a few steps that Deronda had to go for the water. Gwendolen was
      wrapped in the lightest, softest of white woolen burnouses, under which
      her hands were hidden. While he was gone she had drawn off her glove,
      which was finished with a lace ruffle, and when she put up her hand to
      take the glass and lifted it to her mouth, the necklace-bracelet, which in
      its triple winding adapted itself clumsily to her wrist, was necessarily
      conspicuous. Grandcourt saw it, and saw that it was attracting Deronda&rsquo;s
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that hideous thing you have got on your wrist?&rdquo; said
      the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, composedly, pointing to the
      turquoises, while she still held the glass; &ldquo;it is an old necklace I
      like to wear. I lost it once, and someone found it for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that she gave the glass again to Deronda, who immediately carried it
      away, and on returning said, in order to banish any consciousness about
      the necklace,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is worth while for you to go and look out at one of the windows
      on that side. You can see the finest possible moonlight on the stone
      pillars and carving, and shadows waving across it in the wind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see it. Will you go?&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      looking up at her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast his eyes down at her, and saying, &ldquo;No, Deronda will take
      you,&rdquo; slowly moved from his leaning attitude, and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s face for a moment showed a fleeting vexation: she
      resented this show of indifference toward her. Deronda felt annoyed,
      chiefly for her sake; and with a quick sense, that it would relieve her
      most to behave as if nothing peculiar had occurred, he said, &ldquo;Will
      you take my arm and go, while only servants are there?&rdquo; He thought
      that he understood well her action in drawing his attention to the
      necklace: she wished him to infer that she had submitted her mind to
      rebuke&mdash;her speech and manner had from the first fluctuated toward
      that submission&mdash;and that she felt no lingering resentment. Her
      evident confidence in his interpretation of her appealed to him as a
      peculiar claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were walking together, Gwendolen felt as if the annoyance which
      had just happened had removed another film of reserve from between them,
      and she had more right than before to be as open as she wished. She did
      not speak, being filled with the sense of silent confidence, until they
      were in front of the window looking out on the moonlit court. A sort of
      bower had been made round the window, turning it into a recess. Quitting
      his arm, she folded her hands in her burnous, and pressed her brow against
      the glass. He moved slightly away, and held the lapels of his coat with
      his thumbs under the collar as his manner was: he had a wonderful power of
      standing perfectly still, and in that position reminded one sometimes of
      Dante&rsquo;s <i>spiriti magni con occhi tardi e gravi</i>. (Doubtless
      some of these danced in their youth, doubted of their own vocation, and
      found their own times too modern.) He abstained from remarking on the
      scene before them, fearing that any indifferent words might jar on her:
      already the calm light and shadow, the ancient steadfast forms, and
      aloofness enough from those inward troubles which he felt sure were
      agitating her. And he judged aright: she would have been impatient of
      polite conversation. The incidents of the last minute or two had receded
      behind former thoughts which she had imagined herself uttering to Deronda,
      which now urged themselves to her lips. In a subdued voice, she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I had gambled again, and lost the necklace again, what
      should you have thought of me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than I do now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are mistaken about me. You wanted me not to do that&mdash;not
      to make my gain out of another&rsquo;s loss in that way&mdash;and I have
      done a great deal worse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine temptations,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;Perhaps
      I am able to understand what you mean. At least I understand
      self-reproach.&rdquo; In spite of preparation he was almost alarmed at
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s precipitancy of confidence toward him, in contrast with
      her habitual resolute concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should you do if you were like me&mdash;feeling that you were
      wrong and miserable, and dreading everything to come?&rdquo; It seemed
      that she was hurrying to make the utmost use of this opportunity to speak
      as she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not to be amended by doing one thing only&mdash;but many,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, hastily, moving her brow from the
      glass and looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked full at her in return, with what she thought was severity. He
      felt that it was not a moment in which he must let himself be tender, and
      flinch from implying a hard opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean there are many thoughts and habits that may help us to bear
      inevitable sorrow. Multitudes have to bear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her brow to the window again, and said impatiently, &ldquo;You
      must tell me then what to think and what to do; else why did you not let
      me go on doing as I liked and not minding? If I had gone on gambling I
      might have won again, and I might have got not to care for anything else.
      You would not let me do that. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I do as I like, and not
      mind? Other people do.&rdquo; Poor Gwendolen&rsquo;s speech expressed
      nothing very clearly except her irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you would ever get not to mind,&rdquo; said
      Deronda, with deep-toned decision. &ldquo;If it were true that baseness
      and cruelty made an escape from pain, what difference would that make to
      people who can&rsquo;t be quite base or cruel? Idiots escape some pain;
      but you can&rsquo;t be an idiot. Some may do wrong to another without
      remorse; but suppose one does feel remorse? I believe you could never lead
      an injurious life&mdash;all reckless lives are injurious, pestilential&mdash;without
      feeling remorse.&rdquo; Deronda&rsquo;s unconscious fervor had gathered as
      he went on: he was uttering thoughts which he had used for himself in
      moments of painful meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell me what better I can do,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      insistently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many things. Look on other lives besides your own. See what their
      troubles are, and how they are borne. Try to care about something in this
      vast world besides the gratification of small selfish desires. Try to care
      for what is best in thought and action&mdash;something that is good apart
      from the accidents of your own lot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant or two Gwendolen was mute. Then, again moving her brow from
      the glass, she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that I am selfish and ignorant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He met her fixed look in silence before he answered firmly&mdash;&ldquo;You
      will not go on being selfish and ignorant!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not turn away her glance or let her eyelids fall, but a change
      came over her face&mdash;that subtle change in nerve and muscle which will
      sometimes give a childlike expression even to the elderly: it is the
      subsidence of self-assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I lead you back?&rdquo; said Deronda, gently, turning and
      offering her his arm again. She took it silently, and in that way they
      came in sight of Grandcourt, who was walking slowly near their former
      place. Gwendolen went up to him and said, &ldquo;I am ready to go now. Mr.
      Deronda will excuse us to Lady Mallinger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;Lord and Lady Pentreath
      disappeared some time ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt gave his arm in silent compliance, nodding over his shoulder to
      Deronda, and Gwendolen too only half turned to bow and say, &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;
      The husband and wife left the gallery and paced the corridors in silence.
      When the door had closed on them in the boudoir, Grandcourt threw himself
      into a chair and said, with undertoned peremptoriness, &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;
      She, already in the expectation of something unpleasant, had thrown off
      her burnous with nervous unconsciousness, and immediately obeyed. Turning
      his eyes toward her, he began,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oblige me in future by not showing whims like a mad woman in a
      play.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there is some understanding between you and Deronda about
      that thing you have on your wrist. If you have anything to say to him, say
      it. But don&rsquo;t carry on a telegraphing which other people are
      supposed not to see. It&rsquo;s damnably vulgar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can know all about the necklace,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, her
      angry pride resisting the nightmare of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know. Keep to yourself whatever you like.&rdquo;
      Grandcourt paused between each sentence, and in each his speech seemed to
      become more preternaturally distinct in its inward tones. &ldquo;What I
      care to know I shall know without your telling me. Only you will please to
      behave as becomes my wife. And not make a spectacle of yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you object to my talking to Mr. Deronda?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care two straws about Deronda, or any other conceited
      hanger-on. You may talk to him as much as you like. He is not going to
      take my place. You are my wife. And you will either fill your place
      properly&mdash;to the world and to me&mdash;or you will go to the devil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never intended anything but to fill my place properly,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, with bitterest mortification in her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put that thing on your wrist, and hid it from me till you
      wanted him to see it. Only fools go into that deaf and dumb talk, and
      think they&rsquo;re secret. You will understand that you are not to
      compromise yourself. Behave with dignity. That&rsquo;s all I have to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that last word Grandcourt rose, turned his back to the fire and
      looked down on her. She was mute. There was no reproach that she dared to
      fling back at him in return for these insulting admonitions, and the very
      reason she felt them to be insulting was that their purport went with the
      most absolute dictate of her pride. What she would least like to incur was
      the making a fool of herself and being compromised. It was futile and
      irrelevant to try and explain that Deronda too had only been a monitor&mdash;the
      strongest of all monitors. Grandcourt was contemptuous, not jealous;
      contemptuously certain of all the subjection he cared for. Why could she
      not rebel and defy him? She longed to do it. But she might as well have
      tried to defy the texture of her nerves and the palpitation of her heart.
      Her husband had a ghostly army at his back, that could close round her
      wherever she might turn. She sat in her splendid attire, like a white
      image of helplessness, and he seemed to gratify himself with looking at
      her. She could not even make a passionate exclamation, or throw up her
      arms, as she would have done in her maiden days. The sense of his scorn
      kept her still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I ring?&rdquo; he said, after what seemed to her a long
      while. She moved her head in assent, and after ringing he went to his
      dressing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain words were gnawing within her. &ldquo;The wrong you have done me
      will be your own curse.&rdquo; As he closed the door, the bitter tears
      rose, and the gnawing words provoked an answer: &ldquo;Why did you put
      your fangs into me and not into him?&rdquo; It was uttered in a whisper,
      as the tears came up silently. But she immediately pressed her
      handkerchief against her eyes, and checked her tendency to sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, recovered from the shuddering fit of this evening scene, she
      determined to use the charter which Grandcourt had scornfully given her,
      and to talk as much as she liked with Deronda; but no opportunities
      occurred, and any little devices she could imagine for creating them were
      rejected by her pride, which was now doubly active. Not toward Deronda
      himself&mdash;she was singularly free from alarm lest he should think her
      openness wanting in dignity: it was part of his power over her that she
      believed him free from all misunderstanding as to the way in which she
      appealed to him; or rather, that he should misunderstand her had never
      entered into her mind. But the last morning came, and still she had never
      been able to take up the dropped thread of their talk, and she was without
      devices. She and Grandcourt were to leave at three o&rsquo;clock. It was
      too irritating that after a walk in the grounds had been planned in
      Deronda&rsquo;s hearing, he did not present himself to join in it.
      Grandcourt was gone with Sir Hugo to King&rsquo;s Topping, to see the old
      manor-house; others of the gentlemen were shooting; she was condemned to
      go and see the decoy and the waterfowl, and everything else that she least
      wanted to see, with the ladies, with old Lord Pentreath and his anecdotes,
      with Mr. Vandernoodt and his admiring manners. The irritation became too
      strong for her; without premeditation, she took advantage of the winding
      road to linger a little out of sight, and then set off back to the house,
      almost running when she was safe from observation. She entered by a side
      door, and the library was on her left hand; Deronda, she knew, was often
      there; why might she not turn in there as well as into any other room in
      the house? She had been taken there expressly to see the illuminated
      family tree, and other remarkable things&mdash;what more natural than that
      she should like to look in again? The thing most to be feared was that the
      room would be empty of Deronda, for the door was ajar. She pushed it
      gently, and looked round it. He was there, writing busily at a distant
      table, with his back toward the door (in fact, Sir Hugo had asked him to
      answer some constituents&rsquo; letters which had become pressing). An
      enormous log fire, with the scent of Russia from the books, made the great
      room as warmly odorous as a private chapel in which the censors have been
      swinging. It seemed too daring to go in&mdash;too rude to speak and
      interrupt him; yet she went in on the noiseless carpet, and stood still
      for two or three minutes, till Deronda, having finished a letter, pushed
      it aside for signature, and threw himself back to consider whether there
      were anything else for him to do, or whether he could walk out for the
      chance of meeting the party which included Gwendolen, when he heard her
      voice saying, &ldquo;Mr. Deronda.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly startling. He rose hastily, turned round, and pushed away
      his chair with a strong expression of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I wrong to come in?&rdquo; said Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were far on your walk,&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I turned back,&rdquo; said Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you intend to go out again? I could join you now, if you would
      allow me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I want to say something, and I can&rsquo;t stay long,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, speaking quickly in a subdued tone, while she walked
      forward and rested her arms and muff on the back of the chair he had
      pushed away from him. &ldquo;I want to tell you that it is really so&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t help feeling remorse for having injured others. That was what
      I meant when I said that I had done worse than gamble again and pawn the
      necklace again&mdash;something more injurious, as you called it. And I can&rsquo;t
      alter it. I am punished, but I can&rsquo;t alter it. You said I could do
      many things. Tell me again. What should you do&mdash;what should you feel
      if you were in my place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hurried directness with which she spoke&mdash;the absence of all her
      little airs, as if she were only concerned to use the time in getting an
      answer that would guide her, made her appeal unspeakably touching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda said, &ldquo;I should feel something of what you feel&mdash;deep
      sorrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what would you try to do?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with urgent
      quickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order my life so as to make any possible amends, and keep away from
      doing any sort of injury again,&rdquo; said Deronda, catching her sense
      that the time for speech was brief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t; I must go on,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, in a passionate loud whisper. &ldquo;I have thrust out others&mdash;I
      have made my gain out of their loss&mdash;tried to make it&mdash;tried.
      And I must go on. I can&rsquo;t alter it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to answer this instantaneously. Her words had confirmed
      his conjecture, and the situation of all concerned rose in swift images
      before him. His feeling for those who had been thrust out sanctioned her
      remorse; he could not try to nullify it, yet his heart was full of pity
      for her. But as soon as he could he answered&mdash;taking up her last
      words,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the bitterest of all&mdash;to wear the yoke of our own
      wrong-doing. But if you submitted to that as men submit to maiming or
      life-long incurable disease?&mdash;and made the unalterable wrong a reason
      for more effort toward a good, that may do something to counterbalance the
      evil? One who has committed irremediable errors may be scourged by that
      consciousness into a higher course than is common. There are many
      examples. Feeling what it is to have spoiled one life may well make us
      long to save other lives from being spoiled.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have not wronged any one, or spoiled their lives,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, hastily. &ldquo;It is only others who have wronged <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda colored slightly, but said immediately&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose our
      keen feeling for ourselves might end in giving us a keen feeling for
      others, if, when we are suffering acutely, we were to consider that others
      go through the same sharp experience. That is a sort of remorse before
      commission. Can&rsquo;t you understand that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I do&mdash;now,&rdquo; said Gwendolen. &ldquo;But you were
      right&mdash;I <i>am</i> selfish. I have never thought much of any one&rsquo;s
      feelings, except my mother&rsquo;s. I have not been fond of people. But
      what can I do?&rdquo; she went on, more quickly. &ldquo;I must get up in
      the morning and do what every one else does. It is all like a dance set
      beforehand. I seem to see all that can be&mdash;and I am tired and sick of
      it. And the world is all confusion to me&rdquo;&mdash;she made a gesture
      of disgust. &ldquo;You say I am ignorant. But what is the good of trying
      to know more, unless life were worth more?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This good,&rdquo; said Deronda promptly, with a touch of indignant
      severity, which he was inclined to encourage as his own safeguard; &ldquo;life
      <i>would</i> be worth more to you: some real knowledge would give you an
      interest in the world beyond the small drama of personal desires. It is
      the curse of your life&mdash;forgive me&mdash;of so many lives, that all
      passion is spent in that narrow round, for want of ideas and sympathies to
      make a larger home for it. Is there any single occupation of mind that you
      care about with passionate delight or even independent interest?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda paused, but Gwendolen, looking startled and thrilled as by an
      electric shock, said nothing, and he went on more insistently,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take what you said of music for a small example&mdash;it answers
      for all larger things&mdash;you will not cultivate it for the sake of a
      private joy in it. What sort of earth or heaven would hold any spiritual
      wealth in it for souls pauperized by inaction? If one firmament has no
      stimulus for our attention and awe, I don&rsquo;t see how four would have
      it. We should stamp every possible world with the flatness of our own
      inanity&mdash;which is necessarily impious, without faith or fellowship.
      The refuge you are needing from personal trouble is the higher, the
      religious life, which holds an enthusiasm for something more than our own
      appetites and vanities. The few may find themselves in it simply by an
      elevation of feeling; but for us who have to struggle for our wisdom, the
      higher life must be a region in which the affections are clad with
      knowledge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-indignant remonstrance that vibrated in Deronda&rsquo;s voice
      came, as often happens, from the habit of inward argument with himself
      rather than from severity toward Gwendolen: but it had a more beneficial
      effect on her than any soothings. Nothing is feebler than the indolent
      rebellion of complaint; and to be roused into self-judgment is comparative
      activity. For the moment she felt like a shaken child&mdash;shaken out of
      its wailing into awe, and she said humbly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try. I will think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They both stood silent for a minute, as if some third presence had
      arrested them,&mdash;for Deronda, too, was under that sense of pressure
      which is apt to come when our own winged words seem to be hovering around
      us,&mdash;till Gwendolen began again,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said affection was the best thing, and I have hardly any&mdash;none
      about me. If I could, I would have mamma; but that is impossible. Things
      have changed to me so&mdash;in such a short time. What I used not to like
      I long for now. I think I am almost getting fond of the old things now
      they are gone.&rdquo; Her lip trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the present suffering as a painful letting in of light,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, more gently. &ldquo;You are conscious of more beyond the
      round of your own inclinations&mdash;you know more of the way in which
      your life presses on others, and their life on yours. I don&rsquo;t think
      you could have escaped the painful process in some form or other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is a very cruel form,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, beating her
      foot on the ground with returning agitation. &ldquo;I am frightened at
      everything. I am frightened at myself. When my blood is fired I can do
      daring things&mdash;take any leap; but that makes me frightened at myself.&rdquo;
      She was looking at nothing outside her; but her eyes were directed toward
      the window, away from Deronda, who, with quick comprehension said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn your fear into a safeguard. Keep your dread fixed on the idea
      of increasing that remorse which is so bitter to you. Fixed meditation may
      do a great deal toward defining our longing or dread. We are not always in
      a state of strong emotion, and when we are calm we can use our memories
      and gradually change the bias of our fear, as we do our tastes. Take your
      fear as a safeguard. It is like quickness of hearing. It may make
      consequences passionately present to you. Try to take hold of your
      sensibility, and use it as if it were a faculty, like vision.&rdquo;
      Deronda uttered each sentence more urgently; he felt as if he were seizing
      a faint chance of rescuing her from some indefinite danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know; I understand what you mean,&rdquo; said Gwendolen in
      her loud whisper, not turning her eyes, but lifting up her small gloved
      hand and waving it in deprecation of the notion that it was easy to obey
      that advice. &ldquo;But if feelings rose&mdash;there are some feelings&mdash;hatred
      and anger&mdash;how can I be good when they keep rising? And if there came
      a moment when I felt stifled and could bear it no longer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      She broke off, and with agitated lips looked at Deronda, but the
      expression on his face pierced her with an entirely new feeling. He was
      under the baffling difficulty of discerning that what he had been urging
      on her was thrown into the pallid distance of mere thought before the
      outburst of her habitual emotion. It was as if he saw her drowning while
      his limbs were bound. The pained compassion which was spread over his
      features as he watched her, affected her with a compunction unlike any she
      had felt before, and in a changed and imploring tone she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grieving you. I am ungrateful. You <i>can</i> help me. I will
      think of everything. I will try. Tell me&mdash;it will not be a pain to
      you that I have dared to speak of my trouble to you? You began it, you
      know, when you rebuked me.&rdquo; There was a melancholy smile on her lips
      as she said that, but she added more entreatingly, &ldquo;It will not be a
      pain to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if it does anything to save you from an evil to come,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, with strong emphasis; &ldquo;otherwise, it will be a lasting
      pain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;it shall not be. It may be&mdash;it shall be
      better with me because I have known you.&rdquo; She turned immediately,
      and quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was on the first landing of the staircase, Sir Hugo passed across
      the hall on his way to the library, and saw her. Grandcourt was not with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda, when the baronet entered, was standing in his ordinary attitude,
      grasping his coat-collar, with his back to the table, and with that
      indefinable expression by which we judge that a man is still in the shadow
      of a scene which he has just gone through. He moved, however, and began to
      arrange the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mrs. Grandcourt been in here?&rdquo; said Sir Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she has.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the others?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she left them somewhere in the grounds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s silence, in which Sir Hugo looked at a letter
      without reading it, he said &ldquo;I hope you are not playing with fire,
      Dan&mdash;you understand me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I do, sir,&rdquo; said Deronda, after a slight
      hesitation, which had some repressed anger in it. &ldquo;But there is
      nothing answering to your metaphor&mdash;no fire, and therefore no chance
      of scorching.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Hugo looked searchingly at him, and then said, &ldquo;So much the
      better. For, between ourselves, I fancy there may be some hidden gunpowder
      in that establishment.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXVII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  <i>Aspern.</i>    Pardon, my lord&mdash;I speak for Sigismund.
  <i>Fronsberg.</i> For him? Oh, ay&mdash;for him I always hold
               A pardon safe in bank, sure he will draw
               Sooner or later on me. What his need?
               Mad project broken? fine mechanic wings
               That would not fly? durance, assault on watch,
               Bill for Epernay, not a crust to eat?
  <i>Aspern.</i>    Oh, none of these, my lord; he has escaped
               From Circe&rsquo;s herd, and seeks to win the love
               Of your fair ward Cecilia: but would win
               First your consent. You frown.
  <i>Fronsberg.</i>                         Distinguish words.
               I said I held a pardon, not consent.
</pre>
    <p>
      In spite of Deronda&rsquo;s reasons for wishing to be in town again&mdash;reasons
      in which his anxiety for Mirah was blent with curiosity to know more of
      the enigmatic Mordecai&mdash;he did not manage to go up before Sir Hugo,
      who preceded his family that he might be ready for the opening of
      Parliament on the sixth of February. Deronda took up his quarters in Park
      Lane, aware that his chambers were sufficiently tenanted by Hans Meyrick.
      This was what he expected; but he found other things not altogether
      according to his expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of us remember Retzsch&rsquo;s drawing of destiny in the shape of
      Mephistopheles playing at chess with man for his soul, a game in which we
      may imagine the clever adversary making a feint of unintended moves so as
      to set the beguiled mortal on carrying his defensive pieces away from the
      true point of attack. The fiend makes preparation his favorite object of
      mockery, that he may fatally persuade us against our taking out
      waterproofs when he is well aware the sky is going to clear, foreseeing
      that the imbecile will turn this delusion into a prejudice against
      waterproofs instead of giving a closer study to the weather-signs. It is a
      peculiar test of a man&rsquo;s mettle when, after he has painfully
      adjusted himself to what seems a wise provision, he finds all his mental
      precaution a little beside the mark, and his excellent intentions no
      better than miscalculated dovetails, accurately cut from a wrong
      starting-point. His magnanimity has got itself ready to meet misbehavior,
      and finds quite a different call upon it. Something of this kind happened
      to Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first impression was one of pure pleasure and amusement at finding his
      sitting-room transformed into an <i>atelier</i> strewed with miscellaneous
      drawings and with the contents of two chests from Rome, the lower half of
      the windows darkened with baize, and the blonde Hans in his weird youth as
      the presiding genius of the littered place&mdash;his hair longer than of
      old, his face more whimsically creased, and his high voice as usual
      getting higher under the excitement of rapid talk. The friendship of the
      two had been kept up warmly since the memorable Cambridge time, not only
      by correspondence but by little episodes of companionship abroad and in
      England, and the original relation of confidence on one side and
      indulgence on the other had been developed in practice, as is wont to be
      the case where such spiritual borrowing and lending has been well begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would like to see my casts and antiquities,&rdquo; said
      Hans, after the first hearty greetings and inquiries, &ldquo;so I didn&rsquo;t
      scruple to unlade my chests here. But I&rsquo;ve found two rooms at
      Chelsea not many hundred yards from my mother and sisters, and I shall
      soon be ready to hang out there&mdash;when they&rsquo;ve scraped the walls
      and put in some new lights. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m waiting for. But
      you see I don&rsquo;t wait to begin work: you can&rsquo;t conceive what a
      great fellow I&rsquo;m going to be. The seed of immortality has sprouted
      within me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a fungoid growth, I dare say&mdash;a growing disease in the
      lungs,&rdquo; said Deronda, accustomed to treat Hans in brotherly fashion.
      He was walking toward some drawings propped on the ledge of his bookcases;
      five rapidly-sketched heads&mdash;different aspects of the same face. He
      stood at a convenient distance from them, without making any remark. Hans,
      too, was silent for a minute, took up his palette and began touching the
      picture on his easel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of them?&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The full face looks too massive; otherwise the likenesses are good,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, more coldly than was usual with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not too massive,&rdquo; said Hans, decisively. &ldquo;I
      have noted that. There is always a little surprise when one passes from
      the profile to the full face. But I shall enlarge her scale for Berenice.
      I am making a Berenice series&mdash;look at the sketches along there&mdash;and
      now I think of it, you are just the model I want for the Agrippa.&rdquo;
      Hans, still with pencil and palette in hand, had moved to Deronda&rsquo;s
      side while he said this, but he added hastily, as if conscious of a
      mistake, &ldquo;No, no, I forgot; you don&rsquo;t like sitting for your
      portrait, confound you! However, I&rsquo;ve picked up a capital Titus.
      There are to be five in the series. The first is Berenice clasping the
      knees of Gessius Florus and beseeching him to spare her people; I&rsquo;ve
      got that on the easel. Then, this, where she is standing on the Xystus
      with Agrippa, entreating the people not to injure themselves by
      resistance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agrippa&rsquo;s legs will never do,&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The legs are good realistically,&rdquo; said Hans, his face
      creasing drolly; &ldquo;public men are often shaky about the legs&mdash;&rsquo;
      Their legs, the emblem of their various thought,&rsquo; as somebody says
      in the <i>Rehearsal.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But these are as impossible as the legs of Raphael&rsquo;s
      Alcibiades,&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they are good ideally,&rdquo; said Hans. &ldquo;Agrippa&rsquo;s
      legs were possibly bad; I idealize that and make them impossibly bad. Art,
      my Eugenius, must intensify. But never mind the legs now: the third sketch
      in the series is Berenice exulting in the prospects of being Empress of
      Rome, when the news has come that Vespasian is declared Emperor and her
      lover Titus his successor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must put a scroll in her mouth, else people will not understand
      that. You can&rsquo;t tell that in a picture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will make them feel their ignorance then&mdash;an excellent
      æsthetic effect. The fourth is, Titus sending Berenice away from Rome
      after she has shared his palace for ten years&mdash;both reluctant, both
      sad&mdash;<i>invitus invitam</i>, as Suetonius hath it. I&rsquo;ve found a
      model for the Roman brute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you make Berenice look fifty? She must have been that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; a few mature touches to show the lapse of time. Dark-eyed
      beauty wears well, hers particularly. But now, here is the fifth: Berenice
      seated lonely on the ruins of Jerusalem. That is pure imagination. That is
      what ought to have been&mdash;perhaps was. Now, see how I tell a pathetic
      negative. Nobody knows what became of her&mdash;that is finely indicated
      by the series coming to a close. There is no sixth picture.&rdquo; Here
      Hans pretended to speak with a gasping sense of sublimity, and drew back
      his head with a frown, as if looking for a like impression on Deronda.
      &ldquo;I break off in the Homeric style. The story is chipped off, so to
      speak, and passes with a ragged edge into nothing&mdash;<i>le néant</i>;
      can anything be more sublime, especially in French? The vulgar would
      desire to see her corpse and burial&mdash;perhaps her will read and her
      linen distributed. But now come and look at this on the easel. I have made
      some way there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That beseeching attitude is really good,&rdquo; said Deronda, after
      a moment&rsquo;s contemplation. &ldquo;You have been very industrious in
      the Christmas holidays; for I suppose you have taken up the subject since
      you came to London.&rdquo; Neither of them had yet mentioned Mirah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hans, putting touches to his picture, &ldquo;I made
      up my mind to the subject before. I take that lucky chance for an augury
      that I am going to burst on the world as a great painter. I saw a splendid
      woman in the Trastevere&mdash;the grandest women there are half Jewesses&mdash;and
      she set me hunting for a fine situation of a Jewess at Rome. Like other
      men of vast learning, I ended by taking what lay on the surface. I&rsquo;ll
      show you a sketch of the Trasteverina&rsquo;s head when I can lay my hands
      on it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think she would be a more suitable model for Berenice,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, not knowing exactly how to express his discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it. The model ought to be the most beautiful Jewess in
      the world, and I have found her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you made yourself sure that she would like to figure in that
      character? I should think no woman would be more abhorrent to her. Does
      she quite know what you are doing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I got her to throw herself precisely into this attitude.
      Little mother sat for Gessius Florus, and Mirah clasped her knees.&rdquo;
      Here Hans went a little way off and looked at the effect of his touches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say she knows nothing about Berenice&rsquo;s history,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, feeling more indignation than he would have been able to
      justify.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, she does&mdash;ladies&rsquo; edition. Berenice was a
      fervid patriot, but was beguiled by love and ambition into attaching
      herself to the arch-enemy of her people. Whence the Nemesis. Mirah takes
      it as a tragic parable, and cries to think what the penitent Berenice
      suffered as she wandered back to Jerusalem and sat desolate amidst
      desolation. That was her own phrase. I couldn&rsquo;t find it in my heart
      to tell her I invented that part of the story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me your Trasteverina,&rdquo; said Deronda, chiefly in order to
      hinder himself from saying something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you mind turning over that folio?&rdquo; said Hans. &ldquo;My
      studies of heads are all there. But they are in confusion. You will
      perhaps find her next to a crop-eared undergraduate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After Deronda had been turning over the drawings a minute or two, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These seem to be all Cambridge heads and bits of country. Perhaps I
      had better begin at the other end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you&rsquo;ll find her about the middle. I emptied one folio
      into another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this one of your undergraduates?&rdquo; said Deronda, holding up
      a drawing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an unusually agreeable face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That! Oh, that&rsquo;s a man named Gascoigne&mdash;Rex Gascoigne.
      An uncommonly good fellow; his upper lip, too, is good. I coached him
      before he got his scholarship. He ought to have taken honors last Easter.
      But he was ill, and has had to stay up another year. I must look him up. I
      want to know how he&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here she is, I suppose,&rdquo; said Deronda, holding up a sketch of
      the Trasteverina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Hans, looking at it rather contemptuously, &ldquo;too
      coarse. I was unregenerate then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda was silent while he closed the folio, leaving the Trasteverina
      outside. Then clasping his coat-collar, and turning toward Hans, he said,
      &ldquo;I dare say my scruples are excessive, Meyrick, but I must ask you
      to oblige me by giving up this notion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hans threw himself into a tragic attitude, and screamed, &ldquo;What! my
      series&mdash;my immortal Berenice series? Think of what you are saying,
      man&mdash;destroying, as Milton says, not a life but an immortality. Wait
      before you answer, that I may deposit the implements of my art and be
      ready to uproot my hair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Hans laid down his pencil and palette, threw himself backward into a
      great chair, and hanging limply over the side, shook his long hair over
      his face, lifted his hooked fingers on each side his head, and looked up
      with comic terror at Deronda, who was obliged to smile, as he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paint as many Berenices as you like, but I wish you could feel with
      me&mdash;perhaps you will, on reflection&mdash;that you should choose
      another model.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Hans, standing up, and looking serious again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she may get into such a position that her face is likely to
      be recognized. Mrs. Meyrick and I are anxious for her that she should be
      known as an admirable singer. It is right, and she wishes it, that she
      should make herself independent. And she has excellent chances. One good
      introduction is secured already, and I am going to speak to Klesmer. Her
      face may come to be very well known, and&mdash;well, it is useless to
      attempt to explain, unless you feel as I do. I believe that if Mirah saw
      the circumstances clearly, she would strongly object to being exhibited in
      this way&mdash;to allowing herself to be used as a model for a heroine of
      this sort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As Hans stood with his thumbs in the belt of his blouse, listening to this
      speech, his face showed a growing surprise melting into amusement, that at
      last would have its way in an explosive laugh: but seeing that Deronda
      looked gravely offended, he checked himself to say, &ldquo;Excuse my
      laughing, Deronda. You never gave me an advantage over you before. If it
      had been about anything but my own pictures, I should have swallowed every
      word because you said it. And so you actually believe that I should get my
      five pictures hung on the line in a conspicuous position, and carefully
      studied by the public? Zounds, man! cider-cup and conceit never gave me
      half such a beautiful dream. My pictures are likely to remain as private
      as the utmost hypersensitiveness could desire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hans turned to paint again as a way of filling up awkward pauses. Deronda
      stood perfectly still, recognizing his mistake as to publicity, but also
      conscious that his repugnance was not much diminished. He was the reverse
      of satisfied either with himself or with Hans; but the power of being
      quiet carries a man well through moments of embarrassment. Hans had a
      reverence for his friend which made him feel a sort of shyness at Deronda&rsquo;s
      being in the wrong; but it was not in his nature to give up anything
      readily, though it were only a whim&mdash;or rather, especially if it were
      a whim, and he presently went on, painting the while,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even supposing I had a public rushing after my pictures as if
      they were a railway series including nurses, babies and bonnet-boxes, I
      can&rsquo;t see any justice in your objection. Every painter worth
      remembering has painted the face he admired most, as often as he could. It
      is a part of his soul that goes out into his pictures. He diffuses its
      influence in that way. He puts what he hates into a caricature. He puts
      what he adores into some sacred, heroic form. If a man could paint the
      woman he loves a thousand times as the <i>Stella Marts</i> to put courage
      into the sailors on board a thousand ships, so much the more honor to her.
      Isn&rsquo;t that better than painting a piece of staring immodesty and
      calling it by a worshipful name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every objection can be answered if you take broad ground enough,
      Hans: no special question of conduct can be properly settled in that way,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, with a touch of peremptoriness. &ldquo;I might admit all
      your generalities, and yet be right in saying you ought not to publish
      Mirah&rsquo;s face as a model for Berenice. But I give up the question of
      publicity. I was unreasonable there.&rdquo; Deronda hesitated a moment.
      &ldquo;Still, even as a private affair, there might be good reasons for
      your not indulging yourself too much in painting her from the point of
      view you mention. You must feel that her situation at present is a very
      delicate one; and until she is in more independence, she should be kept as
      carefully as a bit of Venetian glass, for fear of shaking her out of the
      safe place she is lodged in. Are you quite sure of your own discretion?
      Excuse me, Hans. My having found her binds me to watch over her. Do you
      understand me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said Hans, turning his face into a good-humored
      smile. &ldquo;You have the very justifiable opinion of me that I am likely
      to shatter all the glass in my way, and break my own skull into the
      bargain. Quite fair. Since I got into the scrape of being born, everything
      I have liked best has been a scrape either for myself or somebody else.
      Everything I have taken to heartily has somehow turned into a scrape. My
      painting is the last scrape; and I shall be all my life getting out of it.
      You think now I shall get into a scrape at home. No; I am regenerate. You
      think I must be over head and ears in love with Mirah. Quite right; so I
      am. But you think I shall scream and plunge and spoil everything. There
      you are mistaken&mdash;excusably, but transcendently mistaken. I have
      undergone baptism by immersion. Awe takes care of me. Ask the little
      mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t reckon a hopeless love among your scrapes, then,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, whose voice seemed to get deeper as Hans&rsquo;s went
      higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to call mine hopeless,&rdquo; said Hans, with
      provoking coolness, laying down his tools, thrusting his thumbs into his
      belt, and moving away a little, as if to contemplate his picture more
      deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, you are only preparing misery for yourself,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, decisively. &ldquo;She would not marry a Christian, even if
      she loved him. Have you heard her&mdash;of course you have&mdash;heard her
      speak of her people and her religion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That can&rsquo;t last,&rdquo; said Hans. &ldquo;She will see no Jew
      who is tolerable. Every male of that race is insupportable&mdash;&lsquo;insupportably
      advancing&rsquo;&mdash;his nose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may rejoin her family. That is what she longs for. Her mother
      and brother are probably strict Jews.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn proselyte, if she wishes it,&rdquo; said Hans, with
      a shrug and a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, Hans. I thought you professed a serious
      love for her,&rdquo; said Deronda, getting heated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I do. You think it desperate, but I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing; I can&rsquo;t tell what has happened. We must be
      prepared for surprises. But I can hardly imagine a greater surprise to me
      than that there should have seemed to be anything in Mirah&rsquo;s
      sentiments for you to found a romantic hope on.&rdquo; Deronda felt that
      he was too contemptuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t found my romantic hopes on a woman&rsquo;s
      sentiments,&rdquo; said Hans, perversely inclined to be the merrier when
      he was addressed with gravity. &ldquo;I go to science and philosophy for
      my romance. Nature designed Mirah to fall in love with me. The
      amalgamation of races demands it&mdash;the mitigation of human ugliness
      demands it&mdash;the affinity of contrasts assures it. I am the utmost
      contrast to Mirah&mdash;a bleached Christian, who can&rsquo;t sing two
      notes in tune. Who has a chance against me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see now; it was all <i>persiflage</i>. You don&rsquo;t mean a
      word you say, Meyrick,&rdquo; said Deronda, laying his hand on Meyrick&rsquo;s
      shoulder, and speaking in a tone of cordial relief. &ldquo;I was a
      wiseacre to answer you seriously.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honor I do mean it, though,&rdquo; said Hans, facing round
      and laying his left hand on Deronda&rsquo;s shoulder, so that their eyes
      fronted each other closely. &ldquo;I am at the confessional. I meant to
      tell you as soon as you came. My mother says you are Mirah&rsquo;s
      guardian, and she thinks herself responsible to you for every breath that
      falls on Mirah in her house. Well, I love her&mdash;I worship her&mdash;I
      won&rsquo;t despair&mdash;I mean to deserve her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, you can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have said, I mean to try.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep your resolve, Hans. You used to resolve what
      you would do for your mother and sisters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a right to reproach me, old fellow,&rdquo; said Hans,
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am ungenerous,&rdquo; said Deronda, not apologetically,
      however. &ldquo;Yet it can&rsquo;t be ungenerous to warn you that you are
      indulging mad, Quixotic expectations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will be hurt but myself, then?&rdquo; said Hans, putting out
      his lip. &ldquo;I am not going to say anything to her unless I felt sure
      of the answer. I dare not ask the oracles: I prefer a cheerful
      caliginosity, as Sir Thomas Browne might say. I would rather run my chance
      there and lose, than be sure of winning anywhere else. And I don&rsquo;t
      mean to swallow the poison of despair, though you are disposed to thrust
      it on me. I am giving up wine, so let me get a little drunk on hope and
      vanity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart, if it will do you any good,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      loosing Hans&rsquo;s shoulder, with a little push. He made his tone
      kindly, but his words were from the lip only. As to his real feeling he
      was silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of that peculiar irritation which will sometimes befall
      the man whom others are inclined to trust as a mentor&mdash;the irritation
      of perceiving that he is supposed to be entirely off the same plane of
      desire and temptation as those who confess to him. Our guides, we pretend,
      must be sinless: as if those were not often the best teachers who only
      yesterday got corrected for their mistakes. Throughout their friendship
      Deronda had been used to Hans&rsquo;s egotism, but he had never before
      felt intolerant of it: when Hans, habitually pouring out his own feelings
      and affairs, had never cared for any detail in return, and, if he chanced
      to know any, had soon forgotten it. Deronda had been inwardly as well as
      outwardly indulgent&mdash;nay, satisfied. But now he had noted with some
      indignation, all the stronger because it must not be betrayed, Hans&rsquo;s
      evident assumption that for any danger of rivalry or jealousy in relation
      to Mirah, Deronda was not as much out of the question as the angel
      Gabriel. It is one thing to be resolute in placing one&rsquo;s self out of
      the question, and another to endure that others should perform that
      exclusion for us. He had expected that Hans would give him trouble: what
      he had not expected was that the trouble would have a strong element of
      personal feeling. And he was rather ashamed that Hans&rsquo;s hopes caused
      him uneasiness in spite of his well-warranted conviction that they would
      never be fulfilled. They had raised an image of Mirah changing; and
      however he might protest that the change would not happen, the protest
      kept up the unpleasant image. Altogether poor Hans seemed to be entering
      into Deronda&rsquo;s experience in a disproportionate manner&mdash;going
      beyond his part of rescued prodigal, and rousing a feeling quite distinct
      from compassionate affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Deronda went to Chelsea he was not made as comfortable as he ought to
      have been by Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s evident release from anxiety about the
      beloved but incalculable son. Mirah seemed livelier than before, and for
      the first time he saw her laugh. It was when they were talking of Hans, he
      being naturally the mother&rsquo;s first topic. Mirah wished to know if
      Deronda had seen Mr. Hans going through a sort of character piece without
      changing his dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He passes from one figure to another as if he were a bit of flame
      where you fancied the figures without seeing them,&rdquo; said Mirah, full
      of her subject; &ldquo;he is so wonderfully quick. I used never to like
      comic things on the stage&mdash;they were dwelt on too long; but all in
      one minute Mr. Hans makes himself a blind bard, and then Rienzi addressing
      the Romans, and then an opera-dancer, and then a desponding young
      gentleman&mdash;I am sorry for them all, and yet I laugh, all in one&rdquo;&mdash;here
      Mirah gave a little laugh that might have entered into a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hardly thought that Mirah could laugh till Hans came,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Meyrick, seeing that Deronda, like herself, was observing the
      pretty picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hans seems in great force just now,&rdquo; said Deronda in a tone
      of congratulation. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at his enlivening you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been just perfect ever since he came back,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Meyrick, keeping to herself the next clause&mdash;&ldquo;if it will
      but last.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great happiness,&rdquo; said Mirah, &ldquo;to see the son
      and brother come into this dear home. And I hear them all talk about what
      they did together when they were little. That seems like heaven, and to
      have a mother and brother who talk in that way. I have never had it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Deronda, involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Mirah, regretfully. &ldquo;I wish you had. I wish
      you had had every good.&rdquo; The last words were uttered with a serious
      ardor as if they had been part of a litany, while her eyes were fixed on
      Deronda, who with his elbow on the back of his chair was contemplating her
      by the new light of the impression she had made on Hans, and the
      possibility of her being attracted by that extraordinary contrast. It was
      no more than what had happened on each former visit of his, that Mirah
      appeared to enjoy speaking of what she felt very much as a little girl
      fresh from school pours forth spontaneously all the long-repressed chat
      for which she has found willing ears. For the first time in her life Mirah
      was among those whom she entirely trusted, and her original visionary
      impression that Deronda was a divinely-sent messenger hung about his image
      still, stirring always anew the disposition to reliance and openness. It
      was in this way she took what might have been the injurious flattery of
      admiring attention into which her helpless dependence had been suddenly
      transformed. Every one around her watched for her looks and words, and the
      effect on her was simply that of having passed from a trifling
      imprisonment into an exhilarating air which made speech and action a
      delight. To her mind it was all a gift from others&rsquo; goodness. But
      that word of Deronda&rsquo;s implying that there had been some lack in his
      life which might be compared with anything she had known in hers, was an
      entirely new inlet of thought about him. After her first expression of
      sorrowful surprise she went on,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Hans said yesterday that you thought so much of others you
      hardly wanted anything for yourself. He told us a wonderful story of
      Buddha giving himself to the famished tigress to save her and her little
      ones from starving. And he said you were like Buddha. That is what we all
      imagine of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t imagine that,&rdquo; said Deronda, who had lately
      been finding such suppositions rather exasperating. &ldquo;Even if it were
      true that I thought so much of others, it would not follow that I had no
      wants for myself. When Buddha let the tigress eat him he might have been
      very hungry himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps if he was starved he would not mind so much about being
      eaten,&rdquo; said Mab, shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t think that, Mab; it takes away the beauty of the
      action,&rdquo; said Mirah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it were true, Mirah?&rdquo; said the rational Amy, having a
      half-holiday from her teaching; &ldquo;you always take what is beautiful
      as if it were true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Mirah, gently. &ldquo;If people have thought
      what is the most beautiful and the best thing, it must be true. It is
      always there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mirah, what do you mean?&rdquo; said Amy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand her,&rdquo; said Deronda, coming to the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a truth in thought though it may never have been carried out
      in action. It lives as an idea. Is that it?&rdquo; He turned to Mirah, who
      was listening with a blind look in her lovely eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be that, because you understand me, but I cannot quite
      explain,&rdquo; said Mirah, rather abstractedly&mdash;still searching for
      some expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>was</i> it beautiful for Buddha to let the tiger eat him?&rdquo;
      said Amy, changing her ground. &ldquo;It would be a bad pattern.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world would get full of fat tigers,&rdquo; said Mab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda laughed, but defended the myth. &ldquo;It is like a passionate
      word,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the exaggeration is a flash of fervor. It is
      an extreme image of what is happening every day&mdash;the transmutation of
      self.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can say what I mean, now,&rdquo; said Mirah, who had not
      heard the intermediate talk. &ldquo;When the best thing comes into our
      thoughts, it is like what my mother has been to me. She has been just as
      really with me as all the other people about me&mdash;often more really
      with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda, inwardly wincing under this illustration, which brought other
      possible realities about that mother vividly before him, presently turned
      the conversation by saying, &ldquo;But we must not get too far away from
      practical matters. I came, for one thing, to tell of an interview I had
      yesterday, which I hope Mirah will find to have been useful to her. It was
      with Klesmer, the great pianist.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick, with satisfaction. &ldquo;You think
      he will help her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so. He is very much occupied, but has promised to fix a time
      for receiving and hearing Miss Lapidoth, as we must learn to call her&rdquo;&mdash;here
      Deronda smiled at Mirah&mdash;&ldquo;If she consents to go to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very grateful,&rdquo; said Mirah. &ldquo;He wants to
      hear me sing, before he can judge whether I ought to be helped.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda was struck with her plain sense about these matters of practical
      concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not be at all trying to you, I hope, if Mrs. Meyrick will
      kindly go with you to Klesmer&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not at all trying. I have been doing that all my life&mdash;I
      mean, told to do things that others may judge of me. And I have gone
      through a bad trial of that sort. I am prepared to bear it, and do some
      very small thing. Is Klesmer a severe man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is peculiar, but I have not had experience enough of him to know
      whether he would be what you would call severe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he is kind-hearted&mdash;kind in action, if not in speech.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been used to be frowned at and not praised,&rdquo; said
      Mirah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the by, Klesmer frowns a good deal,&rdquo; said Deronda, &ldquo;but
      there is often a sort of smile in his eyes all the while. Unhappily he
      wears spectacles, so you must catch him in the right light to see the
      smile.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not be frightened,&rdquo; said Mirah. &ldquo;If he were
      like a roaring lion, he only wants me to sing. I shall do what I can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I feel sure you will not mind being invited to sing in Lady
      Mallinger&rsquo;s drawing-room,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;She intends to
      ask you next month, and will invite many ladies to hear you, who are
      likely to want lessons from you for their daughters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How fast we are mounting!&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick, with delight.
      &ldquo;You never thought of getting grand so quickly, Mirah.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a little frightened at being called Miss Lapidoth,&rdquo; said
      Mirah, coloring with a new uneasiness. &ldquo;Might I be called Cohen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said Deronda, promptly. &ldquo;But I
      assure you, you must not be called Cohen. The name is inadmissible for a
      singer. This is one of the trifles in which we must conform to vulgar
      prejudice. We could choose some other name, however&mdash;such as singers
      ordinarily choose&mdash;an Italian or Spanish name, which would suit your
      <i>physique</i>.&rdquo; To Deronda just now the name Cohen was equivalent
      to the ugliest of yellow badges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah reflected a little, anxiously, then said, &ldquo;No. If Cohen will
      not do, I will keep the name I have been called by. I will not hide
      myself. I have friends to protect me. And now&mdash;if my father were very
      miserable and wanted help&mdash;no,&rdquo; she said, looking at Mrs.
      Meyrick, &ldquo;I should think, then, that he was perhaps crying as I used
      to see him, and had nobody to pity him, and I had hidden myself from him.
      He had none belonging to him but me. Others that made friends with him
      always left him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep to what you feel right, my dear child,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Meyrick. &ldquo;<i>I</i> would not persuade you to the contrary.&rdquo;
      For her own part she had no patience or pity for that father, and would
      have left him to his crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda was saying to himself, &ldquo;I am rather base to be angry with
      Hans. How can he help being in love with her? But it is too absurdly
      presumptuous for him even to frame the idea of appropriating her, and a
      sort of blasphemy to suppose that she could possibly give herself to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What would it be for Daniel Deronda to entertain such thoughts? He was not
      one who could quite naively introduce himself where he had just excluded
      his friend, yet it was undeniable that what had just happened made a new
      stage in his feeling toward Mirah. But apart from other grounds for
      self-repression, reasons both definite and vague made him shut away that
      question as he might have shut up a half-opened writing that would have
      carried his imagination too far, and given too much shape to
      presentiments. Might there not come a disclosure which would hold the
      missing determination of his course? What did he really know about his
      origin? Strangely in these latter months when it seemed right that he
      should exert his will in the choice of a destination, the passion of his
      nature had got more and more locked by this uncertainty. The disclosure
      might bring its pain, indeed the likelihood seemed to him to be all on
      that side; but if it helped him to make his life a sequence which would
      take the form of duty&mdash;if it saved him from having to make an
      arbitrary selection where he felt no preponderance of desire? Still more,
      he wanted to escape standing as a critic outside the activities of men,
      stiffened into the ridiculous attitude of self-assigned superiority. His
      chief tether was his early inwrought affection for Sir Hugo, making him
      gratefully deferential to wishes with which he had little agreement: but
      gratitude had been sometimes disturbed by doubts which were near reducing
      it to a fear of being ungrateful. Many of us complain that half our
      birthright is sharp duty: Deronda was more inclined to complain that he
      was robbed of this half; yet he accused himself, as he would have accused
      another, of being weakly self-conscious and wanting in resolve. He was the
      reverse of that type painted for us in Faulconbridge and Edmund of
      Gloster, whose coarse ambition for personal success is inflamed by a
      defiance of accidental disadvantages. To Daniel the words Father and
      Mother had the altar-fire in them; and the thought of all closest
      relations of our nature held still something of the mystic power which had
      made his neck and ears burn in boyhood. The average man may regard this
      sensibility on the question of birth as preposterous and hardly credible;
      but with the utmost respect for his knowledge as the rock from which all
      other knowledge is hewn, it must be admitted that many well-proved facts
      are dark to the average man, even concerning the action of his own heart
      and the structure of his own retina. A century ago he and all his
      forefathers had not had the slightest notion of that electric discharge by
      means of which they had all wagged their tongues mistakenly; any more than
      they were awake to the secluded anguish of exceptional sensitiveness into
      which many a carelessly-begotten child of man is born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the ferment was all the stronger in Deronda&rsquo;s mind because
      he had never had a confidant to whom he could open himself on these
      delicate subjects. He had always been leaned on instead of being invited
      to lean. Sometimes he had longed for the sort of friend to whom he might
      possibly unfold his experience: a young man like himself who sustained a
      private grief and was not too confident about his own career; speculative
      enough to understand every moral difficulty, yet socially susceptible, as
      he himself was, and having every outward sign of equality either in bodily
      or spiritual wrestling&mdash;for he had found it impossible to reciprocate
      confidences with one who looked up to him. But he had no expectation of
      meeting the friend he imagined. Deronda&rsquo;s was not one of those
      quiveringly-poised natures that lend themselves to second-sight.

      CHAPTER XXXVIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    There be who hold that the deeper tragedy were a Prometheus Bound not
    <i>after</i> but <i>before</i> he had well got the celestial fire into
    the <i>narthex</i> whereby it might be conveyed to mortals: thrust by
    the Kratos and Bia of instituted methods into a solitude of despised
    ideas, fastened in throbbing helplessness by the fatal pressure of
    poverty and disease&mdash;a solitude where many pass by, but none regard.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Second-sight&rdquo; is a flag over disputed ground. But it is
      matter of knowledge that there are persons whose yearnings, conceptions&mdash;nay,
      traveled conclusions&mdash;continually take the form of images which have
      a foreshadowing power; the deed they would do starts up before them in
      complete shape, making a coercive type; the event they hunger for or dread
      rises into vision with a seed-like growth, feeding itself fast on
      unnumbered impressions. They are not always the less capable of the
      argumentative process, nor less sane than the commonplace calculators of
      the market: sometimes it may be that their natures have manifold openings,
      like the hundred-gated Thebes, where there may naturally be a greater and
      more miscellaneous inrush than through a narrow beadle-watched portal. No
      doubt there are abject specimens of the visionary, as there is a minim
      mammal which you might imprison in the finger of your glove. That small
      relative of the elephant has no harm in him; but what great mental or
      social type is free from specimens whose insignificance is both ugly and
      noxious? One is afraid to think of all that the genus &ldquo;patriot&rdquo;
      embraces; or of the elbowing there might be at the day of judgment for
      those who ranked as authors, and brought volumes either in their hands or
      on trucks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This apology for inevitable kinship is meant to usher in some facts about
      Mordecai, whose figure had bitten itself into Deronda&rsquo;s mind as a
      new question which he felt an interest in getting answered. But the
      interest was no more than a vaguely-expectant suspense: the
      consumptive-looking Jew, apparently a fervid student of some kind, getting
      his crust by a quiet handicraft, like Spinoza, fitted into none of Deronda&rsquo;s
      anticipations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was otherwise with the effect of their meeting on Mordecai. For many
      winters, while he had been conscious of an ebbing physical life, and as
      widening spiritual loneliness, all his passionate desire had concentrated
      itself in the yearning for some young ear into which he could pour his
      mind as a testament, some soul kindred enough to accept the spiritual
      product of his own brief, painful life, as a mission to be executed. It
      was remarkable that the hopefulness which is often the beneficent illusion
      of consumptive patients, was in Mordecai wholly diverted from the prospect
      of bodily recovery and carried into the current of this yearning for
      transmission. The yearning, which had panted upward from out of
      over-whelming discouragements, had grown into a hope&mdash;the hope into a
      confident belief, which, instead of being checked by the clear conception
      he had of his hastening decline, took rather the intensity of expectant
      faith in a prophecy which has only brief space to get fulfilled in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some years had now gone since he had first begun to measure men with a
      keen glance, searching for a possibility which became more and more a
      distinct conception. Such distinctness as it had at first was reached
      chiefly by a method of contrast: he wanted to find a man who differed from
      himself. Tracing reasons in that self for the rebuffs he had met with and
      the hindrances that beset him, he imagined a man who would have all the
      elements necessary for sympathy with him, but in an embodiment unlike his
      own: he must be a Jew, intellectually cultured, morally fervid&mdash;in
      all this a nature ready to be plenished from Mordecai&rsquo;s; but his
      face and frame must be beautiful and strong, he must have been used to all
      the refinements of social life, his voice must flow with a full and easy
      current, his circumstances be free from sordid need: he must glorify the
      possibilities of the Jew, not sit and wonder as Mordecai did, bearing the
      stamp of his people amid the sign of poverty and waning breath. Sensitive
      to physical characteristics, he had, both abroad and in England, looked at
      pictures as well as men, and in a vacant hour he had sometimes lingered in
      the National Gallery in search of paintings which might feed his
      hopefulness with grave and noble types of the human form, such as might
      well belong to men of his own race. But he returned in disappointment. The
      instances are scattered but thinly over the galleries of Europe, in which
      the fortune or selection even of the chief masters has given to art a face
      at once young, grand, and beautiful, where, if there is any melancholy, it
      is no feeble passivity, but enters into the foreshadowed capability of
      heroism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some observant persons may perhaps remember his emaciated figure, and dark
      eyes deep in their sockets, as he stood in front of a picture that had
      touched him either to new or habitual meditation: he commonly wore a cloth
      cap with black fur round it, which no painter would have asked him to take
      off. But spectators would be likely to think of him as an odd-looking Jew
      who probably got money out of pictures; and Mordecai, when he looked at
      them, was perfectly aware of the impression he made. Experience had
      rendered him morbidly alive to the effect of a man&rsquo;s poverty and
      other physical disadvantages in cheapening his ideas, unless they are
      those of a Peter the Hermit who has a tocsin for the rabble. But he was
      too sane and generous to attribute his spiritual banishment solely to the
      excusable prejudices of others; certain incapacities of his own had made
      the sentence of exclusion; and hence it was that his imagination had
      constructed another man who would be something more ample than the second
      soul bestowed, according to the notion of the Cabalists, to help out the
      insufficient first&mdash;who would be a blooming human life, ready to
      incorporate all that was worthiest in an existence whose visible, palpable
      part was burning itself fast away. His inward need for the conception of
      this expanded, prolonged self was reflected as an outward necessity. The
      thoughts of his heart (that ancient phrase best shadows the truth) seemed
      to him too precious, too closely interwoven with the growth of things not
      to have a further destiny. And as the more beautiful, the stronger, the
      more executive self took shape in his mind, he loved it beforehand with an
      affection half identifying, half contemplative and grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai&rsquo;s mind wrought so constantly in images, that his coherent
      trains of thought often resembled the significant dreams attributed to
      sleepers by waking persons in their most inventive moments: nay, they
      often resembled genuine dreams in their way of breaking off the passage
      from the known to the unknown. Thus, for a long while, he habitually
      thought of the Being answering to his need as one distantly approaching or
      turning his back toward him, darkly painted against a golden sky. The
      reason of the golden sky lay in one of Mordecai&rsquo;s habits. He was
      keenly alive to some poetic aspects of London; and a favorite resort of
      his, when strength and leisure allowed, was to some of the bridges,
      especially about sunrise or sunset. Even when he was bending over
      watch-wheels and trinkets, or seated in a small upper room looking out on
      dingy bricks and dingy cracked windows, his imagination spontaneously
      planted him on some spot where he had a far-stretching scene; his thoughts
      went on in wide spaces; and whenever he could, he tried to have in reality
      the influences of a large sky. Leaning on the parapet of Blackfriar&rsquo;s
      Bridge, and gazing meditatively, the breadth and calm of the river, with
      its long vista half hazy, half luminous, the grand dim masses of tall
      forms of buildings which were the signs of world-commerce, the oncoming of
      boats and barges from the still distance into sound and color, entered
      into his mood and blent themselves indistinguishably with his thinking, as
      a fine symphony to which we can hardly be said to listen, makes a medium
      that bears up our spiritual wings. Thus it happened that the figure
      representative of Mordecai&rsquo;s longing was mentally seen darkened by
      the excess of light in the aerial background. But in the inevitable
      progress of his imagination toward fuller detail, he ceased to see the
      figure with its back toward him. It began to advance, and a face became
      discernible; the words youth, beauty, refinement, Jewish birth, noble
      gravity, turned into hardly individual but typical form and color:
      gathered from his memory of faces seen among the Jews of Holland and
      Bohemia, and from the paintings which revived that memory. Reverently let
      it be said of this mature spiritual need that it was akin to the boy&rsquo;s
      and girl&rsquo;s picturing of the future beloved; but the stirrings of
      such young desire are feeble compared with the passionate current of an
      ideal life straining to embody itself, made intense by resistance to
      imminent dissolution. The visionary form became a companion and auditor;
      keeping a place not only in the waking imagination, but in those dreams of
      lighter slumber of which it is truest to say, &ldquo;I sleep, but my heart
      waketh&rdquo;&mdash;when the disturbing trivial story of yesterday is
      charged with the impassioned purpose of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of late the urgency of irremediable time, measured by the gradual choking
      of life, had turned Mordecai&rsquo;s trust into an agitated watch for the
      fulfillment that must be at hand. Was the bell on the verge of tolling,
      the sentence about to be executed? The deliverer&rsquo;s footstep must be
      near&mdash;the deliverer who was to rescue Mordecai&rsquo;s spiritual
      travail from oblivion, and give it an abiding-place in the best heritage
      of his people. An insane exaggeration of his own value, even if his ideas
      had been as true and precious as those of Columbus or Newton, many would
      have counted this yearning, taking it as the sublimer part for a man to
      say, &ldquo;If not I, then another,&rdquo; and to hold cheap the meaning
      of his own life. But the fuller nature desires to be an agent, to create,
      and not merely to look on: strong love hungers to bless, and not merely to
      behold blessing. And while there is warmth enough in the sun to feed an
      energetic life, there will still be men to feel, &ldquo;I am lord of this
      moment&rsquo;s change, and will charge it with my soul.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But with that mingling of inconsequence which belongs to us all, and not
      unhappily, since it saves us from many effects of mistake, Mordecai&rsquo;s
      confidence in the friend to come did not suffice to make him passive, and
      he tried expedients, pathetically humble, such as happened to be within
      his reach, for communicating something of himself. It was now two years
      since he had taken up his abode under Ezra Cohen&rsquo;s roof, where he
      was regarded with much good-will as a compound of workman, dominie, vessel
      of charity, inspired idiot, man of piety, and (if he were inquired into)
      dangerous heretic. During that time little Jacob had advanced into
      knickerbockers, and into that quickness of apprehension which has been
      already made manifest in relation to hardware and exchange. He had also
      advanced in attachment to Mordecai, regarding him as an inferior, but
      liking him none the worse, and taking his helpful cleverness as he might
      have taken the services of an enslaved Djinn. As for Mordecai, he had
      given Jacob his first lessons, and his habitual tenderness easily turned
      into the teacher&rsquo;s fatherhood. Though he was fully conscious of the
      spiritual distance between the parents and himself, and would never have
      attempted any communication to them from his peculiar world, the boy moved
      him with that idealizing affection which merges the qualities of the
      individual child in the glory of childhood and the possibilities of a long
      future. And this feeling had drawn him on, at first without premeditation,
      and afterward with conscious purpose, to a sort of outpouring in the ear
      of the boy which might have seemed wild enough to any excellent man of
      business who overheard it. But none overheard when Jacob went up to
      Mordecai&rsquo;s room one day, for example, in which there was little work
      to be done, or at an hour when the work was ended, and after a brief
      lesson in English reading or in numeration, was induced to remain standing
      at his teacher&rsquo;s knees, or chose to jump astride them, often to the
      patient fatigue of the wasted limbs. The inducement was perhaps the
      mending of a toy, or some little mechanical device in which Mordecai&rsquo;s
      well-practiced finger-tips had an exceptional skill; and with the boy thus
      tethered, he would begin to repeat a Hebrew poem of his own, into which
      years before he had poured his first youthful ardors for that conception
      of a blended past and future which was the mistress of his soul, telling
      Jacob to say the words after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boy will get them engraved within him,&rdquo; thought Mordecai;
      &ldquo;it is a way of printing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      None readier than Jacob at this fascinating game of imitating
      unintelligible words; and if no opposing diversion occurred he would
      sometimes carry on his share in it as long as the teacher&rsquo;s breath
      would last out. For Mordecai threw into each repetition the fervor
      befitting a sacred occasion. In such instances, Jacob would show no other
      distraction than reaching out and surveying the contents of his pockets;
      or drawing down the skin of his cheeks to make his eyes look awful, and
      rolling his head to complete the effect; or alternately handling his own
      nose and Mordecai&rsquo;s as if to test the relation of their masses.
      Under all this the fervid reciter would not pause, satisfied if the young
      organs of speech would submit themselves. But most commonly a sudden
      impulse sent Jacob leaping away into some antic or active amusement, when,
      instead of following the recitation he would return upon the foregoing
      words most ready to his tongue, and mouth or gabble, with a see-saw suited
      to the action of his limbs, a verse on which Mordecai had spent some of
      his too scanty heart&rsquo;s blood. Yet he waited with such patience as a
      prophet needs, and began his strange printing again undiscouraged on the
      morrow, saying inwardly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My words may rule him some day. Their meaning may flash out on him.
      It is so with a nation&mdash;after many days.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Jacob&rsquo;s sense of power was increased and his time
      enlivened by a store of magical articulation with which he made the baby
      crow, or drove the large cat into a dark corner, or promised himself to
      frighten any incidental Christian of his own years. One week he had
      unfortunately seen a street mountebank, and this carried off his muscular
      imitativeness in sad divergence from New Hebrew poetry, after the model of
      Jehuda ha-Levi. Mordecai had arrived at a fresh passage in his poem; for
      as soon as Jacob had got well used to one portion, he was led on to
      another, and a fresh combination of sounds generally answered better in
      keeping him fast for a few minutes. The consumptive voice, generally a
      strong high baritone, with its variously mingling hoarseness, like a haze
      amidst illuminations, and its occasional incipient gasp had more than the
      usual excitement, while it gave forth Hebrew verses with a meaning
      something like this:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Away from me the garment of forgetfulness.
  Withering the heart;
  The oil and wine from presses of the Goyim,
  Poisoned with scorn.
  Solitude is on the sides of Mount Nebo,
  In its heart a tomb:
  There the buried ark and golden cherubim
  Make hidden light:
  There the solemn gaze unchanged,
  The wings are spread unbroken:
  Shut beneath in silent awful speech
  The Law lies graven.
  Solitude and darkness are my covering,
  And my heart a tomb;
  Smite and shatter it, O Gabriel!
  Shatter it as the clay of the founder
  Around the golden image.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In the absorbing enthusiasm with which Mordecai had intoned rather than
      spoken this last invocation, he was unconscious that Jacob had ceased to
      follow him and had started away from his knees; but pausing he saw, as by
      a sudden flash, that the lad had thrown himself on his hands with his feet
      in the air, mountebank fashion, and was picking up with his lips a bright
      farthing which was a favorite among his pocket treasures. This might have
      been reckoned among the tricks Mordecai was used to, but at this moment it
      jarred him horribly, as if it had been a Satanic grin upon his prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child! child!&rdquo; he called out with a strange cry that startled
      Jacob to his feet, and then he sank backward with a shudder, closing his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Jacob, quickly. Then, not getting an immediate
      answer, he pressed Mordecai&rsquo;s knees with a shaking movement, in
      order to rouse him. Mordecai opened his eyes with a fierce expression in
      them, leaned forward, grasped the little shoulders, and said in a quick,
      hoarse whisper,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A curse is on your generation, child. They will open the mountain
      and drag forth the golden wings and coin them into money, and the solemn
      faces they will break up into ear-rings for wanton women! And they shall
      get themselves a new name, but the angel of ignominy, with the fiery
      brand, shall know them, and their heart shall be the tomb of dead desires
      that turn their life to rottenness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The aspect and action of Mordecai were so new and mysterious to Jacob&mdash;they
      carried such a burden of obscure threat&mdash;it was as if the patient,
      indulgent companion had turned into something unknown and terrific: the
      sunken dark eyes and hoarse accents close to him, the thin grappling
      fingers, shook Jacob&rsquo;s little frame into awe, and while Mordecai was
      speaking he stood trembling with a sense that the house was tumbling in
      and they were not going to have dinner any more. But when the terrible
      speech had ended and the pinch was relaxed, the shock resolved itself into
      tears; Jacob lifted up his small patriarchal countenance and wept aloud.
      This sign of childish grief at once recalled Mordecai to his usual gentle
      self: he was not able to speak again at present, but with a maternal
      action he drew the curly head toward him and pressed it tenderly against
      his breast. On this Jacob, feeling the danger well-nigh over, howled at
      ease, beginning to imitate his own performance and improve upon it&mdash;a
      sort of transition from impulse into art often observable. Indeed, the
      next day he undertook to terrify Adelaide Rebekah in like manner, and
      succeeded very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mordecai suffered a check which lasted long, from the consciousness of
      a misapplied agitation; sane as well as excitable, he judged severely his
      moments of aberration into futile eagerness, and felt discredited with
      himself. All the more his mind was strained toward the discernment of that
      friend to come, with whom he would have a calm certainty of fellowship and
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just then that, in his usual midday guardianship of the old
      book-shop, he was struck by the appearance of Deronda, and it is perhaps
      comprehensible now why Mordecai&rsquo;s glance took on a sudden eager
      interest as he looked at the new-comer: he saw a face and frame which
      seemed to him to realize the long-conceived type. But the disclaimer of
      Jewish birth was for the moment a backward thrust of double severity, the
      particular disappointment tending to shake his confidence in the more
      indefinite expectation. Nevertheless, when he found Deronda seated at the
      Cohens&rsquo; table, the disclaimer was for the moment nullified: the
      first impression returned with added force, seeming to be guaranteed by
      this second meeting under circumstance more peculiar than the former; and
      in asking Deronda if he knew Hebrew, Mordecai was so possessed by the new
      inrush of belief, that he had forgotten the absence of any other condition
      to the fulfillment of his hopes. But the answering &ldquo;No&rdquo; struck
      them all down again, and the frustration was more painful than before.
      After turning his back on the visitor that Sabbath evening, Mordecai went
      through days of a deep discouragement, like that of men on a doomed ship,
      who having strained their eyes after a sail, and beheld it with rejoicing,
      behold it never advance, and say, &ldquo;Our sick eyes make it.&rdquo; But
      the long-contemplated figure had come as an emotional sequence of Mordecai&rsquo;s
      firmest theoretic convictions; it had been wrought from the imagery of his
      most passionate life; and it inevitably reappeared&mdash;reappeared in a
      more specific self-asserting form than ever. Deronda had that sort of
      resemblance to the preconceived type which a finely individual bust or
      portrait has to the more generalized copy left in our minds after a long
      interval: we renew our memory with delight, but we hardly know with how
      much correction. And now, his face met Mordecai&rsquo;s inward gaze as it
      had always belonged to the awaited friend, raying out, moreover, some of
      that influence which belongs to breathing flesh; till by-and-by it seemed
      that discouragement had turned into a new obstinacy of resistance, and the
      ever-recurrent vision had the force of an outward call to disregard
      counter-evidence, and keep expectation awake. It was Deronda now who was
      seen in the often painful night-watches, when we are all liable to be held
      with the clutch of a single thought&mdash;whose figure, never with its
      back turned, was seen in moments of soothed reverie or soothed dozing,
      painted on that golden sky which was the doubly blessed symbol of
      advancing day and of approaching rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai knew that the nameless stranger was to come and redeem his ring;
      and, in spite of contrary chances, the wish to see him again was growing
      into a belief that he should see him. In the January weeks, he felt an
      increasing agitation of that subdued hidden quality which hinders nervous
      people from any steady occupation on the eve of an anticipated change. He
      could not go on with his printing of Hebrew on little Jacob&rsquo;s mind;
      or with his attendance at a weekly club, which was another effort of the
      same forlorn hope: something else was coming. The one thing he longed for
      was to get as far as the river, which he could do but seldom and with
      difficulty. He yearned with a poet&rsquo;s yearning for the wide sky, the
      far-reaching vista of bridges, the tender and fluctuating lights on the
      water which seems to breathe with a life that can shiver and mourn, be
      comforted and rejoice.

  &ldquo;Vor den Wissenden sich stellen,
  Sicher ist&rsquo;s in allen Fällen!
  Wenn du lange dich gequälet,
  Weiß er gleich, wo dir es fehlet.
  Auch auf Beifall darfst du hoffen;
  Denn er weiß, wo du&rsquo;s getroffen.&rdquo;

           &mdash;GOETHE: <i>West-östlicher Divan</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Momentous things happened to Deronda the very evening of that visit to the
      small house at Chelsea, when there was the discussion about Mirah&rsquo;s
      public name. But for the family group there, what appeared to be the chief
      sequence connected with it occurred two days afterward. About four o&rsquo;clock
      wheels paused before the door, and there came one of those knocks with an
      accompanying ring which serve to magnify the sense of social existence in
      a region where the most enlivening signals are usually those of the
      muffin-man. All the girls were at home, and the two rooms were thrown
      together to make space for Kate&rsquo;s drawing, as well as a great length
      of embroidery which had taken the place of the satin cushions&mdash;a sort
      of <i>pièce de résistance</i> in the courses of needlework, taken up by
      any clever fingers that happened to be at liberty. It stretched across the
      front room picturesquely enough, Mrs. Meyrick bending over it on one
      corner, Mab in the middle, and Amy at the other end. Mirah, whose
      performances in point of sewing were on the make-shift level of the
      tailor-bird&rsquo;s, her education in that branch having been much
      neglected, was acting as reader to the party, seated on a camp-stool; in
      which position she also served Kate as model for a title-page vignette,
      symbolizing a fair public absorbed in the successive volumes of the family
      tea-table. She was giving forth with charming distinctness the delightful
      Essay of Elia, &ldquo;The Praise of Chimney-Sweeps,&rdquo; and all were
      smiling over the &ldquo;innocent blackness,&rdquo; when the imposing knock
      and ring called their thoughts to loftier spheres, and they looked up in
      wonderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick; &ldquo;can it be Lady Mallinger?
      Is there a grand carriage, Amy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;only a hansom cab. It must be a gentleman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prime Minister, I should think,&rdquo; said Kate dryly. &ldquo;Hans
      says the greatest man in London may get into a hansom cab.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo; cried Mab. &ldquo;Suppose it should be Lord
      Russell!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The five bright faces were all looking amused when the old maid-servant
      bringing in a card distractedly left the parlor-door open, and there was
      seen bowing toward Mrs. Meyrick a figure quite unlike that of the
      respected Premier&mdash;tall and physically impressive even in his kid and
      kerseymere, with massive face, flamboyant hair, and gold spectacles: in
      fact, as Mrs. Meyrick saw from the card, <i>Julius Klesmer</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even embarrassment could hardly have made the &ldquo;little mother&rdquo;
      awkward, but quick in her perceptions she was at once aware of the
      situation, and felt well satisfied that the great personage had come to
      Mirah instead of requiring her to come to him; taking it as a sign of
      active interest. But when he entered, the rooms shrank into closets, the
      cottage piano, Mab thought, seemed a ridiculous toy, and the entire family
      existence as petty and private as an establishment of mice in the
      Tuileries. Klesmer&rsquo;s personality, especially his way of glancing
      round him, immediately suggested vast areas and a multitudinous audience,
      and probably they made the usual scenery of his consciousness, for we all
      of us carry on our thinking in some habitual locus where there is a
      presence of other souls, and those who take in a larger sweep than their
      neighbors are apt to seem mightily vain and affected. Klesmer was vain,
      but not more so than many contemporaries of heavy aspect, whose vanity
      leaps out and startles one like a spear out of a walking-stick; as to his
      carriage and gestures, these were as natural to him as the length of his
      fingers; and the rankest affectation he could have shown would have been
      to look diffident and demure. While his grandiose air was making Mab feel
      herself a ridiculous toy to match the cottage piano, he was taking in the
      details around him with a keen and thoroughly kind sensibility. He
      remembered a home no longer than this on the outskirts of Bohemia; and in
      the figurative Bohemia too he had had large acquaintance with the variety
      and romance which belong to small incomes. He addressed Mrs. Meyrick with
      the utmost deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I have not taken too great a freedom. Being in the
      neighborhood, I ventured to save time by calling. Our friend, Mr. Deronda,
      mentioned to me an understanding that I was to have the honor of becoming
      acquainted with a young lady here&mdash;Miss Lapidoth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer had really discerned Mirah in the first moment of entering, but,
      with subtle politeness, he looked round bowingly at the three sisters as
      if he were uncertain which was the young lady in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are my daughters: this is Miss Lapidoth,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Meyrick, waving her hand toward Mirah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Klesmer, in a tone of gratified expectation,
      turning a radiant smile and deep bow to Mirah, who, instead of being in
      the least taken by surprise, had a calm pleasure in her face. She liked
      the look of Klesmer, feeling sure that he would scold her, like a great
      musician and a kind man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not object to beginning our acquaintance by singing to me,&rdquo;
      he added, aware that they would all be relieved by getting rid of
      preliminaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very glad. It is good of you to be willing to listen to
      me,&rdquo; said Mirah, moving to the piano. &ldquo;Shall I accompany
      myself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said Klesmer, seating himself, at Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s
      invitation, where he could have a good view of the singer. The acute
      little mother would not have acknowledged the weakness, but she really
      said to herself, &ldquo;He will like her singing better if he sees her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All the feminine hearts except Mirah&rsquo;s were beating fast with
      anxiety, thinking Klesmer terrific as he sat with his listening frown on,
      and only daring to look at him furtively. If he did say anything severe it
      would be so hard for them all. They could only comfort themselves with
      thinking that Prince Camaralzaman, who had heard the finest things,
      preferred Mirah&rsquo;s singing to any other: also she appeared to be
      doing her very best, as if she were more instead of less at ease than
      usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The song she had chosen was a fine setting of some words selected from
      Leopardi&rsquo;s grand Ode to Italy:,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>O patria mia, vedo le mura c gli archi
  E le colonne e i simula-cri e l&rsquo;erme
  Torridegli avi nostri</i>&rdquo;,
</pre>
    <p>
      This was recitative: then followed,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Ma la gloria&mdash;non vedo</i>&rdquo;,
</pre>
    <p>
      a mournful melody, a rhythmic plaint. After this came a climax of devout
      triumph&mdash;passing from the subdued adoration of a happy Andante in the
      words,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;<i>Beatissimi voi.
  Che offriste il petto alle nemiche lance
  Per amor di costei che al sol vi diede</i>&rdquo;,
</pre>
    <p>
      to the joyous outburst of an exultant Allegro in,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;<i>Oh viva, oh viva:
  Beatissimi voi
  Mentre nel monde si favelli o scriva.</i>&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      When she had ended, Klesmer said after a moment,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is old Leo&rsquo;s music.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was my last master&mdash;at Vienna: so fierce and so good,&rdquo;
      said Mirah, with a melancholy smile. &ldquo;He prophesied that my voice
      would not do for the stage. And he was right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Con</i>tinue, if you please,&rdquo; said Klesmer, putting out
      his lips and shaking his long fingers, while he went on with a smothered
      articulation quite unintelligible to the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three girls detested him unanimously for not saying one word of
      praise. Mrs. Meyrick was a little alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah, simply bent on doing what Klesmer desired, and imagining that he
      would now like to hear her sing some German, went through Prince Radzivill&rsquo;s
      music to Gretchen&rsquo;s songs in the <i>Faust,</i> one after the other
      without any interrogatory pause. When she had finished he rose and walked
      to the extremity of the small space at command, then walked back to the
      piano, where Mirah had risen from her seat and stood looking toward him
      with her little hands crossed before her, meekly awaiting judgment; then
      with a sudden unknitting of his brow and with beaming eyes, he stretched
      out his hand and said abruptly, &ldquo;Let us shake hands: you are a
      musician.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mab felt herself beginning to cry, and all the three girls held Klesmer
      adorable. Mrs. Meyrick took a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      But straightway the frown came again, the long hand, back uppermost, was
      stretched out in quite a different sense to touch with finger-tip the back
      of Mirah&rsquo;s, and with protruded lip he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for great tasks. No high roofs. We are no skylarks. We must be
      modest.&rdquo; Klesmer paused here. And Mab ceased to think him adorable:
      &ldquo;as if Mirah had shown the least sign of conceit!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah was silent, knowing that there was a specific opinion to be waited
      for, and Klesmer presently went on&mdash;&ldquo;I would not advise&mdash;I
      would not further your singing in any larger space than a private
      drawing-room. But you will do there. And here in London that is one of the
      best careers open. Lessons will follow. Will you come and sing at a
      private concert at my house on Wednesday?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I shall be grateful,&rdquo; said Mirah, putting her hands
      together devoutly. &ldquo;I would rather get my bread in that way than by
      anything more public. I will try to improve. What should I work at most?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer made a preliminary answer in noises which sounded like words
      bitten in two and swallowed before they were half out, shaking his fingers
      the while, before he said, quite distinctly, &ldquo;I shall introduce you
      to Astorga: he is the foster-father of good singing and will give you
      advice.&rdquo; Then addressing Mrs. Meyrick, he added, &ldquo;Mrs. Klesmer
      will call before Wednesday, with your permission.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall feel that to be a great kindness,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Meyrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will sing to her,&rdquo; said Klesmer, turning again to Mirah.
      &ldquo;She is a thorough musician, and has a soul with more ears to it
      than you will often get in a musician. Your singing will satisfy her:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Vor den Wissenden sich stellen;&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      you know the rest?&rdquo;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Sicher ist&rsquo;s in alien Fällen.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      said Mirah, promptly. And Klesmer saying &ldquo;Schön!&rdquo; put out his
      hand again as a good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had certainly chosen the most delicate way of praising Mirah, and the
      Meyrick girls had now given him all their esteem. But imagine Mab&rsquo;s
      feeling when suddenly fixing his eyes on her, he said decisively, &ldquo;That
      young lady is musical, I see!&rdquo; She was a mere blush and sense of
      scorching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mirah, on her behalf. &ldquo;And she has a touch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please, Mirah&mdash;a scramble, not a touch,&rdquo; said Mab,
      in anguish, with a horrible fear of what the next thing might be: this
      dreadful divining personage&mdash;evidently Satan in gray trousers&mdash;might
      order her to sit down to the piano, and her heart was like molten wax in
      the midst of her. But this was cheap payment for her amazed joy when
      Klesmer said benignantly, turning to Mrs. Meyrick, &ldquo;Will she like to
      accompany Miss Lapidoth and hear the music on Wednesday?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There could hardly be a greater pleasure for her,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Meyrick. &ldquo;She will be most glad and grateful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Klesmer bowed round to the three sisters more grandly than they
      had ever been bowed to before. Altogether it was an amusing picture&mdash;the
      little room with so much of its diagonal taken up in Klesmer&rsquo;s
      magnificent bend to the small feminine figures like images a little less
      than life-size, the grave Holbein faces on the walls, as many as were not
      otherwise occupied, looking hard at this stranger who by his face seemed a
      dignified contemporary of their own, but whose garments seemed a
      deplorable mockery of the human form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Meyrick could not help going out of the room with Klesmer and closing
      the door behind her. He understood her, and said with a frowning nod,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will do: if she doesn&rsquo;t attempt too much and her voice
      holds out, she can make an income. I know that is the great point: Deronda
      told me. You are taking care of her. She looks like a good girl.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is an angel,&rdquo; said the warm-hearted woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Klesmer, with a playful nod; &ldquo;she is a pretty
      Jewess: the angels must not get the credit of her. But I think she has
      found a guardian angel,&rdquo; he ended, bowing himself out in this
      amiable way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four young creatures had looked at each other mutely till the door
      banged and Mrs. Meyrick re-entered. Then there was an explosion. Mab
      clapped her hands and danced everywhere inconveniently; Mrs. Meyrick
      kissed Mirah and blessed her; Amy said emphatically, &ldquo;We can never
      get her a new dress before Wednesday!&rdquo; and Kate exclaimed, &ldquo;Thank
      heaven my table is not knocked over!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah had reseated herself on the music-stool without speaking, and the
      tears were rolling down her cheeks as she looked at her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, now, Mab!&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick; &ldquo;come and sit down
      reasonably and let us talk?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, let us talk,&rdquo; said Mab, cordially, coming back to her
      low seat and caressing her knees. &ldquo;I am beginning to feel large
      again. Hans said he was coming this afternoon. I wish he had been here&mdash;only
      there would have been no room for him. Mirah, what are you looking sad
      for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too happy,&rdquo; said Mirah. &ldquo;I feel so full of
      gratitude to you all; and he was so very kind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, at last,&rdquo; said Mab, sharply. &ldquo;But he might have
      said something encouraging sooner. I thought him dreadfully ugly when he
      sat frowning, and only said, &lsquo;<i>Con</i>tinue.&rsquo; I hated him
      all the long way from the top of his hair to the toe of his polished boot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Mab; he has a splendid profile,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Now</i>, but not <i>then</i>. I cannot bear people to keep their
      minds bottled up for the sake of letting them off with a pop. They seem to
      grudge making you happy unless they can make you miserable beforehand.
      However, I forgive him everything,&rdquo; said Mab, with a magnanimous
      air, &ldquo;but he has invited me. I wonder why he fixed on me as the
      musical one? Was it because I have a bulging forehead, ma, and peep from
      under it like a newt from under a stone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was your way of listening to the singing, child,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Meyrick. &ldquo;He has magic spectacles and sees everything through
      them, depend upon it. But what was that German quotation you were so ready
      with, Mirah&mdash;you learned puss?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was not learning,&rdquo; said Mirah, her tearful face
      breaking into an amused smile. &ldquo;I said it so many times for a
      lesson. It means that it is safer to do anything&mdash;singing or anything
      else&mdash;before those who know and understand all about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was why you were not one bit frightened, I suppose,&rdquo;
      said Amy. &ldquo;But now, what we have to talk about is a dress for you on
      Wednesday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything better than this black merino,&rdquo;
      said Mirah, rising to show the effect. &ldquo;Some white gloves and some
      new <i>bottines</i>.&rdquo; She put out her little foot, clad in the
      famous felt slipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There comes Hans,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick. &ldquo;Stand still, and
      let us hear what he says about the dress. Artists are the best people to
      consult about such things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t consult me, ma,&rdquo; said Kate, lifting up her
      eyebrow with a playful complainingness. &ldquo;I notice mothers are like
      the people I deal with&mdash;the girls&rsquo; doings are always priced
      low.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, the boys are such a trouble&mdash;we could never put
      up with them, if we didn&rsquo;t make believe they were worth more,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Meyrick, just as her boy entered. &ldquo;Hans, we want your
      opinion about Mirah&rsquo;s dress. A great event has happened. Klesmer has
      been here, and she is going to sing at his house on Wednesday among grand
      people. She thinks this dress will do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Hans. Mirah in her childlike way turned
      toward him to be looked at; and he, going to a little further distance,
      knelt with one knee on a hassock to survey her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This would be thought a very good stage-dress for me,&rdquo; she
      said, pleadingly, &ldquo;in a part where I was to come on as a poor Jewess
      and sing to fashionable Christians.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be effective,&rdquo; said Hans, with a considering air;
      &ldquo;it would stand out well among the fashionable <i>chiffons</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you ought not to claim all the poverty on your side, Mirah,&rdquo;
      said Amy. &ldquo;There are plenty of poor Christians and dreadfully rich
      Jews and fashionable Jewesses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean any harm,&rdquo; said Mirah. &ldquo;Only I have
      been used to thinking about my dress for parts in plays. And I almost
      always had a part with a plain dress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes me think it questionable,&rdquo; said Hans, who had
      suddenly become as fastidious and conventional on this occasion as he had
      thought Deronda was, apropos of the Berenice-pictures. &ldquo;It looks a
      little too theatrical. We must not make you a <i>rôle</i> of the poor
      Jewess&mdash;or of being a Jewess at all.&rdquo; Hans had a secret desire
      to neutralize the Jewess in private life, which he was in danger of not
      keeping secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is what I am really. I am not pretending anything. I shall
      never be anything else,&rdquo; said Mirah. &ldquo;I always feel myself a
      Jewess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t feel that about you,&rdquo; said Hans, with a
      devout look. &ldquo;What does it signify whether a perfect woman is a
      Jewess or not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is your kind way of praising me; I never was praised so
      before,&rdquo; said Mirah, with a smile, which was rather maddening to
      Hans and made him feel still more of a cosmopolitan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t think of me as a British Christian,&rdquo; he
      said, his face creasing merrily. &ldquo;They think of me as an imperfectly
      handsome young man and an unpromising painter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are wandering from the dress,&rdquo; said Amy. &ldquo;If
      that will not do, how are we to get another before Wednesday? and
      to-morrow Sunday?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed this will do,&rdquo; said Mirah, entreatingly. &ldquo;It is
      all real, you know,&rdquo; here she looked at Hans&mdash;&ldquo;even if it
      seemed theatrical. Poor Berenice sitting on the ruins&mdash;any one might
      say that was theatrical, but I know that this is just what she would do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a scoundrel,&rdquo; said Hans, overcome by this misplaced
      trust. &ldquo;That is my invention. Nobody knows that she did that. Shall
      you forgive me for not saying so before?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mirah, after a momentary pause of surprise.
      &ldquo;You knew it was what she would be sure to do&mdash;a Jewess who had
      not been faithful&mdash;who had done what she did and was penitent. She
      could have no joy but to afflict herself; and where else would she go? I
      think it is very beautiful that you should enter so into what a Jewess
      would feel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Jewesses of that time sat on ruins,&rdquo; said Hans, starting
      up with a sense of being checkmated. &ldquo;That makes them convenient for
      pictures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the dress&mdash;the dress,&rdquo; said Amy; &ldquo;is it
      settled?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; is it not?&rdquo; said Mirah, looking doubtfully at Mrs.
      Meyrick, who in her turn looked up at her son, and said, &ldquo;What do
      you think, Hans?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That dress will not do,&rdquo; said Hans, decisively. &ldquo;She is
      not going to sit on ruins. You must jump into a cab with her, little
      mother, and go to Regent Street. It&rsquo;s plenty of time to get anything
      you like&mdash;a black silk dress such as ladies wear. She must not be
      taken for an object of charity. She has talents to make people indebted to
      her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is what Mr. Deronda would like&mdash;for her to have a
      handsome dress,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick, deliberating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; said Hans, with some sharpness. &ldquo;You
      may take my word for what a gentleman would feel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to do what Mr. Deronda would like me to do,&rdquo; said
      Mirah, gravely, seeing that Mrs. Meyrick looked toward her; and Hans,
      turning on his heel, went to Kate&rsquo;s table and took up one of her
      drawings as if his interest needed a new direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you like to make a study of Klesmer&rsquo;s head,
      Hans?&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;I suppose you have often seen him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen him!&rdquo; exclaimed Hans, immediately throwing back his head
      and mane, seating himself at the piano and looking round him as if he were
      surveying an amphitheatre, while he held his fingers down perpendicularly
      toward the keys. But then in another instant he wheeled round on the
      stool, looked at Mirah and said, half timidly&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t
      like this mimicry; you must always stop my nonsense when you don&rsquo;t
      like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah had been smiling at the swiftly-made image, and she smiled still,
      but with a touch of something else than amusement, as she said&mdash;&ldquo;Thank
      you. But you have never done anything I did not like. I hardly think he
      could, belonging to you,&rdquo; she added, looking at Mrs. Meyrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way Hans got food for his hope. How could the rose help it when
      several bees in succession took its sweet odor as a sign of personal
      attachment?

      CHAPTER XL.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Within the soul a faculty abides,
  That with interpositions, which would hide
  And darken, so can deal, that they become
  Contingencies of pomp; and serve to exalt
  Her native brightness, as the ample moon,
  In the deep stillness of a summer even,
  Rising behind a thick and lofty grove,
  Burns, like an unconsuming fire of light,
  In the green trees; and, kindling on all sides
  Their leafy umbrage, turns the dusky veil
  Into a substance glorious as her own,
  Yea, with her own incorporated, by power
  Capacious and serene.&rdquo;
                &mdash;WORDSWORTH: <i>Excursion</i>, B. IV.
</pre>
    <p>
      Deronda came out of the narrow house at Chelsea in a frame of mind that
      made him long for some good bodily exercise to carry off what he was
      himself inclined to call the fumes of his temper. He was going toward the
      city, and the sight of the Chelsea Stairs with the waiting boats at once
      determined him to avoid the irritating inaction of being driven in a cab,
      by calling a wherry and taking an oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      His errand was to go to Ram&rsquo;s book-shop, where he had yesterday
      arrived too late for Mordecai&rsquo;s midday watch, and had been told that
      he invariably came there again between five and six. Some further
      acquaintance with this remarkable inmate of the Cohens was particularly
      desired by Deronda as a preliminary to redeeming his ring: he wished that
      their conversation should not again end speedily with that drop of
      Mordecai&rsquo;s interest which was like the removal of a drawbridge, and
      threatened to shut out any easy communication in future. As he got warmed
      with the use of the oar, fixing his mind on the errand before him and the
      ends he wanted to achieve on Mirah&rsquo;s account, he experienced, as was
      wont with him, a quick change of mental light, shifting his point of view
      to that of the person whom he had been thinking of hitherto chiefly as
      serviceable to his own purposes, and was inclined to taunt himself with
      being not much better than an enlisting sergeant, who never troubles
      himself with the drama that brings him the needful recruits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose if I got from this man the information I am most anxious
      about,&rdquo; thought Deronda, &ldquo;I should be contented enough if he
      felt no disposition to tell me more of himself, or why he seemed to have
      some expectation from me which was disappointed. The sort of curiosity he
      stirs would die out; and yet it might be that he had neared and parted as
      one can imagine two ships doing, each freighted with an exile who would
      have recognized the other if the two could have looked out face to face.
      Not that there is any likelihood of a peculiar tie between me and this
      poor fellow, whose voyage, I fancy, must soon be over. But I wonder
      whether there is much of that momentous mutual missing between people who
      interchange blank looks, or even long for one another&rsquo;s absence in a
      crowded place. However, one makes one&rsquo;s self chances of missing by
      going on the recruiting sergeant&rsquo;s plan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the wherry was approaching Blackfriars Bridge, where Deronda meant to
      land, it was half-past four, and the gray day was dying gloriously, its
      western clouds all broken into narrowing purple strata before a
      wide-spreading saffron clearness, which in the sky had a monumental calm,
      but on the river, with its changing objects, was reflected as a luminous
      movement, the alternate flash of ripples or currents, the sudden glow of
      the brown sail, the passage of laden barges from blackness into color,
      making an active response to that brooding glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling well heated by this time, Deronda gave up the oar and drew over
      him again his Inverness cape. As he lifted up his head while fastening the
      topmost button his eyes caught a well-remembered face looking toward him
      over the parapet of the bridge&mdash;brought out by the western light into
      startling distinctness and brilliancy&mdash;an illuminated type of bodily
      emaciation and spiritual eagerness. It was the face of Mordecai, who also,
      in his watch toward the west, had caught sight of the advancing boat, and
      had kept it fast within his gaze, at first simply because it was
      advancing, then with a recovery of impressions that made him quiver as
      with a presentiment, till at last the nearing figure lifted up its face
      toward him&mdash;the face of his visions&mdash;and then immediately, with
      white uplifted hand, beckoned again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Deronda, anxious that Mordecai should recognize and await him, had
      lost no time before signaling, and the answer came straightway. Mordecai
      lifted his cap and waved it&mdash;feeling in that moment that his inward
      prophecy was fulfilled. Obstacles, incongruities, all melted into the
      sense of completion with which his soul was flooded by this outward
      satisfaction of his longing. His exultation was not widely different from
      that of the experimenter, bending over the first stirrings of change that
      correspond to what in the fervor of concentrated prevision his thought has
      foreshadowed. The prefigured friend had come from the golden background,
      and had signaled to him: this actually was: the rest was to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three minutes Deronda had landed, had paid his boatman, and was joining
      Mordecai, whose instinct it was to stand perfectly still and wait for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very glad to see you standing here,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      &ldquo;for I was intending to go on to the book-shop and look for you
      again. I was there yesterday&mdash;perhaps they mentioned it to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mordecai; &ldquo;that was the reason I came to the
      bridge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This answer, made with simple gravity, was startlingly mysterious to
      Deronda. Were the peculiarities of this man really associated with any
      sort of mental alienation, according to Cohen&rsquo;s hint?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew nothing of my being at Chelsea?&rdquo; he said, after a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I expected you to come down the river. I have been waiting
      for you these five years.&rdquo; Mordecai&rsquo;s deep-sunk eyes were
      fixed on those of the friend who had at last arrived with a look of
      affectionate dependence, at once pathetic and solemn. Deronda&rsquo;s
      sensitiveness was not the less responsive because he could not but believe
      that this strangely-disclosed relation was founded on an illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a satisfaction to me if I can be of any real use to you,&rdquo;
      he answered, very earnestly. &ldquo;Shall we get into a cab and drive to&mdash;wherever
      you wish to go? You have probably had walking enough with your short
      breath.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go to the book-shop. It will soon be time for me to be
      there. But now look up the river,&rdquo; said Mordecai, turning again
      toward it and speaking in undertones of what may be called an excited calm&mdash;so
      absorbed by a sense of fulfillment that he was conscious of no barrier to
      a complete understanding between him and Deronda. &ldquo;See the sky, how
      it is slowly fading. I have always loved this bridge: I stood on it when I
      was a little boy. It is a meeting-place for the spiritual messengers. It
      is true&mdash;what the Masters said&mdash;that each order of things has
      its angel: that means the full message of each from what is afar. Here I
      have listened to the messages of earth and sky; when I was stronger I used
      to stay and watch for the stars in the deep heavens. But this time just
      about sunset was always what I loved best. It has sunk into me and dwelt
      with me&mdash;fading, slowly fading: it was my own decline: it paused&mdash;it
      waited, till at last it brought me my new life&mdash;my new self&mdash;who
      will live when this breath is all breathed out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda did not speak. He felt himself strangely wrought upon. The
      first-prompted suspicion that Mordecai might be liable to hallucinations
      of thought&mdash;might have become a monomaniac on some subject which had
      given too severe a strain to his diseased organism&mdash;gave way to a
      more submissive expectancy. His nature was too large, too ready to
      conceive regions beyond his own experience, to rest at once in the easy
      explanation, &ldquo;madness,&rdquo; whenever a consciousness showed some
      fullness and conviction where his own was blank. It accorded with his
      habitual disposition that he should meet rather than resist any claim on
      him in the shape of another&rsquo;s need; and this claim brought with it a
      sense of solemnity which seemed a radiation from Mordecai, as utterly
      nullifying his outward poverty and lifting him into authority as if he had
      been that preternatural guide seen in the universal legend, who suddenly
      drops his mean disguise and stands a manifest Power. That impression was
      the more sanctioned by a sort of resolved quietude which the persuasion of
      fulfillment had produced in Mordecai&rsquo;s manner. After they had stood
      a moment in silence he said, &ldquo;Let us go now,&rdquo; and when they
      were riding he added, &ldquo;We will get down at the end of the street and
      walk to the shop. You can look at the books, and Mr. Ram will be going
      away directly and leave us alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that this enthusiast was just as cautious, just as much alive to
      judgments in other minds as if he had been that antipode of all enthusiasm
      called &ldquo;a man of the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were rattling along in the cab, Mirah was still present with
      Deronda in the midst of this strange experience, but he foresaw that the
      course of conversation would be determined by Mordecai, not by himself: he
      was no longer confident what questions he should be able to ask; and with
      a reaction on his own mood, he inwardly said, &ldquo;I suppose I am in a
      state of complete superstition, just as if I were awaiting the destiny
      that could interpret the oracle. But some strong relation there must be
      between me and this man, since he feels it strongly. Great heaven! what
      relation has proved itself more potent in the world than faith even when
      mistaken&mdash;than expectation even when perpetually disappointed? Is my
      side of the relation to be disappointing or fulfilling?&mdash;well, if it
      is ever possible for me to fulfill I will not disappoint.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In ten minutes the two men, with as intense a consciousness as if they had
      been two undeclared lovers, felt themselves alone in the small gas-lit
      book-shop and turned face to face, each baring his head from an
      instinctive feeling that they wished to see each other fully. Mordecai
      came forward to lean his back against the little counter, while Deronda
      stood against the opposite wall hardly more than four feet off. I wish I
      could perpetuate those two faces, as Titian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tribute Money&rdquo;
      has perpetuated two types presenting another sort of contrast. Imagine&mdash;we
      all of us can&mdash;the pathetic stamp of consumption with its brilliancy
      of glance to which the sharply-defined structure of features reminding one
      of a forsaken temple, give already a far-off look as of one getting
      unwillingly out of reach; and imagine it on a Jewish face naturally
      accentuated for the expression of an eager mind&mdash;the face of a man
      little above thirty, but with that age upon it which belongs to time
      lengthened by suffering, the hair and beard, still black, throwing out the
      yellow pallor of the skin, the difficult breathing giving more decided
      marking to the mobile nostril, the wasted yellow hands conspicuous on the
      folded arms: then give to the yearning consumptive glance something of the
      slowly dying mother&rsquo;s look, when her one loved son visits her
      bedside, and the flickering power of gladness leaps out as she says,
      &ldquo;My boy!&rdquo;&mdash;for the sense of spiritual perpetuation in
      another resembles that maternal transference of self.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing such a portrait you would see Mordecai. And opposite to him was a
      face not more distinctively oriental than many a type seen among what we
      call the Latin races; rich in youthful health, and with a forcible
      masculine gravity in its repose, that gave the value of judgment to the
      reverence with which he met the gaze of this mysterious son of poverty who
      claimed him as a long-expected friend. The more exquisite quality of
      Deronda&rsquo;s nature&mdash;that keenly perceptive sympathetic
      emotiveness which ran along with his speculative tendency&mdash;was never
      more thoroughly tested. He felt nothing that could be called belief in the
      validity of Mordecai&rsquo;s impressions concerning him or in the
      probability of any greatly effective issue: what he felt was a profound
      sensibility to a cry from the depths of another and accompanying that, the
      summons to be receptive instead of superciliously prejudging.
      Receptiveness is a rare and massive power, like fortitude; and this state
      of mind now gave Deronda&rsquo;s face its utmost expression of calm
      benignant force&mdash;an expression which nourished Mordecai&rsquo;s
      confidence and made an open way before him. He began to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot know what has guided me to you and brought us together
      at this moment. You are wondering.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not impatient,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;I am ready to
      listen to whatever you may wish to disclose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see some of the reasons why I needed you,&rdquo; said Mordecai,
      speaking quietly, as if he wished to reserve his strength. &ldquo;You see
      that I am dying. You see that I am as one shut up behind bars by the
      wayside, who if he spoke to any would be met only by head-shaking and
      pity. The day is closing&mdash;the light is fading&mdash;soon we should
      not have been able to discern each other. But you have come in time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rejoice that I am come in time,&rdquo; said Deronda, feelingly.
      He would not say, &ldquo;I hope you are not mistaken in me,&rdquo;&mdash;the
      very word &ldquo;mistaken,&rdquo; he thought, would be a cruelty at that
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the hidden reasons why I need you began afar off,&rdquo; said
      Mordecai; &ldquo;began in my early years when I was studying in another
      land. Then ideas, beloved ideas, came to me, because I was a Jew. They
      were a trust to fulfill, because I was a Jew. They were an inspiration,
      because I was a Jew, and felt the heart of my race beating within me. They
      were my life; I was not fully born till then. I counted this heart, and
      this breath, and this right hand&rdquo;&mdash;Mordecai had pathetically
      pressed his hand upon his breast, and then stretched its wasted fingers
      out before him&mdash;&ldquo;I counted my sleep and my waking, and the work
      I fed my body with, and the sights that fed my eyes&mdash;I counted them
      but as fuel to the divine flame. But I had done as one who wanders and
      engraves his thought in rocky solitudes, and before I could change my
      course came care and labor and disease, and blocked the way before me, and
      bound me with the iron that eats itself into the soul. Then I said,
      &lsquo;How shall I save the life within me from being stifled with this
      stifled breath?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai paused to rest that poor breath which had been taxed by the
      rising excitement of his speech. And also he wished to check that
      excitement. Deronda dared not speak: the very silence in the narrow space
      seemed alive with mingled awe and compassion before this struggling
      fervor. And presently Mordecai went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you may misunderstand me. I speak not as an ignorant dreamer&mdash;as
      one bred up in the inland valleys, thinking ancient thoughts anew, and not
      knowing them ancient, never having stood by the great waters where the
      world&rsquo;s knowledge passes to and fro. English is my mother-tongue,
      England is the native land of this body, which is but as a breaking pot of
      earth around the fruit-bearing tree, whose seed might make the desert
      rejoice. But my true life was nourished in Holland at the feet of my
      mother&rsquo;s brother, a Rabbi skilled in special learning: and when he
      died I went to Hamburg to study, and afterwards to Göttingen, that I might
      take a larger outlook on my people, and on the Gentile world, and drank
      knowledge at all sources. I was a youth; I felt free; I saw our chief
      seats in Germany; I was not then in utter poverty. And I had possessed
      myself of a handicraft. For I said, I care not if my lot be as that of
      Joshua ben Chananja: after the last destruction he earned his bread by
      making needles, but in his youth he had been a singer on the steps of the
      Temple, and had a memory of what was before the glory departed. I said,
      let my body dwell in poverty, and my hands be as the hands of the toiler:
      but let my soul be as a temple of remembrance where the treasures of
      knowledge enter and the inner sanctuary is hope. I knew what I chose. They
      said, &lsquo;He feeds himself on visions,&rsquo; and I denied not; for
      visions are the creators and feeders of the world. I see, I measure the
      world as it is, which the vision will create anew. You are not listening
      to one who raves aloof from the lives of his fellows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai paused, and Deronda, feeling that the pause was expectant, said,
      &ldquo;Do me the justice to believe that I was not inclined to call your
      words raving. I listen that I may know, without prejudgment. I have had
      experience which gives me a keen interest in the story of a spiritual
      destiny embraced willingly, and embraced in youth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A spiritual destiny embraced willingly&mdash;in youth?&rdquo;
      Mordecai repeated in a corrective tone. &ldquo;It was the soul fully born
      within me, and it came in my boyhood. It brought its own world&mdash;a
      mediaeval world, where there are men who made the ancient language live
      again in new psalms of exile. They had absorbed the philosophy of the
      Gentile into the faith of the Jew, and they still yearned toward a center
      for our race. One of their souls was born again within me, and awakened
      amid the memories of their world. It traveled into Spain and Provence; it
      debated with Aben-Ezra; it took ship with Jehuda ha-Levi; it heard the
      roar of the Crusaders and the shrieks of tortured Israel. And when its
      dumb tongue was loosed, it spoke the speech they had made alive with the
      new blood of their ardor, their sorrow, and their martyred trust: it sang
      with the cadence of their strain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai paused again, and then said in a loud, hoarse whisper,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While it is imprisoned in me, it will never learn another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you written entirely in Hebrew, then?&rdquo; said Deronda,
      remembering with some anxiety the former question as to his own knowledge
      of that tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said Mordecai, in a tone of deep sadness:
      &ldquo;in my youth I wandered toward that solitude, not feeling that it
      was a solitude. I had the ranks of the great dead around me; the martyrs
      gathered and listened. But soon I found that the living were deaf to me.
      At first I saw my life spread as a long future: I said part of my Jewish
      heritage is an unbreaking patience; part is skill to seek divers methods
      and find a rooting-place where the planters despair. But there came new
      messengers from the Eternal. I had to bow under the yoke that presses on
      the great multitude born of woman: family troubles called me&mdash;I had
      to work, to care, not for myself alone. I was left solitary again; but
      already the angel of death had turned to me and beckoned, and I felt his
      skirts continually on my path. I loosed not my effort. I besought hearing
      and help. I spoke; I went to men of our people&mdash;to the rich in
      influence or knowledge, to the rich in other wealth. But I found none to
      listen with understanding. I was rebuked for error; I was offered a small
      sum in charity. No wonder. I looked poor; I carried a bundle of Hebrew
      manuscript with me; I said, our chief teachers are misleading the hope of
      our race. Scholar and merchant were both too busy to listen. Scorn stood
      as interpreter between me and them. One said, &lsquo;The book of Mormon
      would never have answered in Hebrew; and if you mean to address our
      learned men, it is not likely you can teach them anything.&rsquo; He
      touched a truth there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The last words had a perceptible irony in their hoarsened tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But though you had accustomed yourself to write in Hebrew, few,
      surely, can use English better,&rdquo; said Deronda, wanting to hint
      consolation in a new effort for which he could smooth the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai shook his head slowly, and answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late&mdash;too late. I can write no more. My writing would be
      like this gasping breath. But the breath may wake the fount of pity&mdash;the
      writing not. If I could write now and used English, I should be as one who
      beats a board to summon those who have been used to no signal but a bell.
      My soul has an ear to hear the faults of its own speech. New writing of
      mine would be like this body&rdquo;&mdash;Mordecai spread his arms&mdash;&ldquo;within
      it there might be the Ruach-ha-kodesh&mdash;the breath of divine thought&mdash;but,
      men would smile at it and say, &lsquo;A poor Jew!&rsquo; and the chief
      smilers would be of my own people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai let his hands fall, and his head sink in melancholy: for the
      moment he had lost hold of his hope. Despondency, conjured up by his own
      words, had floated in and hovered above him with eclipsing wings. He had
      sunk into momentary darkness,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel with you&mdash;I feel strongly with you,&rdquo; said
      Deronda, in a clear deep voice which was itself a cordial, apart from the
      words of sympathy. &ldquo;But forgive me if I speak hastily&mdash;for what
      you have actually written there need be no utter burial. The means of
      publication are within reach. If you will rely on me, I can assure you of
      all that is necessary to that end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not enough,&rdquo; said Mordecai, quickly, looking up again
      with the flash of recovered memory and confidence. &ldquo;That is not all
      my trust in you. You must be not only a hand to me, but a soul&mdash;believing
      my belief&mdash;being moved by my reasons&mdash;hoping my hope&mdash;seeing
      the vision I point to&mdash;beholding a glory where I behold it!&rdquo;&mdash;Mordecai
      had taken a step nearer as he spoke, and now laid his hand on Deronda&rsquo;s
      arm with a tight grasp; his face little more than a foot off had something
      like a pale flame in it&mdash;an intensity of reliance that acted as a
      peremptory claim, while he went on&mdash;&ldquo;You will be my life: it
      will be planted afresh; it will grow. You shall take the inheritance; it
      has been gathering for ages. The generations are crowding on my narrow
      life as a bridge: what has been and what is to be are meeting there; and
      the bridge is breaking. But I have found you. You have come in time. You
      will take the inheritance which the base son refuses because of the tombs
      which the plow and harrow may not pass over or the gold-seeker disturb:
      you will take the sacred inheritance of the Jew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda had become as pallid as Mordecai. Quick as an alarm of flood or
      fire, there spread within him not only a compassionate dread of
      discouraging this fellowman who urged a prayer as one in the last agony,
      but also the opposing dread of fatally feeding an illusion, and being
      hurried on to a self-committal which might turn into a falsity. The
      peculiar appeal to his tenderness overcame the repulsion that most of us
      experience under a grasp and speech which assumed to dominate. The
      difficulty to him was to inflict the accents of hesitation and doubt on
      this ardent suffering creature, who was crowding too much of his brief
      being into a moment of perhaps extravagant trust. With exquisite instinct,
      Deronda, before he opened his lips, placed his palm gently on Mordecai&rsquo;s
      straining hand&mdash;an act just then equal to many speeches. And after
      that he said, without haste, as if conscious that he might be wrong,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you forget what I told you when we first saw each other? Do you
      remember that I said I was not of your race?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be true,&rdquo; Mordecai whispered immediately, with
      no sign of shock. The sympathetic hand still upon him had fortified the
      feeling which was stronger than those words of denial. There was a
      perceptible pause, Deronda feeling it impossible to answer, conscious
      indeed that the assertion &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be true&rdquo;&mdash;had
      the pressure of argument for him. Mordecai, too entirely possessed by the
      supreme importance of the relation between himself and Deronda to have any
      other care in his speech, followed up that assertion by a second, which
      came to his lips as a mere sequence of his long-cherished conviction&mdash;&ldquo;You
      are not sure of your own origin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; said Daniel, with an habitual
      shrinking which made him remove his hands from Mordecai&rsquo;s, who also
      relaxed his hold, and fell back into his former leaning position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it&mdash;I know it; what is my life else?&rdquo; said
      Mordecai, with a low cry of impatience. &ldquo;Tell me everything: tell me
      why you deny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He could have no conception what that demand was to the hearer&mdash;how
      probingly it touched the hidden sensibility, the vividly conscious
      reticence of years; how the uncertainty he was insisting on as part of his
      own hope had always for Daniel been a threatening possibility of painful
      revelation about his mother. But the moment had influences which were not
      only new but solemn to Deronda; any evasion here might turn out to be a
      hateful refusal of some task that belonged to him, some act of due
      fellowship; in any case it would be a cruel rebuff to a being who was
      appealing to him as a forlorn hope under the shadow of a coming doom.
      After a few moments, he said, with a great effort over himself&mdash;determined
      to tell all the truth briefly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never known my mother. I have no knowledge about her. I have
      never called any man father. But I am convinced that my father is an
      Englishman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda&rsquo;s deep tones had a tremor in them as he uttered this
      confession; and all the while there was an undercurrent of amazement in
      him at the strange circumstances under which he uttered it. It seemed as
      if Mordecai were hardly overrating his own power to determine the action
      of the friend whom he had mysteriously chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be seen&mdash;it will be declared,&rdquo; said Mordecai,
      triumphantly. &ldquo;The world grows, and its frame is knit together by
      the growing soul; dim, dim at first, then clearer and more clear, the
      consciousness discerns remote stirrings. As thoughts move within us
      darkly, and shake us before they are fully discerned&mdash;so events&mdash;so
      beings: they are knit with us in the growth of the world. You have risen
      within me like a thought not fully spelled; my soul is shaken before the
      words are all there. The rest will come&mdash;it will come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must not lose sight of the fact that the outward event has not
      always been a fulfillment of the firmest faith,&rdquo; said Deronda, in a
      tone that was made hesitating by the painfully conflicting desires, not to
      give any severe blow to Mordecai, and not to give his confidence a
      sanction which might have the severest of blows in reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai&rsquo;s face, which had been illuminated to the utmost in that
      last declaration of his confidence, changed under Deronda&rsquo;s words,
      not only into any show of collapsed trust: the force did not disappear
      from the expression, but passed from the triumphant into the firmly
      resistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would remind me that I may be under an illusion&mdash;that the
      history of our people&rsquo;s trust has been full of illusion. I face it
      all.&rdquo; Here Mordecai paused a moment. Then bending his head a little
      forward, he said, in his hoarse whisper, &ldquo;<i>So it might be with my
      trust, if you would make it an illusion. But you will not.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The very sharpness with which these words penetrated Deronda made him feel
      the more that here was a crisis in which he must be firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What my birth was does not lie in my will,&rdquo; he answered.
      &ldquo;My sense of claims on me cannot be independent of my knowledge
      there. And I cannot promise you that I will try to hasten a disclosure.
      Feelings which have struck root through half my life may still hinder me
      from doing what I have never been able to do. Everything must be waited
      for. I must know more of the truth about my own life, and I must know more
      of what it would become if it were made a part of yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai had folded his arms again while Deronda was speaking, and now
      answered with equal firmness, though with difficult breathing,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>shall</i> know. What are we met for, but that you should
      know. Your doubts lie as light as dust on my belief. I know the
      philosophies of this time and of other times; if I chose I could answer a
      summons before their tribunals. I could silence the beliefs which are the
      mother-tongue of my soul and speak with the rote-learned language of a
      system, that gives you the spelling of all things, sure of its alphabet
      covering them all. I could silence them: may not a man silence his awe or
      his love, and take to finding reasons, which others demand? But if his
      love lies deeper than any reasons to be found? Man finds his pathways: at
      first they were foot tracks, as those of the beast in the wilderness: now
      they are swift and invisible: his thought dives through the ocean, and his
      wishes thread the air: has he found all the pathways yet? What reaches
      him, stays with him, rules him: he must accept it, not knowing its
      pathway. Say, my expectation of you has grown but as false hopes grow.
      That doubt is in your mind? Well, my expectation was there, and you are
      come. Men have died of thirst. But I was thirsty, and the water is on my
      lips! What are doubts to me? In the hour when you come to me and say,
      &lsquo;I reject your soul: I know that I am not a Jew: we have no lot in
      common&rsquo;&mdash;I shall not doubt. I shall be certain&mdash;certain
      that I have been deluded. That hour will never come!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda felt a new chord sounding in his speech: it was rather imperious
      than appealing&mdash;had more of conscious power than of the yearning need
      which had acted as a beseeching grasp on him before. And usually, though
      he was the reverse of pugnacious, such a change of attitude toward him
      would have weakened his inclination to admit a claim. But here there was
      something that balanced his resistance and kept it aloof. This strong man
      whose gaze was sustainedly calm and his finger-nails pink with health, who
      was exercised in all questioning, and accused of excessive mental
      independence, still felt a subduing influence over him in the tenacious
      certitude of the fragile creature before him, whose pallid yellow nostril
      was tense with effort as his breath labored under the burthen of eager
      speech. The influence seemed to strengthen the bond of sympathetic
      obligation. In Deronda at this moment the desire to escape what might turn
      into a trying embarrassment was no more likely to determine action than
      the solicitations of indolence are likely to determine it in one with whom
      industry is a daily law. He answered simply,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my wish to meet and satisfy your wishes wherever that is
      possible to me. It is certain to me at least that I desire not to
      undervalue your toil and your suffering. Let me know your thoughts. But
      where can we meet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of that,&rdquo; said Mordecai. &ldquo;It is not hard
      for you to come into this neighborhood later in the evening? You did so
      once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can manage it very well occasionally,&rdquo; said Deronda.
      &ldquo;You live under the same roof with the Cohens, I think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Mordecai could answer, Mr. Ram re-entered to take his place behind
      the counter. He was an elderly son of Abraham, whose childhood had fallen
      on the evil times at the beginning of this century, and who remained amid
      this smart and instructed generation as a preserved specimen, soaked
      through and through with the effect of the poverty and contempt which were
      the common heritage of most English Jews seventy years ago. He had none of
      the oily cheerfulness observable in Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s aspect: his very
      features&mdash;broad and chubby&mdash;showed that tendency to look mongrel
      without due cause, which, in a miscellaneous London neighborhood, may
      perhaps be compared with the marvels of imitation in insects, and may have
      been nature&rsquo;s imperfect effort on behalf of the pure Caucasian to
      shield him from the shame and spitting to which purer features would have
      been exposed in the times of zeal. Mr. Ram dealt ably in books, in the
      same way that he would have dealt in tins of meat and other commodities&mdash;without
      knowledge or responsibility as to the proportion of rottenness or
      nourishment they might contain. But he believed in Mordecai&rsquo;s
      learning as something marvellous, and was not sorry that his conversation
      should be sought by a bookish gentleman, whose visits had twice ended in a
      purchase. He greeted Deronda with a crabbed good-will, and, putting on
      large silver spectacles, appeared at once to abstract himself in the daily
      accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Deronda and Mordecai were soon in the street together, and without any
      explicit agreement as to their direction, were walking toward Ezra Cohen&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t meet there: my room is too narrow,&rdquo; said
      Mordecai, taking up the thread of talk where they had dropped it. &ldquo;But
      there is a tavern not far from here where I sometimes go to a club. It is
      the <i>Hand and Banner</i>, in the street at the next turning, five doors
      down. We can have the parlor there any evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can try that for once,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;But you will
      perhaps let me provide you with some lodging, which would give you more
      freedom and comfort than where you are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I need nothing. My outer life is as nought. I will take nothing
      less precious from you than your soul&rsquo;s brotherhood. I will think of
      nothing else yet. But I am glad you are rich. You did not need money on
      that diamond ring. You had some other motive for bringing it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda was a little startled by this clear-sightedness; but before he
      could reply Mordecai added&mdash;&ldquo;it is all one. Had you been in
      need of the money, the great end would have been that we should meet
      again. But you are rich?&rdquo; he ended, in a tone of interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not rich, except in the sense that every one is rich who has more
      than he needs for himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desired that your life should be free,&rdquo; said Mordecai,
      dreamily&mdash;&ldquo;mine has been a bondage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was clear that he had no interest in the fact of Deronda&rsquo;s
      appearance at the Cohens&rsquo; beyond its relation to his own ideal
      purpose. Despairing of leading easily up to the question he wished to ask,
      Deronda determined to put it abruptly, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me why Mrs. Cohen, the mother, must not be spoken to
      about her daughter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no immediate answer, and he thought that he should have to
      repeat the question. The fact was that Mordecai had heard the words, but
      had to drag his mind to a new subject away from his passionate
      preoccupation. After a few moments, he replied with a careful effort such
      as he would have used if he had been asked the road to Holborn:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the reason. But I will not speak even of trivial family
      affairs which I have heard in the privacy of the family. I dwell in their
      tent as in a sanctuary. Their history, so far as they injure none other,
      is their own possession.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda felt the blood mounting to his cheeks as a sort of rebuke he was
      little used to, and he also found himself painfully baffled where he had
      reckoned with some confidence on getting decisive knowledge. He became the
      more conscious of emotional strain from the excitements of the day; and
      although he had the money in his pocket to redeem his ring, he recoiled
      from the further task of a visit to the Cohens&rsquo;, which must be made
      not only under the former uncertainty, but under a new disappointment as
      to the possibility of its removal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will part from you now,&rdquo; he said, just before they could
      reach Cohen&rsquo;s door; and Mordecai paused, looking up at him with an
      anxious fatigued face under the gaslight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will you come back?&rdquo; he said, with slow emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I leave that unfixed? May I ask for you at the Cohens&rsquo;
      any evening after your hour at the book-shop? There is no objection, I
      suppose, to their knowing that you and I meet in private?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None,&rdquo; said Mordecai. &ldquo;But the days I wait now are
      longer than the years of my strength. Life shrinks: what was but a tithe
      is now the half. My hope abides in you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be faithful,&rdquo; said Deronda&mdash;he could not have
      left those words unuttered. &ldquo;I will come the first evening I can
      after seven: on Saturday or Monday, if possible. Trust me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He put out his ungloved hand. Mordecai, clasping it eagerly, seemed to
      feel a new instreaming of confidence, and he said with some recovered
      energy&mdash;&ldquo;This is come to pass, and the rest will come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was their good-by.

    &ldquo;This, too is probable, according to that saying of Agathon: &lsquo;It is a
    part of probability that many improbable things will happen.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     &mdash;ARISTOTLE: <i>Poetics</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Imagine the conflict in a mind like Deronda&rsquo;s given not only to feel
      strongly but to question actively, on the evening after the interview with
      Mordecai. To a young man of much duller susceptibilities the adventure
      might have seemed enough out of the common way to divide his thoughts; but
      it had stirred Deronda so deeply, that with the usual reaction of his
      intellect he began to examine the grounds of his emotion, and consider how
      far he must resist its guidance. The consciousness that he was half
      dominated by Mordecai&rsquo;s energetic certitude, and still more by his
      fervent trust, roused his alarm. It was his characteristic bias to shrink
      from the moral stupidity of valuing lightly what had come close to him,
      and of missing blindly in his own life of to-day the crisis which he
      recognized as momentous and sacred in the historic life of men. If he had
      read of this incident as having happened centuries ago in Rome, Greece,
      Asia Minor, Palestine, Cairo, to some man young as himself, dissatisfied
      with his neutral life, and wanting some closer fellowship, some more
      special duty to give him ardor for the possible consequences of his work,
      it would have appeared to him quite natural that the incident should have
      created a deep impression on that far-off man, whose clothing and action
      would have been seen in his imagination as part of an age chiefly known to
      us through its more serious effects. Why should he be ashamed of his own
      agitated feeling merely because he dressed for dinner, wore a white tie,
      and lived among people who might laugh at his owning any conscience in the
      matter, as the solemn folly of taking himself too seriously?&mdash;that
      bugbear of circles in which the lack of grave emotion passes for wit. From
      such cowardice before modish ignorance and obtuseness, Deronda shrank. But
      he also shrank from having his course determined by mere contagion,
      without consent of reason; or from allowing a reverential pity for
      spiritual struggle to hurry him along a dimly-seen path.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, after all, had really happened? He knew quite accurately the answer
      Sir Hugo would have given: &ldquo;A consumptive Jew, possessed by a
      fanaticism which obstacles and hastening death intensified, had fixed on
      Deronda as the antitype of some visionary image, the offspring of wedded
      hope and despair: despair of his own life, irrepressible hope in the
      propagation of his fanatical beliefs. The instance was perhaps odd,
      exceptional in its form, but substantially it was not rare. Fanaticism was
      not so common as bankruptcy, but taken in all its aspects it was abundant
      enough. While Mordecai was waiting on the bridge for the fulfillment of
      his visions, another man was convinced that he had the mathematical key of
      the universe which would supersede Newton, and regarded all known
      physicists as conspiring to stifle his discovery and keep the universe
      locked; another, that he had the metaphysical key, with just that hair&rsquo;s-breadth
      of difference from the old wards which would make it fit exactly.
      Scattered here and there in every direction you might find a terrible
      person, with more or less power of speech, and with an eye either
      glittering or preternaturally dull, on the look-out for the man who must
      hear him; and in most cases he had volumes which it was difficult to get
      printed, or if printed to get read. This Mordecai happened to have a more
      pathetic aspect, a more passionate, penetrative speech than was usual with
      such monomaniacs; he was more poetical than a social reformer with colored
      views of the new moral world in parallelograms, or than an enthusiast in
      sewage; still he came under the same class. It would be only right and
      kind to indulge him a little, to comfort him with such help as was
      practicable; but what likelihood was there that his notions had the sort
      of value he ascribed to them? In such cases a man of the world knows what
      to think beforehand. And as to Mordecai&rsquo;s conviction that he had
      found a new executive self, it might be preparing for him the worst of
      disappointments&mdash;that which presents itself as final.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda&rsquo;s ear caught all these negative whisperings; nay, he
      repeated them distinctly to himself. It was not the first but it was the
      most pressing occasion on which he had had to face this question of the
      family likeness among the heirs of enthusiasm, whether prophets or
      dreamers of dreams, whether the
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Great benefactors of mankind, deliverers,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      or the devotees of phantasmal discovery&mdash;from the first believer in
      his own unmanifested inspiration, down to the last inventor of an ideal
      machine that will achieve perpetual motion. The kinship of human passion,
      the sameness of mortal scenery, inevitably fill fact with burlesque and
      parody. Error and folly have had their hecatombs of martyrs. Reduce the
      grandest type of man hitherto known to an abstract statement of his
      qualities and efforts, and he appears in dangerous company: say that, like
      Copernicus and Galileo, he was immovably convinced in the face of hissing
      incredulity; but so is the contriver of perpetual motion. We cannot fairly
      try the spirits by this sort of test. If we want to avoid giving the dose
      of hemlock or the sentence of banishment in the wrong case, nothing will
      do but a capacity to understand the subject-matter on which the immovable
      man is convinced, and fellowship with human travail, both near and afar,
      to hinder us from scanning any deep experience lightly. Shall we say,
      &ldquo;Let the ages try the spirits, and see what they are worth?&rdquo;
      Why, we are the beginning of the ages, which can only be just by virtue of
      just judgments in separate human breasts&mdash;separate yet combined. Even
      steam-engines could not have got made without that condition, but must
      have stayed in the mind of James Watt.
    </p>
    <p>
      This track of thinking was familiar enough to Deronda to have saved him
      from any contemptuous prejudgment of Mordecai, even if their communication
      had been free from that peculiar claim on himself strangely ushered in by
      some long-growing preparation in the Jew&rsquo;s agitated mind. This
      claim, indeed, considered in what is called a rational way, might seem
      justifiably dismissed as illusory and even preposterous; but it was
      precisely what turned Mordecai&rsquo;s hold on him from an appeal to his
      ready sympathy into a clutch on his struggling conscience. Our consciences
      are not all of the same pattern, an inner deliverance of fixed laws: they
      are the voice of sensibilities as various as our memories (which also have
      their kinship and likeness). And Deronda&rsquo;s conscience included
      sensibilities beyond the common, enlarged by his early habit of thinking
      himself imaginatively into the experience of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the claim this eager soul made upon him?&mdash;&ldquo;You must
      believe my beliefs&mdash;be moved by my reasons&mdash;hope my hopes&mdash;see
      the vision I point to&mdash;behold a glory where I behold it!&rdquo; To
      take such a demand in the light of an obligation in any direct sense would
      have been preposterous&mdash;to have seemed to admit it would have been
      dishonesty; and Deronda, looking on the agitation of those moments, felt
      thankful that in the midst of his compassion he had preserved himself from
      the bondage of false concessions. The claim hung, too, on a supposition
      which might be&mdash;nay, probably was&mdash;in discordance with the full
      fact: the supposition that he, Deronda, was of Jewish blood. Was there
      ever a more hypothetic appeal?
    </p>
    <p>
      But since the age of thirteen Deronda had associated the deepest
      experience of his affections with what was a pure supposition, namely,
      that Sir Hugo was his father: that was a hypothesis which had been the
      source of passionate struggle within him; by its light he had been
      accustomed to subdue feelings and to cherish them. He had been well used
      to find a motive in a conception which might be disproved; and he had been
      also used to think of some revelation that might influence his view of the
      particular duties belonging to him. To be in a state of suspense, which
      was also one of emotive activity and scruple, was a familiar attitude of
      his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, suppose that wish-begotten belief in his Jewish birth, and that
      extravagant demand of discipleship, to be the foreshadowing of an actual
      discovery and a genuine spiritual result: suppose that Mordecai&rsquo;s
      ideas made a real conquest over Deronda&rsquo;s conviction? Nay, it was
      conceivable that as Mordecai needed and believed that, he had found an
      active replenishment of himself, so Deronda might receive from Mordecai&rsquo;s
      mind the complete ideal shape of that personal duty and citizenship which
      lay in his own thought like sculptured fragments certifying some beauty
      yearned after but not traceable by divination.
    </p>
    <p>
      As that possibility presented itself in his meditations, he was aware that
      it would be called dreamy, and began to defend it. If the influence he
      imagined himself submitting to had been that of some honored professor,
      some authority in a seat of learning, some philosopher who had been
      accepted as a voice of the age, would a thorough receptiveness toward
      direction have been ridiculed? Only by those who hold it a sign of
      weakness to be obliged for an idea, and prefer to hint that they have
      implicitly held in a more correct form whatever others have stated with a
      sadly short-coming explicitness. After all, what was there but vulgarity
      in taking the fact that Mordecai was a poor Jewish workman, and that he
      was to be met perhaps on a sanded floor in the parlor of the <i>Hand and
      Banner</i> as a reason for determining beforehand that there was not some
      spiritual force within him that might have a determining effect on a
      white-handed gentleman? There is a legend told of the Emperor Domitian,
      that having heard of a Jewish family, of the house of David, whence the
      ruler of the world was to spring, he sent for its members in alarm, but
      quickly released them on observing that they had the hands of work-people&mdash;being
      of just the opposite opinion with that Rabbi who stood waiting at the gate
      of Rome in confidence that the Messiah would be found among the destitute
      who entered there. Both Emperor and Rabbi were wrong in their trust of
      outward signs: poverty and poor clothes are no sign of inspiration, said
      Deronda to his inward objector, but they have gone with it in some
      remarkable cases. And to regard discipleship as out of the question
      because of them, would be mere dullness of imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more plausible reason for putting discipleship out of the question was
      the strain of visionary excitement in Mordecai, which turned his wishes
      into overmastering impressions, and made him read outward facts as
      fulfillment. Was such a temper of mind likely to accompany that wise
      estimate of consequences which is the only safeguard from fatal error,
      even to ennobling motive? But it remained to be seen whether that rare
      conjunction existed or not in Mordecai: perhaps his might be one of the
      natures where a wise estimate of consequences is fused in the fires of
      that passionate belief which determines the consequences it believes in.
      The inspirations of the world have come in that way too: even
      strictly-measuring science could hardly have got on without that
      forecasting ardor which feels the agitations of discovery beforehand, and
      has a faith in its preconception that surmounts many failures of
      experiment. And in relation to human motives and actions, passionate
      belief has a fuller efficacy. Here enthusiasm may have the validity of
      proof, and happening in one soul, give the type of what will one day be
      general.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least, Deronda argued, Mordecai&rsquo;s visionary excitability was
      hardly a reason for concluding beforehand that he was not worth listening
      to except for pity&rsquo;s sake. Suppose he had introduced himself as one
      of the strictest reasoners. Do they form a body of men hitherto free from
      false conclusions and illusory speculations? The driest argument has its
      hallucinations, too hastily concluding that its net will now at last be
      large enough to hold the universe. Men may dream in demonstrations, and
      cut out an illusory world in the shape of axioms, definitions, and
      propositions, with a final exclusion of fact signed Q.E.D. No formulas for
      thinking will save us mortals from mistake in our imperfect apprehension
      of the matter to be thought about. And since the unemotional intellect may
      carry us into a mathematical dreamland where nothing is but what is not,
      perhaps an emotional intellect may have absorbed into its passionate
      vision of possibilities some truth of what will be&mdash;the more
      comprehensive massive life feeding theory with new material, as the
      sensibility of the artist seizes combinations which science explains and
      justifies. At any rate, presumptions to the contrary are not to be
      trusted. We must be patient with the inevitable makeshift of our human
      thinking, whether in its sum total or in the separate minds that have made
      the sum. Columbus had some impressions about himself which we call
      superstitions, and used some arguments which we disapprove; but he had
      also some sound physical conceptions, and he had the passionate patience
      of genius to make them tell on mankind. The world has made up its mind
      rather contemptuously about those who were deaf to Columbus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My contempt for them binds me to see that I don&rsquo;t adopt their
      mistake on a small scale,&rdquo; said Deronda, &ldquo;and make myself deaf
      with the assumption that there cannot be any momentous relation between
      this Jew and me, simply because he has clad it in illusory notions. What I
      can be to him, or he to me, may not at all depend on his persuasion about
      the way we came together. To me the way seems made up of plainly
      discernible links. If I had not found Mirah, it is probable that I should
      not have begun to be specially interested in the Jews, and certainly I
      should not have gone on that loitering search after an Ezra Cohen which
      made me pause at Ram&rsquo;s book-shop and ask the price of <i>Maimon</i>.
      Mordecai, on his side, had his visions of a disciple, and he saw me by
      their light; I corresponded well enough with the image his longing had
      created. He took me for one of his race. Suppose that his impression&mdash;the
      elderly Jew at Frankfort seemed to have something like it&mdash;suppose in
      spite of all presumptions to the contrary, that his impression should
      somehow be proved true, and that I should come actually to share any of
      the ideas he is devoted to? This is the only question which really
      concerns the effect of our meeting on my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if the issue should be quite different?&mdash;well, there will
      be something painful to go through. I shall almost inevitably have to be
      an active cause of that poor fellow&rsquo;s crushing disappointment.
      Perhaps this issue is the one I had need prepare myself for. I fear that
      no tenderness of mine can make his suffering lighter. Would the
      alternative&mdash;that I should not disappoint him&mdash;be less painful
      to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Deronda wavered. Feelings had lately been at work within him which
      had very much modified the reluctance he would formerly have had to think
      of himself as probably a Jew. And, if you like, he was romantic. That
      young energy and spirit of adventure which have helped to create the
      world-wide legions of youthful heroes going to seek the hidden tokens of
      their birth and its inheritance of tasks, gave him a certain quivering
      interest in the bare possibility that he was entering on a like track
      &mdash;all the more because the track was one of thought as well as
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bare possibility.&rdquo; He could not admit it to be more. The
      belief that his father was an Englishman only grew firmer under the weak
      assaults of unwarranted doubt. And that a moment should ever come in which
      that belief was declared a delusion, was something of which Deronda would
      not say, &ldquo;I should be glad.&rdquo; His life-long affection for Sir
      Hugo, stronger than all his resentment, made him shrink from admitting
      that wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which way soever the truth might lie, he repeated to himself what he had
      said to Mordecai&mdash;that he could not without farther reasons undertake
      to hasten its discovery. Nay, he was tempted now to regard his uncertainty
      as a condition to be cherished for the present. If further intercourse
      revealed nothing but illusions as what he was expected to share in, the
      want of any valid evidence that he was a Jew might save Mordecai the worst
      shock in the refusal of fraternity. It might even be justifiable to use
      the uncertainty on this point in keeping up a suspense which would induce
      Mordecai to accept those offices of friendship that Deronda longed to urge
      on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the meditations that busied Deronda in the interval of four
      days before he could fulfill his promise to call for Mordecai at Ezra
      Cohen&rsquo;s, Sir Hugo&rsquo;s demands on him often lasting to an hour so
      late as to put the evening expedition to Holborn out of the question.

    <p>
      &ldquo;If there are ranks in suffering, Israel takes precedence of all the
      nations&mdash;if the duration of sorrows and the patience with which they
      are borne ennoble, the Jews are among the aristocracy of every land&mdash;if
      a literature is called rich in the possession of a few classic tragedies,
      what shall we say to a National Tragedy lasting for fifteen hundred years,
      in which the poets and the actors were also the heroes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda had lately been reading that passage of Zunz, and it occurred to
      him by way of contrast when he was going to the Cohens, who certainly bore
      no obvious stamp of distinction in sorrow or in any other form of
      aristocracy. Ezra Cohen was not clad in the sublime pathos of the martyr,
      and his taste for money-getting seemed to be favored with that success
      which has been the most exasperating difference in the greed of Jews
      during all the ages of their dispersion. This Jeshurun of a pawnbroker was
      not a symbol of the great Jewish tragedy; and yet was there not something
      typical in the fact that a life like Mordecai&rsquo;s&mdash;a frail
      incorporation of the national consciousness, breathing with difficult
      breath&mdash;was nested in the self-gratulating ignorant prosperity of the
      Cohens?
    </p>
    <p>
      Glistening was the gladness in their faces when Deronda reappeared among
      them. Cohen himself took occasion to intimate that although the diamond
      ring, let alone a little longer, would have bred more money, he did not
      mind <i>that</i>&mdash;not a sixpence&mdash;when compared with the
      pleasure of the women and children in seeing a young gentleman whose first
      visit had been so agreeable that they had &ldquo;done nothing but talk of
      it ever since.&rdquo; Young Mrs. Cohen was very sorry that baby was
      asleep, and then very glad that Adelaide was not yet gone to bed,
      entreating Deronda not to stay in the shop, but to go forthwith into the
      parlor to see &ldquo;mother and the children.&rdquo; He willingly accepted
      the invitation, having provided himself with portable presents; a set of
      paper figures for Adelaide, and an ivory cup and ball for Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grandmother had a pack of cards before her and was making &ldquo;plates&rdquo;
      with the children. A plate had just been thrown down and kept itself
      whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Jacob, running to Deronda as he entered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      tread on my plate. Stop and see me throw it up again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda complied, exchanging a smile of understanding with the
      grandmother, and the plate bore several tossings before it came to pieces;
      then the visitor was allowed to come forward and seat himself. He observed
      that the door from which Mordecai had issued on the former visit was now
      closed, but he wished to show his interest in the Cohens before disclosing
      a yet stronger interest in their singular inmate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until he had Adelaide on his knee, and was setting up the paper
      figures in their dance on the table, while Jacob was already practicing
      with the cup and ball, that Deronda said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mordecai in just now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he, Addy?&rdquo; said Cohen, who had seized an interval of
      business to come and look on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the workroom there,&rdquo; said his wife, nodding toward the
      closed door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, sir,&rdquo; said Cohen, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know
      what&rsquo;s come to him this last day or two. He&rsquo;s always what I
      may call a little touched, you know&rdquo;&mdash;here Cohen pointed to his
      own forehead&mdash;&ldquo;not quite so rational in all things, like you
      and me; but he&rsquo;s mostly wonderful regular and industrious so far as
      a poor creature can be, and takes as much delight in the boy as anybody
      could. But this last day or two he&rsquo;s been moving about like a
      sleep-walker, or else sitting as still as a wax figure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the disease, poor dear creature,&rdquo; said the
      grandmother, tenderly. &ldquo;I doubt whether he can stand long against
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I think its only something he&rsquo;s got in his head,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Cohen the younger. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been turning over writing
      continually, and when I speak to him it takes him ever so long to hear and
      answer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may think us a little weak ourselves,&rdquo; said Cohen,
      apologetically. &ldquo;But my wife and mother wouldn&rsquo;t part with him
      if he was a still worse encumbrance. It isn&rsquo;t that we don&rsquo;t
      know the long and short of matters, but it&rsquo;s our principle. There&rsquo;s
      fools do business at a loss and don&rsquo;t know it. I&rsquo;m not one of
      &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mordecai carries a blessing inside him,&rdquo; said the
      grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got something the matter inside him,&rdquo; said Jacob,
      coming up to correct this erratum of his grandmother&rsquo;s. &ldquo;He
      said he couldn&rsquo;t talk to me, and he wouldn&rsquo;t have a bit o&rsquo;
      bun.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far from wondering at your feeling for him,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      &ldquo;I already feel something of the same sort myself. I have lately
      talked to him at Ram&rsquo;s book-shop&mdash;in fact, I promised to call
      for him here, that we might go out together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, then!&rdquo; said Cohen, slapping his knee.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been expecting you, and it&rsquo;s taken hold of him. I
      suppose he talks about his learning to you. It&rsquo;s uncommonly kind of
      <i>you</i>, sir; for I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s much to be got
      out of it, else it wouldn&rsquo;t have left him where he is. But there&rsquo;s
      the shop.&rdquo; Cohen hurried out, and Jacob, who had been listening
      inconveniently near to Deronda&rsquo;s elbow, said to him with obliging
      familiarity, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call Mordecai for you, if you like.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Jacob,&rdquo; said his mother; &ldquo;open the door for the
      gentleman, and let him go in himself Hush! Don&rsquo;t make a noise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Skillful Jacob seemed to enter into the play, and turned the handle of the
      door as noiselessly as possible, while Deronda went behind him and stood
      on the threshold. The small room was lit only by a dying fire and one
      candle with a shade over it. On the board fixed under the window, various
      objects of jewelry were scattered: some books were heaped in the corner
      beyond them. Mordecai was seated on a high chair at the board with his
      back to the door, his hands resting on each other and on the board, a
      watch propped on a stand before him. He was in a state of expectation as
      sickening as that of a prisoner listening for the delayed deliverance&mdash;when
      he heard Deronda&rsquo;s voice saying, &ldquo;I am come for you. Are you
      ready?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately he turned without speaking, seized his furred cap which lay
      near, and moved to join Deronda. It was but a moment before they were both
      in the sitting-room, and Jacob, noticing the change in his friend&rsquo;s
      air and expression, seized him by the arm and said, &ldquo;See my cup and
      ball!&rdquo; sending the ball up close to Mordecai&rsquo;s face, as
      something likely to cheer a convalescent. It was a sign of the relieved
      tension in Mordecai&rsquo;s mind that he could smile and say, &ldquo;Fine,
      fine!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forgotten your greatcoat and comforter,&rdquo; said young
      Mrs. Cohen, and he went back into the work-room and got them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s come to life again, do you see?&rdquo; said Cohen, who
      had re-entered&mdash;speaking in an undertone. &ldquo;I told you so: I&rsquo;m
      mostly right.&rdquo; Then in his usual voice, &ldquo;Well, sir, we mustn&rsquo;t
      detain you now, I suppose; but I hope this isn&rsquo;t the last time we
      shall see you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you come again?&rdquo; said Jacob, advancing. &ldquo;See, I
      can catch the ball; I&rsquo;ll bet I catch it without stopping, if you
      come again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has clever hands,&rdquo; said Deronda, looking at the
      grandmother. &ldquo;Which side of the family does he get them from?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the grandmother only nodded towards her son, who said promptly,
      &ldquo;My side. My wife&rsquo;s family are not in that line. But bless
      your soul! ours is a sort of cleverness as good as gutta percha; you can
      twist it which way you like. There&rsquo;s nothing some old gentlemen won&rsquo;t
      do if you set &lsquo;em to it.&rdquo; Here Cohen winked down at Jacob&rsquo;s
      back, but it was doubtful whether this judicious allusiveness answered its
      purpose, for its subject gave a nasal whinnying laugh and stamped about
      singing, &ldquo;Old gentlemen, old gentlemen,&rdquo; in chiming cadence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda thought, &ldquo;I shall never know anything decisive about these
      people until I ask Cohen pointblank whether he lost a sister named Mirah
      when she was six years old.&rdquo; The decisive moment did not yet seem
      easy for him to face. Still his first sense of repulsion at the commonness
      of these people was beginning to be tempered with kindlier feeling.
      However unrefined their airs and speech might be, he was forced to admit
      some moral refinement in their treatment of the consumptive workman, whose
      mental distinction impressed them chiefly as a harmless, silent raving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Cohens seem to have an affection for you,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      as soon as he and Mordecai were off the doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I for them,&rdquo; was the immediate answer. &ldquo;They have
      the heart of the Israelite within them, though they are as the horse and
      the mule, without understanding beyond the narrow path they tread.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have caused you some uneasiness, I fear,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      &ldquo;by my slowness in fulfilling my promise. I wished to come
      yesterday, but I found it impossible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I trusted you. But it is true I have been uneasy,
      for the spirit of my youth has been stirred within me, and this body is
      not strong enough to bear the beating of its wings. I am as a man bound
      and imprisoned through long years: behold him brought to speech of his
      fellow and his limbs set free: he weeps, he totters, the joy within him
      threatens to break and overthrow the tabernacle of flesh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not speak too much in this evening air,&rdquo; said
      Deronda, feeling Mordecai&rsquo;s words of reliance like so many cords
      binding him painfully. &ldquo;Cover your mouth with the woolen scarf. We
      are going to the <i>Hand and Banner</i>, I suppose, and shall be in
      private there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that is my trouble that you did not come yesterday. For this is
      the evening of the club I spoke of, and we might not have any minutes
      alone until late, when all the rest are gone. Perhaps we had better seek
      another place. But I am used to that only. In new places the outer world
      presses on me and narrows the inward vision. And the people there are
      familiar with my face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the club if I am allowed to go in,&rdquo; said
      Deronda. &ldquo;It is enough that you like this place best. If we have not
      enough time I will come again. What sort of club is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is called &lsquo;The Philosophers.&rsquo; They are few&mdash;like
      the cedars of Lebanon&mdash;poor men given to thought. But none so poor as
      I am: and sometimes visitors of higher worldly rank have been brought. We
      are allowed to introduce a friend, who is interested in our topics. Each
      orders beer or some other kind of drink, in payment for the room. Most of
      them smoke. I have gone when I could, for there are other men of my race
      who come, and sometimes I have broken silence. I have pleased myself with
      a faint likeness between these poor philosophers and the Masters who
      handed down the thought of our race&mdash;the great Transmitters, who
      labored with their hands for scant bread, but preserved and enlarged for
      us the heritage of memory, and saved the soul of Israel alive as a seed
      among the tombs. The heart pleases itself with faint resemblances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very glad to go and sit among them, if that will suit
      you. It is a sort of meeting I should like to join in,&rdquo; said
      Deronda, not without relief in the prospect of an interval before he went
      through the strain of his next private conversation with Mordecai.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three minutes they had opened the glazed door with the red curtain, and
      were in the little parlor, hardly much more than fifteen feet square,
      where the gaslight shone through a slight haze of smoke on what to Deronda
      was a new and striking scene. Half-a-dozen men of various ages, from
      between twenty and thirty to fifty, all shabbily dressed, most of them
      with clay pipes in their mouths, were listening with a look of
      concentrated intelligence to a man in a pepper-and-salt dress, with blonde
      hair, short nose, broad forehead and general breadth, who, holding his
      pipe slightly uplifted in the left hand, and beating his knee with the
      right, was just finishing a quotation from Shelley (the comparison of the
      avalanche in his &ldquo;Prometheus Unbound&rdquo;)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;As thought by thought is piled, till some great truth
  Is loosened, and the nations echo round.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The entrance of the new-comers broke the fixity of attention, and called
      for re-arrangement of seats in the too narrow semicircle round the
      fire-place and the table holding the glasses, spare pipes and tobacco.
      This was the soberest of clubs; but sobriety is no reason why smoking and
      &ldquo;taking something&rdquo; should be less imperiously needed as a
      means of getting a decent status in company and debate. Mordecai was
      received with welcoming voices which had a slight cadence of compassion in
      them, but naturally all glances passed immediately to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought a friend who is interested in our subjects,&rdquo;
      said Mordecai. &ldquo;He has traveled and studied much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the gentlemen anonymous? Is he a Great Unknown?&rdquo; said the
      broad-chested quoter of Shelley, with a humorous air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Daniel Deronda. I am unknown, but not in any sense
      great.&rdquo; The smile breaking over the stranger&rsquo;s grave face as
      he said this was so agreeable that there was a general indistinct murmur,
      equivalent to a &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; and the broad man said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You recommend the name, sir, and are welcome. Here, Mordecai, come
      to this corner against me,&rdquo; he added, evidently wishing to give the
      coziest place to the one who most needed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda was well satisfied to get a seat on the opposite side, where his
      general survey of the party easily included Mordecai, who remained an
      eminently striking object in this group of sharply-characterized figures,
      more than one of whom, even to Daniel&rsquo;s little exercised
      discrimination, seemed probably of Jewish descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact pure English blood (if leech or lancet can furnish us with the
      precise product) did not declare itself predominantly in the party at
      present assembled. Miller, the broad man, an exceptional second-hand
      bookseller who knew the insides of books, had at least grand-parents who
      called themselves German, and possibly far-away ancestors who denied
      themselves to be Jews; Buchan, the saddler, was Scotch; Pash, the
      watchmaker, was a small, dark, vivacious, triple-baked Jew; Gideon, the
      optical instrument maker, was a Jew of the red-haired, generous-featured
      type easily passing for Englishmen of unusually cordial manners: and
      Croop, the dark-eyed shoemaker, was probably more Celtic than he knew.
      Only three would have been discernable everywhere as Englishmen: the
      wood-inlayer Goodwin, well-built, open-faced, pleasant-voiced; the florid
      laboratory assistant Marrables; and Lily, the pale, neat-faced
      copying-clerk, whose light-brown hair was set up in a small parallelogram
      above his well-filled forehead, and whose shirt, taken with an otherwise
      seedy costume, had a freshness that might be called insular, and perhaps
      even something narrower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly a company select of the select among poor men, being drawn
      together by a taste not prevalent even among the privileged heirs of
      learning and its institutions; and not likely to amuse any gentleman in
      search of crime or low comedy as the ground of interest in people whose
      weekly income is only divisible into shillings. Deronda, even if he had
      not been more than usually inclined to gravity under the influence of what
      was pending between him and Mordecai, would not have set himself to find
      food for laughter in the various shades of departure from the tone of
      polished society sure to be observable in the air and talk of these men
      who had probably snatched knowledge as most of us snatch indulgences,
      making the utmost of scant opportunity. He looked around him with the
      quiet air of respect habitual to him among equals, ordered whisky and
      water, and offered the contents of his cigar-case, which,
      characteristically enough, he always carried and hardly ever used for his
      own behoof, having reasons for not smoking himself, but liking to indulge
      others. Perhaps it was his weakness to be afraid of seeming
      straight-laced, and turning himself into a sort of diagram instead of a
      growth which can exercise the guiding attraction of fellowship. That he
      made a decidedly winning impression on the company was proved by their
      showing themselves no less at ease than before, and desirous of quickly
      resuming their interrupted talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what I call one of our touch-and-go nights, sir,&rdquo;
      said Miller, who was implicitly accepted as a sort of moderator&mdash;on
      addressing Deronda by way of explanation, and nodding toward each person
      whose name he mentioned. &ldquo;Sometimes we stick pretty close to the
      point. But tonight our friend Pash, there, brought up the law of progress;
      and we got on statistics; then Lily, there, saying we knew well enough
      before counting that in the same state of society the same sort of things
      would happen, and it was no more wonder that quantities should remain the
      same, than that qualities should remain the same, for in relation to
      society numbers are qualities&mdash;the number of drunkards is a quality
      in society&mdash;the numbers are an index to the qualities, and give us no
      instruction, only setting us to consider the causes of difference between
      different social states&mdash;Lily saying this, we went off on the causes
      of social change, and when you came in I was going upon the power of
      ideas, which I hold to be the main transforming cause.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hold with you there, Miller,&rdquo; said Goodwin, the
      inlayer, more concerned to carry on the subject than to wait for a word
      from the new guest. &ldquo;For either you mean so many sorts of things by
      ideas that I get no knowledge by what you say, any more than if you said
      light was a cause; or else you mean a particular sort of ideas, and then I
      go against your meaning as too narrow. For, look at it in one way, all
      actions men put a bit of thought into are ideas&mdash;say, sowing seed, or
      making a canoe, or baking clay; and such ideas as these work themselves
      into life and go on growing with it, but they can&rsquo;t go apart from
      the material that set them to work and makes a medium for them. It&rsquo;s
      the nature of wood and stone yielding to the knife that raises the idea of
      shaping them, and with plenty of wood and stone the shaping will go on. I
      look at it, that such ideas as are mixed straight away with all the other
      elements of life are powerful along with &lsquo;em. The slower the mixing,
      the less power they have. And as to the causes of social change, I look at
      it in this way&mdash;ideas are a sort of parliament, but there&rsquo;s a
      commonwealth outside and a good deal of the commonwealth is working at
      change without knowing what the parliament is doing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you take ready mixing as your test of power,&rdquo; said
      Pash, &ldquo;some of the least practical ideas beat everything. They
      spread without being understood, and enter into the language without being
      thought of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may act by changing the distribution of gases,&rdquo; said
      Marrables; &ldquo;instruments are getting so fine now, men may come to
      register the spread of a theory by observed changes in the atmosphere and
      corresponding changes in the nerves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pash, his dark face lighting up rather impishly,
      &ldquo;there is the idea of nationalities; I dare say the wild asses are
      snuffing it, and getting more gregarious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t share that idea?&rdquo; said Deronda, finding a
      piquant incongruity between Pash&rsquo;s sarcasm and the strong stamp of
      race on his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, rather, he does not share that spirit,&rdquo; said Mordecai,
      who had turned a melancholy glance on Pash. &ldquo;Unless nationality is a
      feeling, what force can it have as an idea?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granted, Mordecai,&rdquo; said Pash, quite good-humoredly. &ldquo;And
      as the feeling of nationality is dying, I take the idea to be no better
      than a ghost, already walking to announce the death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sentiment may seem to be dying and yet revive into strong life,&rdquo;
      said Deronda. &ldquo;Nations have revived. We may live to see a great
      outburst of force in the Arabs, who are being inspired with a new zeal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen, amen,&rdquo; said Mordecai, looking at Deronda with a delight
      which was the beginning of recovered energy: his attitude was more
      upright, his face was less worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may hold with backward nations,&rdquo; said Pash, &ldquo;but
      with us in Europe the sentiment of nationality is destined to die out. It
      will last a little longer in the quarters where oppression lasts, but
      nowhere else. The whole current of progress is setting against it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Buchan, in a rapid thin Scotch tone which was like
      the letting in of a little cool air on the conversation, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ve
      done well to bring us round to the point. Ye&rsquo;re all agreed that
      societies change&mdash;not always and everywhere&mdash;but on the whole
      and in the long run. Now, with all deference, I would beg t&rsquo; observe
      that we have got to examine the nature of changes before we have a warrant
      to call them progress, which word is supposed to include a bettering,
      though I apprehend it to be ill-chosen for that purpose, since mere motion
      onward may carry us to a bog or a precipice. And the questions I would put
      are three: Is all change in the direction of progress? if not, how shall
      we discern which change is progress and which not? and thirdly, how far
      and in what way can we act upon the course of change so as to promote it
      where it is beneficial, and divert it where it is injurious?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Buchan&rsquo;s attempt to impose his method on the talk was a failure.
      Lily immediately said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Change and progress are merged in the idea of development. The laws
      of development are being discovered, and changes taking place according to
      them are necessarily progressive; that is to say, it we have any notion of
      progress or improvement opposed to them, the notion is a mistake.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t see how you arrive at that sort of certitude
      about changes by calling them development,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;There
      will still remain the degrees of inevitableness in relation to our own
      will and acts, and the degrees of wisdom in hastening or retarding; there
      will still remain the danger of mistaking a tendency which should be
      resisted for an inevitable law that we must adjust ourselves to,&mdash;which
      seems to me as bad a superstition or false god as any that has been set up
      without the ceremonies of philosophizing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a truth,&rdquo; said Mordecai. &ldquo;Woe to the men who
      see no place for resistance in this generation! I believe in a growth, a
      passage, and a new unfolding of life whereof the seed is more perfect,
      more charged with the elements that are pregnant with diviner form. The
      life of a people grows, it is knit together and yet expanded, in joy and
      sorrow, in thought and action; it absorbs the thought of other nations
      into its own forms, and gives back the thought as new wealth to the world;
      it is a power and an organ in the great body of the nations. But there may
      come a check, an arrest; memories may be stifled, and love may be faint
      for the lack of them; or memories may shrink into withered relics&mdash;the
      soul of a people, whereby they know themselves to be one, may seem to be
      dying for want of common action. But who shall say, &lsquo;The fountain of
      their life is dried up, they shall forever cease to be a nation?&rsquo;
      Who shall say it? Not he who feels the life of his people stirring within
      his own. Shall he say, &lsquo;That way events are wending, I will not
      resist?&rsquo; His very soul is resistance, and is as a seed of fire that
      may enkindle the souls of multitudes, and make a new pathway for events.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny patriotism,&rdquo; said Gideon, &ldquo;but we
      all know you have a particular meaning, Mordecai. You know Mordecai&rsquo;s
      way of thinking, I suppose.&rdquo; Here Gideon had turned to Deronda, who
      sat next to him, but without waiting for an answer he went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      a rational Jew myself. I stand by my people as a sort of family relations,
      and I am for keeping up our worship in a rational way. I don&rsquo;t
      approve of our people getting baptised, because I don&rsquo;t believe in a
      Jew&rsquo;s conversion to the Gentile part of Christianity. And now we
      have political equality, there&rsquo;s no excuse for a pretense of that
      sort. But I am for getting rid of all of our superstitions and
      exclusiveness. There&rsquo;s no reason now why we shouldn&rsquo;t melt
      gradually into the populations we live among. That&rsquo;s the order of
      the day in point of progress. I would as soon my children married
      Christians as Jews. And I&rsquo;m for the old maxim, &lsquo;A man&rsquo;s
      country is where he&rsquo;s well off.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That country&rsquo;s not so easy to find, Gideon,&rdquo; said the
      rapid Pash, with a shrug and grimace. &ldquo;You get ten shillings a-week
      more than I do, and have only half the number of children. If somebody
      will introduce a brisk trade in watches among the &lsquo;Jerusalem wares,&rsquo;
      I&rsquo;ll go&mdash;eh, Mordecai, what do you say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda, all ear for these hints of Mordecai&rsquo;s opinion, was inwardly
      wondering at his persistence in coming to this club. For an enthusiastic
      spirit to meet continually the fixed indifference of men familiar with the
      object of his enthusiasm is the acceptance of a slow martyrdom, beside
      which the fate of a missionary tomahawked without any considerate
      rejection of his doctrines seems hardly worthy of compassion. But Mordecai
      gave no sign of shrinking: this was a moment of spiritual fullness, and he
      cared more for the utterance of his faith than for its immediate
      reception. With a fervor which had no temper in it, but seemed rather the
      rush of feeling in the opportunity of speech, he answered Pash:,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say is, let every man keep far away from the brotherhood and
      inheritance he despises. Thousands on thousands of our race have mixed
      with the Gentiles as Celt with Saxon, and they may inherit the blessing
      that belongs to the Gentile. You cannot follow them. You are one of the
      multitudes over this globe who must walk among the nations and be known as
      Jews, and with words on their lips which mean, &lsquo;I wish I had not
      been born a Jew, I disown any bond with the long travail of my race, I
      will outdo the Gentile in mocking at our separateness,&rsquo; they all the
      while feel breathing on them the breath of contempt because they are Jews,
      and they will breathe it back poisonously. Can a fresh-made garment of
      citizenship weave itself straightway into the flesh and change the slow
      deposit of eighteen centuries? What is the citizenship of him who walks
      among a people he has no hardy kindred and fellowship with, and has lost
      the sense of brotherhood with his own race? It is a charter of selfish
      ambition and rivalry in low greed. He is an alien of spirit, whatever he
      may be in form; he sucks the blood of mankind, he is not a man, sharing in
      no loves, sharing in no subjection of the soul, he mocks it all. Is it not
      truth I speak, Pash?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly, Mordecai,&rdquo; said Pash, &ldquo;if you mean that I
      think the worse of myself for being a Jew. What I thank our fathers for is
      that there are fewer blockheads among us than among other races. But
      perhaps you are right in thinking the Christians don&rsquo;t like me so
      well for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catholics and Protestants have not liked each other much better,&rdquo;
      said the genial Gideon. &ldquo;We must wait patiently for prejudices to
      die out. Many of our people are on a footing with the best, and there&rsquo;s
      been a good filtering of our blood into high families. I am for making our
      expectations rational.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so am I!&rdquo; said Mordecai, quickly, leaning forward with
      the eagerness of one who pleads in some decisive crisis, his long, thin
      hands clasped together on his lap. &ldquo;I, too, claim to be a rational
      Jew. But what is it to be rational&mdash;what is it to feel the light of
      the divine reason growing stronger within and without? It is to see more
      and more of the hidden bonds that bind and consecrate change as a
      dependent growth&mdash;yea, consecrate it with kinship: the past becomes
      my parent and the future stretches toward me the appealing arms of
      children. Is it rational to drain away the sap of special kindred that
      makes the families of men rich in interchanged wealth, and various as the
      forests are various with the glory of the cedar and the palm? When it is
      rational to say, &lsquo;I know not my father or my mother, let my children
      be aliens to me, that no prayer of mine may touch them,&rsquo; then it
      will be rational for the Jew to say, &lsquo;I will seek to know no
      difference between me and the Gentile, I will not cherish the prophetic
      consciousness of our nationality&mdash;let the Hebrew cease to be, and let
      all his memorials be antiquarian trifles, dead as the wall-paintings of a
      conjectured race. Yet let his child learn by rote the speech of the Greek,
      where he abjures his fellow-citizens by the bravery of those who fought
      foremost at Marathon&mdash;let him learn to say that was noble in the
      Greek, that is the spirit of an immortal nation! But the Jew has no
      memories that bind him to action; let him laugh that his nation is
      degraded from a nation; let him hold the monuments of his law which
      carried within its frame the breath of social justice, of charity, and of
      household sanctities&mdash;let him hold the energy of the prophets, the
      patient care of the Masters, the fortitude of martyred generations, as
      mere stuff for a professorship. The business of the Jew in all things is
      to be even as the rich Gentile.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai threw himself back in his chair, and there was a moment&rsquo;s
      silence. Not one member of the club shared his point of view or his
      emotion; but his whole personality and speech had on them the effect of a
      dramatic representation which had some pathos in it, though no practical
      consequences; and usually he was at once indulged and contradicted.
      Deronda&rsquo;s mind went back upon what must have been the tragic
      pressure of outward conditions hindering this man, whose force he felt to
      be telling on himself, from making any world for his thought in the minds
      of others&mdash;like a poet among people of a strange speech, who may have
      a poetry of their own, but have no ear for his cadence, no answering
      thrill to his discovery of the latent virtues in his mother tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cool Buchan was the first to speak, and hint the loss of time. &ldquo;I
      submit,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that ye&rsquo;re traveling away from the
      questions I put concerning progress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say they&rsquo;re levanting, Buchan,&rdquo; said Miller, who liked
      his joke, and would not have objected to be called Voltairian. &ldquo;Never
      mind. Let us have a Jewish night; we&rsquo;ve not had one for a long
      while. Let us take the discussion on Jewish ground. I suppose we&rsquo;ve
      no prejudice here; we&rsquo;re all philosophers; and we like our friends
      Mordecai, Pash, and Gideon, as well as if they were no more kin to Abraham
      than the rest of us. We&rsquo;re all related through Adam, until further
      showing to the contrary, and if you look into history we&rsquo;ve all got
      some discreditable forefathers. So I mean no offence when I say I don&rsquo;t
      think any great things of the part the Jewish people have played in the
      world. What then? I think they were iniquitously dealt by in past times.
      And I suppose we don&rsquo;t want any men to be maltreated, white, black,
      brown, or yellow&mdash;I know I&rsquo;ve just given my half-crown to the
      contrary. And that reminds me, I&rsquo;ve a curious old German book&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t read it myself, but a friend of mine was reading out of it to
      me the other day&mdash;about the prejudicies against the Jews, and the
      stories used to be told against &lsquo;em, and what do you think one was?
      Why, that they&rsquo;re punished with a bad odor in their bodies; and <i>that</i>,
      says the author, date 1715 (I&rsquo;ve just been pricing and marking the
      book this very morning)&mdash;that is true, for the ancients spoke of it.
      But then, he says, the other things are fables, such as that the odor goes
      away all at once when they&rsquo;re baptized, and that every one of the
      ten tribes, mind you, all the ten being concerned in the crucifixion, has
      got a particular punishment over and above the smell:&mdash;Asher, I
      remember, has the right arm a handbreadth shorter than the left, and
      Naphthali has pig&rsquo;s ears and a smell of live pork. What do you think
      of that? There&rsquo;s been a good deal of fun made of rabbinical fables,
      but in point of fables my opinion is, that all over the world it&rsquo;s
      six of one and half-a-dozen of the other. However, as I said before, I
      hold with the philosophers of the last century that the Jews have played
      no great part as a people, though Pash will have it they&rsquo;re clever
      enough to beat all the rest of the world. But if so, I ask, why haven&rsquo;t
      they done it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the same reason that the cleverest men in the country don&rsquo;t
      get themselves or their ideas into Parliament,&rdquo; said the ready Pash;
      &ldquo;because the blockheads are too many for &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a vain question,&rdquo; said Mordecai, &ldquo;whether our
      people would beat the rest of the world. Each nation has its own work, and
      is a member of the world, enriched by the work of each. But it is true, as
      Jehuda-ha-Levi first said, that Israel is the heart of mankind, if we mean
      by heart the core of affection which binds a race and its families in
      dutiful love, and the reverence for the human body which lifts the needs
      of our animal life into religion, and the tenderness which is merciful to
      the poor and weak and to the dumb creature that wears the yoke for us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not behind any nation in arrogance,&rdquo; said Lily;
      &ldquo;and if they have got in the rear, it has not been because they were
      over-modest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, every nation brags in its turn,&rdquo; said Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pash, &ldquo;and some of them in the Hebrew text.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whatever the Jews contributed at one time, they are a
      stand-still people,&rdquo; said Lily. &ldquo;They are the type of
      obstinate adherence to the superannuated. They may show good abilities
      when they take up liberal ideas, but as a race they have no development in
      them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is false!&rdquo; said Mordecai, leaning forward again with his
      former eagerness. &ldquo;Let their history be known and examined; let the
      seed be sifted, let its beginning be traced to the weed of the wilderness&mdash;the
      more glorious will be the energy that transformed it. Where else is there
      a nation of whom it may be as truly said that their religion and law and
      moral life mingled as the stream of blood in the heart and made one growth&mdash;where
      else a people who kept and enlarged their spiritual store at the very time
      when they are hated with a hatred as fierce as the forest fires that chase
      the wild beast from his covert? There is a fable of the Roman, that
      swimming to save his life he held the roll of his writings between his
      teeth and saved them from the waters. But how much more than that is true
      of our race? They struggled to keep their place among the nations like
      heroes&mdash;yea, when the hand was hacked off, they clung with their
      teeth; but when the plow and the harrow had passed over the last visible
      signs of their national covenant, and the fruitfulness of their land was
      stifled with the blood of the sowers and planters, they said, &lsquo;The
      spirit is alive, let us make it a lasting habitation&mdash;lasting because
      movable&mdash;so that it may be carried from generation to generation, and
      our sons unborn may be rich in the things that have been, and possess a
      hope built on an unchangeable foundation.&rsquo; They said it and they
      wrought it, though often breathing with scant life, as in a coffin, or as
      lying wounded amid a heap of slain. Hooted and scared like the unknown
      dog, the Hebrew made himself envied for his wealth and wisdom, and was
      bled of them to fill the bath of Gentile luxury; he absorbed knowledge, he
      diffused it; his dispersed race was a new Phoenicia working the mines of
      Greece and carrying their products to the world. The native spirit of our
      tradition was not to stand still, but to use records as a seed and draw
      out the compressed virtues of law and prophecy; and while the Gentile, who
      had said, &lsquo;What is yours is ours, and no longer yours,&rsquo; was
      reading the letter of our law as a dark inscription, or was turning its
      parchments into shoe-soles for an army rabid with lust and cruelty, our
      Masters were still enlarging and illuminating with fresh-fed
      interpretation. But the dispersion was wide, the yoke of oppression was a
      spiked torture as well as a load; the exile was forced afar among brutish
      people, where the consciousness of his race was no clearer to him than the
      light of the sun to our fathers in the Roman persecution, who had their
      hiding-place in a cave, and knew not that it was day save by the dimmer
      burning of their candles. What wonder that multitudes of our people are
      ignorant, narrow, superstitious? What wonder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mordecai, whose seat was next the fireplace, rose and leaned his arm
      on the little shelf; his excitement had risen, though his voice, which had
      begun with unusual strength, was getting hoarser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What wonder? The night is unto them, that they have no vision; in
      their darkness they are unable to divine; the sun is gone down over the
      prophets, and the day is dark above them; their observances are as
      nameless relics. But which among the chief of the Gentile nations has not
      an ignorant multitude? They scorn our people&rsquo;s ignorant observance;
      but the most accursed ignorance is that which has no observance&mdash;sunk
      to the cunning greed of the fox, to which all law is no more than a trap
      or the cry of the worrying hound. There is a degradation deep down below
      the memory that has withered into superstition. In the multitudes of the
      ignorant on three continents who observe our rites and make the confession
      of the divine Unity, the soul of Judaism is not dead. Revive the organic
      centre: let the unity of Israel which has made the growth and form of its
      religion be an outward reality. Looking toward a land and a polity, our
      dispersed people in all the ends of the earth may share the dignity of a
      national life which has a voice among the peoples of the East and the West&mdash;which
      will plant the wisdom and skill of our race so that it may be, as of old,
      a medium of transmission and understanding. Let that come to pass, and the
      living warmth will spread to the weak extremities of Israel, and
      superstition will vanish, not in the lawlessness of the renegade, but in
      the illumination of great facts which widen feeling, and make all
      knowledge alive as the young offspring of beloved memories.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai&rsquo;s voice had sunk, but with the hectic brilliancy of his
      gaze it was not the less impressive. His extraordinary excitement was
      certainly due to Deronda&rsquo;s presence: it was to Deronda that he was
      speaking, and the moment had a testamentary solemnity for him which
      rallied all his powers. Yet the presence of those other familiar men
      promoted expression, for they embodied the indifference which gave a
      resistant energy to his speech. Not that he looked at Deronda: he seemed
      to see nothing immediately around him, and if any one had grasped him he
      would probably not have known it. Again the former words came back to
      Deronda&rsquo;s mind,&mdash;&ldquo;You must hope my hopes&mdash;see the
      vision I point to&mdash;behold a glory where I behold it.&rdquo; They came
      now with gathered pathos. Before him stood, as a living, suffering
      reality, what hitherto he had only seen as an effort of imagination,
      which, in its comparative faintness, yet carried a suspicion, of being
      exaggerated: a man steeped in poverty and obscurity, weakened by disease,
      consciously within the shadow of advancing death, but living an intense
      life in an invisible past and future, careless of his personal lot, except
      for its possible making some obstruction to a conceived good which he
      would never share except as a brief inward vision&mdash;a day afar off,
      whose sun would never warm him, but into which he threw his soul&rsquo;s
      desire, with a passion often wanting to the personal motives of healthy
      youth. It was something more than a grandiose transfiguration of the
      parental love that toils, renounces, endures, resists the suicidal
      promptings of despair&mdash;all because of the little ones, whose future
      becomes present to the yearning gaze of anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      All eyes were fixed on Mordecai as he sat down again, and none with
      unkindness; but it happened that the one who felt the most kindly was the
      most prompted to speak in opposition. This was the genial and rational
      Gideon, who also was not without a sense that he was addressing the guest
      of the evening. He said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have your own way of looking at things, Mordecai, and as you
      say, your own way seems to you rational. I know you don&rsquo;t hold with
      the restoration of Judea by miracle, and so on; but you are as well aware
      as I am that the subject has been mixed with a heap of nonsense both by
      Jews and Christians. And as to the connection of our race with Palestine,
      it has been perverted by superstition till it&rsquo;s as demoralizing as
      the old poor-law. The raff and scum go there to be maintained like
      able-bodied paupers, and to be taken special care of by the angel Gabriel
      when they die. It&rsquo;s no use fighting against facts. We must look
      where they point; that&rsquo;s what I call rationality. The most learned
      and liberal men among us who are attached to our religion are for clearing
      our liturgy of all such notions as a literal fulfillment of the prophecies
      about restoration, and so on. Prune it of a few useless rites and literal
      interpretations of that sort, and our religion is the simplest of all
      religions, and makes no barrier, but a union, between us and the rest of
      the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As plain as a pike-staff,&rdquo; said Pash, with an ironical laugh.
      &ldquo;You pluck it up by the roots, strip off the leaves and bark, shave
      off the knots, and smooth it at top and bottom; put it where you will, it
      will do no harm, it will never sprout. You may make a handle of it, or you
      may throw it on the bonfire of scoured rubbish. I don&rsquo;t see why our
      rubbish is to be held sacred any more than the rubbish of Brahmanism or
      Buddhism.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mordecai, &ldquo;no, Pash, because you have lost
      the heart of the Jew. Community was felt before it was called good. I
      praise no superstition, I praise the living fountains of enlarging belief.
      What is growth, completion, development? You began with that question, I
      apply it to the history of our people. I say that the effect of our
      separateness will not be completed and have its highest transformation
      unless our race takes on again the character of a nationality. That is the
      fulfillment of the religious trust that moulded them into a people, whose
      life has made half the inspiration of the world. What is it to me that the
      ten tribes are lost untraceably, or that multitudes of the children of
      Judah have mixed themselves with the Gentile populations as a river with
      rivers? Behold our people still! Their skirts spread afar; they are torn
      and soiled and trodden on; but there is a jeweled breastplate. Let the
      wealthy men, the monarchs of commerce, the learned in all knowledge, the
      skilful in all arts, the speakers, the political counselors, who carry in
      their veins the Hebrew blood which has maintained its vigor in all
      climates, and the pliancy of the Hebrew genius for which difficulty means
      new device&mdash;let them say, &lsquo;we will lift up a standard, we will
      unite in a labor hard but glorious like that of Moses and Ezra, a labor
      which shall be a worthy fruit of the long anguish whereby our fathers
      maintained their separateness, refusing the ease of falsehood.&rsquo; They
      have wealth enough to redeem the soil from debauched and paupered
      conquerors; they have the skill of the statesman to devise, the tongue of
      the orator to persuade. And is there no prophet or poet among us to make
      the ears of Christian Europe tingle with shame at the hideous obloquy of
      Christian strife which the Turk gazes at as at the fighting of beasts to
      which he has lent an arena? There is store of wisdom among us to found a
      new Jewish polity, grand, simple, just, like the old&mdash;a republic
      where there is equality of protection, an equality which shone like a star
      on the forehead of our ancient community, and gave it more than the
      brightness of Western freedom amid the despotisms of the East. Then our
      race shall have an organic centre, a heart and brain to watch and guide
      and execute; the outraged Jew shall have a defense in the court of
      nations, as the outraged Englishmen of America. And the world will gain as
      Israel gains. For there will be a community in the van of the East which
      carries the culture and the sympathies of every great nation in its bosom:
      there will be a land set for a halting-place of enmities, a neutral ground
      for the East as Belgium is for the West. Difficulties? I know there are
      difficulties. But let the spirit of sublime achievement move in the great
      among our people, and the work will begin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, we may safely admit that, Mordecai,&rdquo; said Pash. &ldquo;When
      there are great men on &lsquo;Change, and high-flying professors converted
      to your doctrine, difficulties will vanish like smoke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda, inclined by nature to take the side of those on whom the arrows
      of scorn were falling, could not help replying to Pash&rsquo;s outfling,
      and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we look back to the history of efforts which have made great
      changes, it is astonishing how many of them seemed hopeless to those who
      looked on in the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take what we have all heard and seen something of&mdash;the effort
      after the unity of Italy, which we are sure soon to see accomplished to
      the very last boundary. Look into Mazzini&rsquo;s account of his first
      yearning, when he was a boy, after a restored greatness and a new freedom
      to Italy, and of his first efforts as a young man to rouse the same
      feelings in other young men, and get them to work toward a united
      nationality. Almost everything seemed against him; his countrymen were
      ignorant or indifferent, governments hostile, Europe incredulous. Of
      course the scorners often seemed wise. Yet you see the prophecy lay with
      him. As long as there is a remnant of national consciousness, I suppose
      nobody will deny that there may be a new stirring of memories and hopes
      which may inspire arduous action.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said Mordecai, to whom Deronda&rsquo;s words were a
      cordial. &ldquo;What is needed is the leaven&mdash;what is needed is the
      seed of fire. The heritage of Israel is beating in the pulses of millions;
      it lives in their veins as a power without understanding, like the morning
      exultation of herds; it is the inborn half of memory, moving as in a dream
      among writings on the walls, which it sees dimly but cannot divide into
      speech. Let the torch of visible community be lit! Let the reason of
      Israel disclose itself in a great outward deed, and let there be another
      great migration, another choosing of Israel to be a nationality whose
      members may still stretch to the ends of the earth, even as the sons of
      England and Germany, whom enterprise carries afar, but who still have a
      national hearth and a tribunal of national opinion. Will any say &lsquo;It
      cannot be&rsquo;? Baruch Spinoza had not a faithful Jewish heart, though
      he had sucked the life of his intellect at the breasts of Jewish
      tradition. He laid bare his father&rsquo;s nakedness and said, &lsquo;They
      who scorn him have the higher wisdom.&rsquo; Yet Baruch Spinoza confessed,
      he saw not why Israel should not again be a chosen nation. Who says that
      the history and literature of our race are dead? Are they not as living as
      the history and literature of Greece and Rome, which have inspired
      revolutions, enkindled the thought of Europe, and made the unrighteous
      powers tremble? These were an inheritance dug from the tomb. Ours is an
      inheritance that has never ceased to quiver in millions of human frames.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai had stretched his arms upward, and his long thin hands quivered
      in the air for a moment after he had ceased to speak. Gideon was certainly
      a little moved, for though there was no long pause before he made a remark
      in objection, his tone was more mild and deprecatory than before; Pash,
      meanwhile, pressing his lips together, rubbing his black head with both
      his hands and wrinkling his brow horizontally, with the expression of one
      who differs from every speaker, but does not think it worth while to say
      so. There is a sort of human paste that when it comes near the fire of
      enthusiasm is only baked into harder shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may seem well enough on one side to make so much of our memories
      and inheritance as you do, Mordecai,&rdquo; said Gideon; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s
      another side. It isn&rsquo;t all gratitude and harmless glory. Our people
      have inherited a good deal of hatred. There&rsquo;s a pretty lot of curses
      still flying about, and stiff settled rancor inherited from the times of
      persecution. How will you justify keeping one sort of memory and throwing
      away the other? There are ugly debts standing on both sides.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I justify the choice as all other choice is justified,&rdquo; said
      Mordecai. &ldquo;I cherish nothing for the Jewish nation, I seek nothing
      for them, but the good which promises good to all the nations. The spirit
      of our religious life, which is one with our national life, is not hatred
      of aught but wrong. The Master has said, an offence against man is worse
      than an offence against God. But what wonder if there is hatred in the
      breasts of Jews, who are children of the ignorant and oppressed&mdash;what
      wonder, since there is hatred in the breasts of Christians? Our national
      life was a growing light. Let the central fire be kindled again, and the
      light will reach afar. The degraded and scorned of our race will learn to
      think of their sacred land, not as a place for saintly beggary to await
      death in loathsome idleness, but as a republic where the Jewish spirit
      manifests itself in a new order founded on the old, purified and enriched
      by the experience our greatest sons have gathered from the life of the
      ages. How long is it?&mdash;only two centuries since a vessel carried over
      the ocean the beginning of the great North American nation. The people
      grew like meeting waters&mdash;they were various in habit and sect&mdash;there
      came a time, a century ago, when they needed a polity, and there were
      heroes of peace among them. What had they to form a polity with but
      memories of Europe, corrected by the vision of a better? Let our wise and
      wealthy show themselves heroes. They have the memories of the East and
      West, and they have the full vision of a better. A new Persia with a
      purified religion magnified itself in art and wisdom. So will a new
      Judaea, poised between East and West&mdash;a covenant of reconciliation.
      Will any say, the prophetic vision of your race has been hopelessly mixed
      with folly and bigotry: the angel of progress has no message for Judaism&mdash;it
      is a half-buried city for the paid workers to lay open&mdash;the waters
      are rushing by it as a forsaken field? I say that the strongest principle
      of growth lies in human choice. The sons of Judah have to choose that God
      may again choose them. The Messianic time is the time when Israel shall
      will the planting of the national ensign. The Nile overflowed and rushed
      onward: the Egyptian could not choose the overflow, but he chose to work
      and make channels for the fructifying waters, and Egypt became the land of
      corn. Shall man, whose soul is set in the royalty of discernment and
      resolve, deny his rank and say, I am an onlooker, ask no choice or purpose
      of me? That is the blasphemy of this time. The divine principle of our
      race is action, choice, resolved memory. Let us contradict the blasphemy,
      and help to will our own better future and the better future of the world&mdash;not
      renounce our higher gift and say, &lsquo;Let us be as if we were not among
      the populations;&rsquo; but choose our full heritage, claim the
      brotherhood of our nation, and carry into it a new brotherhood with the
      nations of the Gentiles. The vision is there; it will be fulfilled.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With the last sentence, which was no more than a loud whisper, Mordecai
      let his chin sink on his breast and his eyelids fall. No one spoke. It was
      not the first time that he had insisted on the same ideas, but he was seen
      to-night in a new phase. The quiet tenacity of his ordinary self differed
      as much from his present exaltation of mood as a man in private talk,
      giving reasons for a revolution of which no sign is discernable, differs
      from one who feels himself an agent in a revolution begun. The dawn of
      fulfillment brought to his hope by Deronda&rsquo;s presence had wrought
      Mordecai&rsquo;s conception into a state of impassioned conviction, and he
      had found strength in his excitement to pour forth the unlocked floods of
      emotive argument, with a sense of haste as at a crisis which must be
      seized. But now there had come with the quiescence of fatigue a sort of
      thankful wonder that he had spoken&mdash;a contemplation of his life as a
      journey which had come at last to this bourne. After a great excitement,
      the ebbing strength of impulse is apt to leave us in this aloofness from
      our active self. And in the moments after Mordecai had sunk his head, his
      mind was wandering along the paths of his youth, and all the hopes which
      had ended in bringing him hither.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one felt that the talk was ended, and the tone of phlegmatic
      discussion made unseasonable by Mordecai&rsquo;s high-pitched solemnity.
      It was as if they had come together to hear the blowing of the <i>shophar</i>,
      and had nothing to do now but to disperse. The movement was unusually
      general, and in less than ten minutes the room was empty of all except
      Mordecai and Deronda. &ldquo;Good-nights&rdquo; had been given to
      Mordecai, but it was evident he had not heard them, for he remained rapt
      and motionless. Deronda would not disturb this needful rest, but waited
      for a spontaneous movement.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;My spirit is too weak; mortality
  Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,
  And each imagined pinnacle and steep
  Of godlike hardship tells me I must die
  Like a sick eagle looking at the sky.&rdquo;
                                     &mdash;KEATS.
</pre>
    <p>
      After a few minutes the unwonted stillness had penetrated Mordecai&rsquo;s
      consciousness, and he looked up at Deronda, not in the least with
      bewilderment and surprise, but with a gaze full of reposing satisfaction.
      Deronda rose and placed his chair nearer, where there could be no imagined
      need for raising the voice. Mordecai felt the action as a patient feels
      the gentleness that eases his pillow. He began to speak in a low tone, as
      if he were only thinking articulately, not trying to reach an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the doctrine of the Cabbala, souls are born again and again in
      new bodies till they are perfected and purified, and a soul liberated from
      a worn-out body may join the fellow-soul that needs it, that they may be
      perfected together, and their earthly work accomplished. Then they will
      depart from the mortal region, and leave place for new souls to be born
      out of the store in the eternal bosom. It is the lingering imperfection of
      the souls already born into the mortal region that hinders the birth of
      new souls and the preparation of the Messianic time:&mdash;thus the mind
      has given shape to what is hidden, as the shadow of what is known, and has
      spoken truth, though it were only in parable. When my long-wandering soul
      is liberated from this weary body, it will join yours, and its work will
      be perfected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai&rsquo;s pause seemed an appeal which Deronda&rsquo;s feeling
      would not let him leave unanswered. He tried to make it truthful; but for
      Mordecai&rsquo;s ear it was inevitably filled with unspoken meaning. He
      only said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything I can in conscience do to make your life effective I
      will do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Mordecai, in a tone of quiet certainty which
      dispenses with further assurance. &ldquo;I heard it. You see it all&mdash;you
      are by my side on the mount of vision, and behold the paths of fulfillment
      which others deny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent a moment or two, and then went on meditatively,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will take up my life where it was broken. I feel myself back in
      that day when my life was broken. The bright morning sun was on the quay&mdash;it
      was at Trieste&mdash;the garments of men from all nations shone like
      jewels&mdash;the boats were pushing off&mdash;the Greek vessel that would
      land us at Beyrout was to start in an hour. I was going with a merchant as
      his clerk and companion. I said, I shall behold the lands and people of
      the East, and I shall speak with a fuller vision. I breathed then as you
      do, without labor; I had the light step and the endurance of youth, I
      could fast, I could sleep on the hard ground. I had wedded poverty, and I
      loved my bride&mdash;for poverty to me was freedom. My heart exulted as if
      it had been the heart of Moses ben Maimon, strong with the strength of
      three score years, and knowing the work that was to fill them. It was the
      first time I had been south; the soul within me felt its former sun; and
      standing on the quay, where the ground I stood on seemed to send forth
      light, and the shadows had an azure glory as of spirits become visible, I
      felt myself in the flood of a glorious life, wherein my own small
      year-counted existence seemed to melt, so that I knew it not; and a great
      sob arose within me as at the rush of waters that were too strong a bliss.
      So I stood there awaiting my companion; and I saw him not till he said:
      &lsquo;Ezra, I have been to the post and there is your letter.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ezra!&rdquo; exclaimed Deronda, unable to contain himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ezra,&rdquo; repeated Mordecai, affirmatively, engrossed in memory.
      &ldquo;I was expecting a letter; for I wrote continually to my mother. And
      that sound of my name was like the touch of a wand that recalled me to the
      body wherefrom I had been released as it were to mingle with the ocean of
      human existence, free from the pressure of individual bondage. I opened
      the letter; and the name came again as a cry that would have disturbed me
      in the bosom of heaven, and made me yearn to reach where that sorrow was&mdash;&lsquo;Ezra,
      my son!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai paused again, his imagination arrested by the grasp of that
      long-passed moment. Deronda&rsquo;s mind was almost breathlessly suspended
      on what was coming. A strange possibility had suddenly presented itself.
      Mordecai&rsquo;s eyes were cast down in abstracted contemplation, and in a
      few moments he went on,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a mother of whom it might have come&mdash;yea, might have
      come to be said, &lsquo;Her children arise up and call her blessed.&rsquo;
      In her I understood the meaning of that Master who, perceiving the
      footsteps of his mother, rose up and said, &lsquo;The Majesty of the
      Eternal cometh near!&rsquo; And that letter was her cry from the depths of
      anguish and desolation&mdash;the cry of a mother robbed of her little
      ones. I was her eldest. Death had taken four babes one after the other.
      Then came, late, my little sister, who was, more than all the rest, the
      desire of my mother&rsquo;s eyes; and the letter was a piercing cry to me&mdash;&lsquo;Ezra,
      my son, I am robbed of her. He has taken her away and left disgrace
      behind. They will never come again.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Here Mordecai
      lifted his eyes suddenly, laid his hand on Deronda&rsquo;s arm, and said,
      &ldquo;Mine was the lot of Israel. For the sin of the father my soul must
      go into exile. For the sin of the father the work was broken, and the day
      of fulfilment delayed. She who bore me was desolate, disgraced, destitute.
      I turned back. On the instant I turned&mdash;her spirit and the spirit of
      her fathers, who had worthy Jewish hearts, moved within me, and drew me.
      God, in whom dwells the universe, was within me as the strength of
      obedience. I turned and traveled with hardship&mdash;to save the scant
      money which she would need. I left the sunshine, and traveled into
      freezing cold. In the last stage I spent a night in exposure to cold and
      snow. And that was the beginning of this slow death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai let his eyes wander again and removed his hand. Deronda
      resolutely repressed the questions which urged themselves within him.
      While Mordecai was in this state of emotion, no other confidence must be
      sought than what came spontaneously: nay, he himself felt a kindred
      emotion which made him dread his own speech as too momentous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I worked. We were destitute&mdash;every thing had been seized.
      And she was ill: the clutch of anguish was too strong for her, and wrought
      with some lurking disease. At times she could not stand for the beating of
      her heart, and the images in her brain became as chambers of terror, where
      she beheld my sister reared in evil. In the dead of night I heard her
      crying for her child. Then I rose, and we stretched forth our arms
      together and prayed. We poured forth our souls in desire that Mirah might
      be delivered from evil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mirah?&rdquo; Deronda repeated, wishing to assure, himself that his
      ears had not been deceived by a forecasting imagination. &ldquo;Did you
      say Mirah?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my little sister&rsquo;s name. After we had prayed for
      her, my mother would rest awhile. It lasted hardly four years, and in the
      minute before she died, we were praying the same prayer&mdash;I aloud, she
      silently. Her soul went out upon its wings.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never since heard of your sister?&rdquo; said Deronda, as
      quietly as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. Never have I heard whether she was delivered according to
      our prayer. I know not, I know not. Who shall say where the pathways lie?
      The poisonous will of the wicked is strong. It poisoned my life&mdash;it
      is slowly stifling this breath. Death delivered my mother, and I felt it a
      blessedness that I was alone in the winters of suffering. But what are the
      winters now?&mdash;they are far off&rdquo;&mdash;here Mordecai again
      rested his hand on Deronda&rsquo;s arm, and looked at him with that joy of
      the hectic patient which pierces us to sadness&mdash;&ldquo;there is
      nothing to wail in the withering of my body. The work will be the better
      done. Once I said the work of this beginning was mine, I am born to do it.
      Well, I shall do it. I shall live in you. I shall live in you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His grasp had become convulsive in its force, and Deronda, agitated as he
      had never been before&mdash;the certainty that this was Mirah&rsquo;s
      brother suffusing his own strange relation to Mordecai with a new
      solemnity and tenderness&mdash;felt his strong young heart beating faster
      and his lips paling. He shrank from speech. He feared, in Mordecai&rsquo;s
      present state of exaltation (already an alarming strain on his feeble
      frame), to utter a word of revelation about Mirah. He feared to make an
      answer below that high pitch of expectation which resembled a flash from a
      dying fire, making watchers fear to see it die the faster. His dominant
      impulse was to do as he had once done before: he laid his firm, gentle
      hand on the hand that grasped him. Mordecai&rsquo;s, as if it had a soul
      of its own&mdash;for he was not distinctly willing to do what he did&mdash;relaxed
      its grasp, and turned upward under Deronda&rsquo;s. As the two palms met
      and pressed each other Mordecai recovered some sense of his surroundings,
      and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go now. I cannot talk any longer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And in fact they parted at Cohen&rsquo;s door without having spoken to
      each other again&mdash;merely with another pressure of the hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda felt a weight on him which was half joy, half anxiety. The joy of
      finding in Mirah&rsquo;s brother a nature even more than worthy of that
      relation to her, had the weight of solemnity and sadness; the reunion of
      brother and sister was in reality the first stage of a supreme parting&mdash;like
      that farewell kiss which resembles greeting, that last glance of love
      which becomes the sharpest pang of sorrow. Then there was the weight of
      anxiety about the revelation of the fact on both sides, and the
      arrangements it would be desirable to make beforehand. I suppose we should
      all have felt as Deronda did, without sinking into snobbishness or the
      notion that the primal duties of life demand a morning and an evening
      suit, that it was an admissible desire to free Mirah&rsquo;s first meeting
      with her brother from all jarring outward conditions. His own sense of
      deliverance from the dreaded relationship of the other Cohens,
      notwithstanding their good nature, made him resolve if possible to keep
      them in the background for Mirah, until her acquaintance with them would
      be an unmarred rendering of gratitude for any kindness they had shown to
      her brother. On all accounts he wished to give Mordecai surroundings not
      only more suited to his frail bodily condition, but less of a hindrance to
      easy intercourse, even apart from the decisive prospect of Mirah&rsquo;s
      taking up her abode with her brother, and tending him through the precious
      remnant of his life. In the heroic drama, great recognitions are not
      encumbered with these details; and certainly Deronda had as reverential an
      interest in Mordecai and Mirah as he could have had in the offspring of
      Agamemnon; but he was caring for destinies still moving in the dim streets
      of our earthly life, not yet lifted among the constellations, and his task
      presented itself to him as difficult and delicate, especially in
      persuading Mordecai to change his abode and habits. Concerning Mirah&rsquo;s
      feeling and resolve he had no doubt: there would be a complete union of
      sentiment toward the departed mother, and Mirah would understand her
      brother&rsquo;s greatness. Yes, greatness: that was the word which Deronda
      now deliberately chose to signify the impression that Mordecai had made on
      him. He said to himself, perhaps rather defiantly toward the more negative
      spirit within him, that this man, however erratic some of his
      interpretations might be&mdash;this consumptive Jewish workman in
      threadbare clothing, lodged by charity, delivering himself to hearers who
      took his thoughts without attaching more consequences to them than the
      Flemings to the ethereal chimes ringing above their market-places&mdash;had
      the chief elements of greatness; a mind consciously, energetically moving
      with the larger march of human destinies, but not the less full of
      conscience and tender heart for the footsteps that tread near and need a
      leaning-place; capable of conceiving and choosing a life&rsquo;s task with
      far-off issues, yet capable of the unapplauded heroism which turns off the
      road of achievement at the call of the nearer duty whose effect lies
      within the beatings of the hearts that are close to us, as the hunger of
      the unfledged bird to the breast of its parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda to-night was stirred with the feeling that the brief remnant of
      this fervid life had become his charge. He had been peculiarly wrought on
      by what he had seen at the club of the friendly indifference which
      Mordecai must have gone on encountering. His own experience of the small
      room that ardor can make for itself in ordinary minds had had the effect
      of increasing his reserve; and while tolerance was the easiest attitude to
      him, there was another bent in him also capable of becoming a weakness&mdash;the
      dislike to appear exceptional or to risk an ineffective insistence on his
      own opinion. But such caution appeared contemptible to him just now, when
      he, for the first time, saw in a complete picture and felt as a reality
      the lives that burn themselves out in solitary enthusiasm: martyrs of
      obscure circumstance, exiled in the rarity of their own minds, whose
      deliverances in other ears are no more than a long passionate soliloquy&mdash;unless
      perhaps at last, when they are nearing the invisible shores, signs of
      recognition and fulfilment may penetrate the cloud of loneliness; or
      perhaps it may be with them as with the dying Copernicus made to touch the
      first printed copy of his book when the sense of touch was gone, seeing it
      only as a dim object through the deepening dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda had been brought near to one of those spiritual exiles, and it was
      in his nature to feel the relation as a strong chain, nay, to feel his
      imagination moving without repugnance in the direction of Mordecai&rsquo;s
      desires. With all his latent objection to schemes only definite in their
      generality and nebulous in detail&mdash;in the poise of his sentiments he
      felt at one with this man who had made a visionary selection of him: the
      lines of what may be called their emotional theory touched. He had not the
      Jewish consciousness, but he had a yearning, grown the stronger for the
      denial which had been his grievance, after the obligation of avowed filial
      and social ties. His feeling was ready for difficult obedience. In this
      way it came that he set about his new task ungrudgingly; and again he
      thought of Mrs. Meyrick as his chief helper. To her first he must make
      known the discovery of Mirah&rsquo;s brother, and with her he must consult
      on all preliminaries of bringing the mutually lost together. Happily the
      best quarter for a consumptive patient did not lie too far off the small
      house at Chelsea, and the first office Deronda had to perform for this
      Hebrew prophet who claimed him as a spiritual inheritor, was to get him a
      healthy lodging. Such is the irony of earthly mixtures, that the heroes
      have not always had carpets and teacups of their own; and, seen through
      the open window by the mackerel-vender, may have been invited with some
      hopefulness to pay three hundred per cent, in the form of fourpence.
      However, Deronda&rsquo;s mind was busy with a prospective arrangement for
      giving a furnished lodging some faint likeness to a refined home by
      dismantling his own chambers of his best old books in vellum, his easiest
      chair, and the bas-reliefs of Milton and Dante.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was not Mirah to be there? What furniture can give such finish to a
      room as a tender woman&rsquo;s face?&mdash;and is there any harmony of
      tints that has such stirrings of delight as the sweet modulation of her
      voice? Here is one good, at least, thought Deronda, that comes to Mordecai
      from his having fixed his imagination on me. He has recovered a perfect
      sister, whose affection is waiting for him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Fairy folk a-listening
  Hear the seed sprout in the spring.
  And for music to their dance
  Hear the hedgerows wake from trance,
  Sap that trembles into buds
  Sending little rhythmic floods
  Of fairy sound in fairy ears.
  Thus all beauty that appears
  Has birth as sound to finer sense
  And lighter-clad intelligence.
</pre>
    <p>
      And Gwendolen? She was thinking of Deronda much more than he was thinking
      of her&mdash;often wondering what were his ideas &ldquo;about things,&rdquo;
      and how his life was occupied. But a lap-dog would be necessarily at a
      loss in framing to itself the motives and adventures of doghood at large;
      and it was as far from Gwendolen&rsquo;s conception that Deronda&rsquo;s
      life could be determined by the historical destiny of the Jews, as that he
      could rise into the air on a brazen horse, and so vanish from her horizon
      in the form of a twinkling star.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all the sense of inferiority that had been forced upon her, it was
      inevitable that she should imagine a larger place for herself in his
      thoughts than she actually possessed. They must be rather old and wise
      persons who are not apt to see their own anxiety or elation about
      themselves reflected in other minds; and Gwendolen, with her youth and
      inward solitude, may be excused for dwelling on signs of special interest
      in her shown by the one person who had impressed her with the feeling of
      submission, and for mistaking the color and proportion of those signs in
      the mind of Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, what would he tell her that she ought to do? &ldquo;He said, I
      must get more interest in others, and more knowledge, and that I must care
      about the best things&mdash;but how am I to begin?&rdquo; She wondered
      what books he would tell her to take up to her own room, and recalled the
      famous writers that she had either not looked into or had found the most
      unreadable, with a half-smiling wish that she could mischievously ask
      Deronda if they were not the books called &ldquo;medicine for the mind.&rdquo;
      Then she repented of her sauciness, and when she was safe from observation
      carried up a miscellaneous selection&mdash;Descartes, Bacon, Locke,
      Butler, Burke, Guizot&mdash;knowing, as a clever young lady of education,
      that these authors were ornaments of mankind, feeling sure that Deronda
      had read them, and hoping that by dipping into them all in succession,
      with her rapid understanding she might get a point of view nearer to his
      level.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was astonishing how little time she found for these vast mental
      excursions. Constantly she had to be on the scene as Mrs. Grandcourt, and
      to feel herself watched in that part by the exacting eyes of a husband who
      had found a motive to exercise his tenacity&mdash;that of making his
      marriage answer all the ends he chose, and with the more completeness the
      more he discerned any opposing will in her. And she herself, whatever
      rebellion might be going on within her, could not have made up her mind to
      failure in her representation. No feeling had yet reconciled her for a
      moment to any act, word, or look that would be a confession to the world:
      and what she most dreaded in herself was any violent impulse that would
      make an involuntary confession: it was the will to be silent in every
      other direction that had thrown the more impetuosity into her confidences
      toward Deronda, to whom her thought continually turned as a help against
      herself. Her riding, her hunting, her visiting and receiving of visits,
      were all performed in a spirit of achievement which served instead of zest
      and young gladness, so that all around Diplow, in those weeks of the new
      year, Mrs. Grandcourt was regarded as wearing her honors with triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She disguises it under an air of taking everything as a matter of
      course,&rdquo; said Mrs. Arrowpoint. &ldquo;A stranger might suppose that
      she had condescended rather than risen. I always noticed that doubleness
      in her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To her mother most of all Gwendolen was bent on acting complete
      satisfaction, and poor Mrs. Davilow was so far deceived that she took the
      unexpected distance at which she was kept, in spite of what she felt to be
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s handsome behavior in providing for her, as a
      comparative indifference in her daughter, now that marriage had created
      new interests. To be fetched to lunch and then to dinner along with the
      Gascoignes, to be driven back soon after breakfast the next morning, and
      to have brief calls from Gwendolen in which her husband waited for her
      outside either on horseback or sitting in the carriage, was all the
      intercourse allowed to her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was, that the second time Gwendolen proposed to invite her
      mother with Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne, Grandcourt had at first been silent,
      and then drawled, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be having <i>those people</i>
      always. Gascoigne talks too much. Country clergy are always bores&mdash;with
      their confounded fuss about everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That speech was full of foreboding for Gwendolen. To have her mother
      classed under &ldquo;those people&rdquo; was enough to confirm the
      previous dread of bringing her too near. Still, she could not give the
      true reasons&mdash;she could not say to her mother, &ldquo;Mr. Grandcourt
      wants to recognize you as little as possible; and besides it is better you
      should not see much of my married life, else you might find out that I am
      miserable.&rdquo; So she waived as lightly as she could every allusion to
      the subject; and when Mrs. Davilow again hinted the possibility of her
      having a house close to Ryelands, Gwendolen said, &ldquo;It would not be
      so nice for you as being near the rectory here, mamma. We shall perhaps be
      very little at Ryelands. You would miss my aunt and uncle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the while this contemptuous veto of her husband&rsquo;s on any
      intimacy with her family, making her proudly shrink from giving them the
      aspect of troublesome pensioners, was rousing more inward inclination
      toward them. She had never felt so kindly toward her uncle, so much
      disposed to look back on his cheerful, complacent activity and spirit of
      kind management, even when mistaken, as more of a comfort than the neutral
      loftiness which was every day chilling her. And here perhaps she was
      unconsciously finding some of that mental enlargement which it was hard to
      get from her occasional dashes into difficult authors, who instead of
      blending themselves with her daily agitations required her to dismiss
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a delightful surprise one day when Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne were at
      Offendene to see Gwendolen ride up without her husband&mdash;with the
      groom only. All, including the four girls and Miss Merry, seated in the
      dining-room at lunch, could see the welcome approach; and even the elder
      ones were not without something of Isabel&rsquo;s romantic sense that the
      beautiful sister on the splendid chestnut, which held its head as if proud
      to bear her, was a sort of Harriet Byron or Miss Wardour reappearing out
      of her &ldquo;happiness ever after.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle went to the door to give her his hand, and she sprang from her
      horse with an air of alacrity which might well encourage that notion of
      guaranteed happiness; for Gwendolen was particularly bent to-day on
      setting her mother&rsquo;s heart at rest, and her unusual sense of freedom
      in being able to make this visit alone enabled her to bear up under the
      pressure of painful facts which were urging themselves anew. The seven
      family kisses were not so tiresome as they used to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Grandcourt is gone out, so I determined to fill up the time by
      coming to you, mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, as she laid down her hat and
      seated herself next to her mother; and then looking at her with a
      playfully monitory air, &ldquo;That is a punishment to you for not wearing
      better lace on your head. You didn&rsquo;t think I should come and detect
      you&mdash;you dreadfully careless-about-yourself mamma!&rdquo; She gave a
      caressing touch to the dear head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scold me, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, her delicate worn face
      flushing with delight. &ldquo;But I wish there was something you could eat
      after your ride&mdash;instead of these scraps. Let Jocosa make you a cup
      of chocolate in your old way. You used to like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Merry immediately rose and went out, though Gwendolen said, &ldquo;Oh,
      no, a piece of bread, or one of those hard biscuits. I can&rsquo;t think
      about eating. I am come to say good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! going to Ryelands again?&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we are going to town,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, beginning to break
      up a piece of bread, but putting no morsel into her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather early to go to town,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gascoigne,
      &ldquo;and Mr. Grandcourt not in Parliament.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is only one more day&rsquo;s hunting to be had, and
      Henleigh has some business in town with lawyers, I think,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen. &ldquo;I am very glad. I shall like to go to town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see your house in Grosvenor Square,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow. She and the girls were devouring with their eyes every movement
      of their goddess, soon to vanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, in a tone of assent to the interest of
      that expectation. &ldquo;And there is so much to be seen and done in town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish, my dear Gwendolen,&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne, in a kind of
      cordial advice, &ldquo;that you would use your influence with Mr.
      Grandcourt to induce him to enter Parliament. A man of his position should
      make his weight felt in politics. The best judges are confident that the
      ministry will have to appeal to the country on this question of further
      Reform, and Mr. Grandcourt should be ready for the opportunity. I am not
      quite sure that his opinions and mine accord entirely; I have not heard
      him express himself very fully. But I don&rsquo;t look at the matter from
      that point of view. I am thinking of your husband&rsquo;s standing in the
      country. And he has now come to that stage of life when a man like him
      should enter into public affairs. A wife has great influence with her
      husband. Use yours in that direction, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector felt that he was acquitting himself of a duty here, and giving
      something like the aspect of a public benefit to his niece&rsquo;s match.
      To Gwendolen the whole speech had the flavor of bitter comedy. If she had
      been merry, she must have laughed at her uncle&rsquo;s explanation to her
      that he had not heard Grandcourt express himself very fully on politics.
      And the wife&rsquo;s great influence! General maxims about husbands and
      wives seemed now of a precarious usefulness. Gwendolen herself had once
      believed in her future influence as an omnipotence in managing&mdash;she
      did not know exactly what. But her chief concern at present was to give an
      answer that would be felt appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very glad, uncle. But I think Mr. Grandcourt would not
      like the trouble of an election&mdash;at least, unless it could be without
      his making speeches. I thought candidates always made speeches.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not necessarily&mdash;to any great extent,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Gascoigne. &ldquo;A man of position and weight can get on without much of
      it. A county member need have very little trouble in that way, and both
      out of the House and in it is liked the better for not being a
      speechifier. Tell Mr. Grandcourt that I say so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes Jocosa with my chocolate after all,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, escaping from a promise to give information that would
      certainly have been received in a way inconceivable to the good rector,
      who, pushing his chair a little aside from the table and crossing his leg,
      looked as well as if he felt like a worthy specimen of a clergyman and
      magistrate giving experienced advice. Mr. Gascoigne had come to the
      conclusion that Grandcourt was a proud man, but his own self-love, calmed
      through life by the consciousness of his general value and personal
      advantages, was not irritable enough to prevent him from hoping the best
      about his niece&rsquo;s husband because her uncle was kept rather
      haughtily at a distance. A certain aloofness must be allowed to the
      representative of an old family; you would not expect him to be on
      intimate terms even with abstractions. But Mrs. Gascoigne was less
      dispassionate on her husband&rsquo;s account, and felt Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      haughtiness as something a little blameable in Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle and Anna will very likely be in town about Easter,&rdquo;
      she said, with a vague sense of expressing a slight discontent. &ldquo;Dear
      Rex hopes to come out with honors and a fellowship, and he wants his
      father and Anna to meet him in London, that they may be jolly together, as
      he says. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if Lord Brackenshaw invited them, he has
      been so very kind since he came back to the Castle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope my uncle will bring Ann to stay in Grosvenor Square,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, risking herself so far, for the sake of the present
      moment, but in reality wishing that she might never be obliged to bring
      any of her family near Grandcourt again. &ldquo;I am very glad of Rex&rsquo;s
      good fortune.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must not be premature, and rejoice too much beforehand,&rdquo;
      said the rector, to whom this topic was the happiest in the world, and
      altogether allowable, now that the issue of that little affair about
      Gwendolen had been so satisfactory. &ldquo;Not but that I am in
      correspondence with impartial judges, who have the highest hopes about my
      son, as a singularly clear-headed young man. And of his excellent
      disposition and principle I have had the best evidence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have him a great lawyer some time,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Gascoigne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very nice!&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a concealed scepticism
      as to niceness in general, which made the word quite applicable to
      lawyers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking of Lord Brackenshaw&rsquo;s kindness,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know how delightful he has been,
      Gwendolen. He has begged me to consider myself his guest in this house
      till I can get another that I like&mdash;he did it in the most graceful
      way. But now a house has turned up. Old Mr. Jodson is dead, and we can
      have his house. It is just what I want; small, but with nothing hideous to
      make you miserable thinking about it. And it is only a mile from the
      Rectory. You remember the low white house nearly hidden by the trees, as
      we turn up the lane to the church?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you have no furniture, poor mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      in a melancholy tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am saving money for that. You know who has made me rather
      rich, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow, laying her hand on Gwendolen&rsquo;s.
      &ldquo;And Jocosa really makes so little do for housekeeping&mdash;it is
      quite wonderful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please let me go up-stairs with you and arrange my hat, mamma,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, suddenly putting up her hand to her hair and perhaps
      creating a desired disarrangement. Her heart was swelling, and she was
      ready to cry. Her mother <i>must</i> have been worse off, if it had not
      been for Grandcourt. &ldquo;I suppose I shall never see all this again,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, looking round her, as they entered the black and yellow
      bedroom, and then throwing herself into a chair in front of the glass with
      a little groan as of bodily fatigue. In the resolve not to cry she had
      become very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not well, dear?&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that chocolate has made me sick,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, putting
      up her hand to be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be allowed to come to you if you were ill, darling,&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Davilow, rather timidly, as she pressed the hand to her bosom.
      Something had made her sure today that her child loved her&mdash;needed
      her as much as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, leaning her head against her
      mother, though speaking as lightly as she could. &ldquo;But you know I
      never am ill. I am as strong as possible; and you must not take to
      fretting about me, but make yourself as happy as you can with the girls.
      They are better children to you than I have been, you know.&rdquo; She
      turned up her face with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have always been good, my darling. I remember nothing else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what did I ever do that was good to you, except marry Mr.
      Grandcourt?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, starting up with a desperate resolve to
      be playful, and keep no more on the perilous edge of agitation. &ldquo;And
      I should not have done that unless it had pleased myself.&rdquo; She
      tossed up her chin, and reached her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid, child! I would not have had you marry for my sake. Your
      happiness by itself is half mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, arranging her hat fastidiously,
      &ldquo;then you will please to consider that you are half happy, which is
      more than I am used to seeing you.&rdquo; With the last words she again
      turned with her old playful smile to her mother. &ldquo;Now I am ready;
      but oh, mamma, Mr. Grandcourt gives me a quantity of money, and expects me
      to spend it, and I can&rsquo;t spend it; and you know I can&rsquo;t bear
      charity children and all that; and here are thirty pounds. I wish the
      girls would spend it for me on little things for themselves when you go to
      the new house. Tell them so.&rdquo; Gwendolen put the notes into her
      mother&rsquo;s hands and looked away hastily, moving toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Davilow. &ldquo;It will
      please them so that you should have thought of them in particular.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they are troublesome things; but they don&rsquo;t trouble me
      now,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, turning and nodding playfully. She hardly
      understood her own feeling in this act toward her sisters, but at any rate
      she did not wish it to be taken as anything serious. She was glad to have
      got out of the bedroom without showing more signs of emotion, and she went
      through the rest of her visit and all the good-byes with a quiet propriety
      that made her say to herself sarcastically as she rode away, &ldquo;I
      think I am making a very good Mrs. Grandcourt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She believed that her husband had gone to Gadsmere that day&mdash;had
      inferred this, as she had long ago inferred who were the inmates of what
      he had described as &ldquo;a dog-hutch of a place in a black country;&rdquo;
      and the strange conflict of feeling within her had had the characteristic
      effect of sending her to Offendene with a tightened resolve&mdash;a form
      of excitement which was native to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered at her own contradictions. Why should she feel it bitter to
      her that Grandcourt showed concern for the beings on whose account she
      herself was undergoing remorse? Had she not before her marriage inwardly
      determined to speak and act on their behalf?&mdash;and since he had lately
      implied that he wanted to be in town because he was making arrangements
      about his will, she ought to have been glad of any sign that he kept a
      conscience awake toward those at Gadsmere; and yet, now that she was a
      wife, the sense that Grandcourt was gone to Gadsmere was like red heat
      near a burn. She had brought on herself this indignity in her own eyes&mdash;this
      humiliation of being doomed to a terrified silence lest her husband should
      discover with what sort of consciousness she had married him; and as she
      had said to Deronda, she &ldquo;must go on.&rdquo; After the intense
      moments of secret hatred toward this husband who from the very first had
      cowed her, there always came back the spiritual pressure which made
      submission inevitable. There was no effort at freedoms that would not
      bring fresh and worse humiliation. Gwendolen could dare nothing except an
      impulsive action&mdash;least of all could she dare premeditatedly a vague
      future in which the only certain condition was indignity. In spite of
      remorse, it still seemed the worst result of her marriage that she should
      in any way make a spectacle of herself; and her humiliation was lightened
      by her thinking that only Mrs. Glasher was aware of the fact which caused
      it. For Gwendolen had never referred the interview at the Whispering
      Stones to Lush&rsquo;s agency; her disposition to vague terror investing
      with shadowy omnipresence any threat of fatal power over her, and so
      hindering her from imagining plans and channels by which news had been
      conveyed to the woman who had the poisoning skill of a sorceress. To
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s mind the secret lay with Mrs. Glasher, and there were
      words in the horrible letter which implied that Mrs. Glasher would dread
      disclosure to the husband, as much as the usurping Mrs. Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something else, too, she thought of as more of a secret from her husband
      than it really was&mdash;namely that suppressed struggle of desperate
      rebellion which she herself dreaded. Grandcourt could not indeed fully
      imagine how things affected Gwendolen: he had no imagination of anything
      in her but what affected the gratification of his own will; but on this
      point he had the sensibility which seems like divination. What we see
      exclusively we are apt to see with some mistake of proportions; and
      Grandcourt was not likely to be infallible in his judgments concerning
      this wife who was governed by many shadowy powers, to him nonexistent. He
      magnified her inward resistance, but that did not lessen his satisfaction
      in the mastery of it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Behold my lady&rsquo;s carriage stop the way.
  With powdered lacquey and with charming bay;
  She sweeps the matting, treads the crimson stair.
  Her arduous function solely &ldquo;to be there.&rdquo;
   Like Sirius rising o&rsquo;er the silent sea.
  She hides her heart in lustre loftily.
</pre>
    <p>
      So the Grandcourts were in Grosvenor Square in time to receive a card for
      the musical party at Lady Mallinger&rsquo;s, there being reasons of
      business which made Sir Hugo know beforehand that his ill-beloved nephew
      was coming up. It was only the third evening after their arrival, and
      Gwendolen made rather an absent-minded acquaintance with her new ceilings
      and furniture, preoccupied with the certainty that she was going to speak
      to Deronda again, and also to see the Miss Lapidoth who had gone through
      so much, and was &ldquo;capable of submitting to anything in the form of
      duty.&rdquo; For Gwendolen had remembered nearly every word that Deronda
      had said about Mirah, and especially that phrase, which she repeated to
      herself bitterly, having an ill-defined consciousness that her own
      submission was something very different. She would have been obliged to
      allow, if any one had said it to her, that what she submitted to could not
      take the shape of duty, but was submission to a yoke drawn on her by an
      action she was ashamed of, and worn with a strength of selfish motives
      that left no weight for duty to carry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawing-rooms in Park Lane, all white, gold, and pale crimson, were
      agreeably furnished, and not crowded with guests, before Mr. and Mrs.
      Grandcourt entered; and more than half an hour of instrumental music was
      being followed by an interval of movement and chat. Klesmer was there with
      his wife, and in his generous interest for Mirah he proposed to accompany
      her singing of Leo&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>O patria mia</i>,&rdquo; which he had
      before recommended her to choose, as more distinctive of her than better
      known music. He was already at the piano, and Mirah was standing there
      conspicuously, when Gwendolen, magnificent in her pale green velvet and
      poisoned diamonds, was ushered to a seat of honor well in view of them.
      With her long sight and self-command she had the rare power of quickly
      distinguishing persons and objects on entering a full room, and while
      turning her glance toward Mirah she did not neglect to exchange a bow with
      Klesmer as she passed. The smile seemed to each a lightning-flash back on
      that morning when it had been her ambition to stand as the &ldquo;little
      Jewess&rdquo; was standing, and survey a grand audience from the higher
      rank of her talent&mdash;instead of which she was one of the ordinary
      crowd in silk and gems, whose utmost performance it must be to admire or
      find fault. &ldquo;He thinks I am in the right road now,&rdquo; said the
      lurking resentment within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen had not caught sight of Deronda in her passage, and while she
      was seated acquitting herself in chat with Sir Hugo, she glanced round her
      with careful ease, bowing a recognition here and there, and fearful lest
      an anxious-looking exploration in search of Deronda might be observed by
      her husband, and afterward rebuked as something &ldquo;damnably vulgar.&rdquo;
      But all traveling, even that of a slow gradual glance round a room, brings
      a liability to undesired encounters, and amongst the eyes that met
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s, forcing her into a slight bow, were those of the
      &ldquo;amateur too fond of Meyerbeer,&rdquo; Mr. Lush, whom Sir Hugo
      continued to find useful as a half-caste among gentlemen. He was standing
      near her husband, who, however, turned a shoulder toward him, and was
      being understood to listen to Lord Pentreath. How was it that at this
      moment, for the first time, there darted through Gwendolen, like a
      disagreeable sensation, the idea that this man knew all about her husband&rsquo;s
      life? He had been banished from her sight, according to her will, and she
      had been satisfied; he had sunk entirely into the background of her
      thoughts, screened away from her by the agitating figures that kept up an
      inward drama in which Lush had no place. Here suddenly he reappeared at
      her husband&rsquo;s elbow, and there sprang up in her, like an
      instantaneously fabricated memory in a dream, the sense of his being
      connected with the secrets that made her wretched. She was conscious of
      effort in turning her head away from him, trying to continue her wandering
      survey as if she had seen nothing of more consequence than the picture on
      the wall, till she discovered Deronda. But he was not looking toward her,
      and she withdrew her eyes from him, without having got any recognition,
      consoling herself with the assurance that he must have seen her come in.
      In fact, he was not standing far from the door with Hans Meyrick, whom he
      had been careful to bring into Lady Mallinger&rsquo;s list. They were both
      a little more anxious than was comfortable lest Mirah should not be heard
      to advantage. Deronda even felt himself on the brink of betraying emotion,
      Mirah&rsquo;s presence now being linked with crowding images of what had
      gone before and was to come after&mdash;all centering in the brother he
      was soon to reveal to her; and he had escaped as soon as he could from the
      side of Lady Pentreath, who had said in her violoncello voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your Jewess is pretty&mdash;there&rsquo;s no denying that.
      But where is her Jewish impudence? She looks as demure as a nun. I suppose
      she learned that on the stage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was beginning to feel on Mirah&rsquo;s behalf something of what he had
      felt for himself in his seraphic boyish time, when Sir Hugo asked him if
      he would like to be a great singer&mdash;an indignant dislike to her being
      remarked on in a free and easy way, as if she were an imported commodity
      disdainfully paid for by the fashionable public, and he winced the more
      because Mordecai, he knew, would feel that the name &ldquo;Jewess&rdquo;
      was taken as a sort of stamp like the lettering of Chinese silk. In this
      susceptible mood he saw the Grandcourts enter, and was immediately
      appealed to by Hans about &ldquo;that Vandyke duchess of a beauty.&rdquo;
      Pray excuse Deronda that in this moment he felt a transient renewal of his
      first repulsion from Gwendolen, as if she and her beauty and her failings
      were to blame for the undervaluing of Mirah as a woman&mdash;a feeling
      something like class animosity, which affection for what is not fully
      recognized by others, whether in persons or in poetry, rarely allows us to
      escape. To Hans admiring Gwendolen with his habitual hyperbole, he
      answered, with a sarcasm that was not quite good-natured,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you could admire no style of woman but your Berenice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the style I worship&mdash;not admire,&rdquo; said Hans.
      &ldquo;Other styles of women I might make myself wicked for, but for
      Berenice I could make myself&mdash;well, pretty good, which is something
      much more difficult.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said Deronda, under the pretext that the singing was
      going to begin. He was not so delighted with the answer as might have been
      expected, and was relieved by Hans&rsquo;s movement to a more advanced
      spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda had never before heard Mirah sing &ldquo;<i>O patria mia</i>.&rdquo;
      He knew well Leopardi&rsquo;s fine Ode to Italy (when Italy sat like a
      disconsolate mother in chains, hiding her face on her knees and weeping),
      and the few selected words were filled for him with the grandeur of the
      whole, which seemed to breathe an inspiration through the music. Mirah
      singing this, made Mordecai more than ever one presence with her. Certain
      words not included in the song nevertheless rang within Deronda as
      harmonies from the invisible,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;Non ti difende
  Nessun dè tuoi! L&rsquo;armi, qua l&rsquo;armi: io solo
  Combatteró, procomberó sol io&rdquo;&mdash;
[Footnote: Do none of thy children defend thee? Arms! bring me arms!
alone I will fight, alone I will fall.]
</pre>
    <p>
      they seemed the very voice of that heroic passion which is falsely said to
      devote itself in vain when it achieves the god-like end of manifesting
      unselfish love. And that passion was present to Deronda now as the vivid
      image of a man dying helplessly away from the possibility of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah was equal to his wishes. While the general applause was sounding,
      Klesmer gave a more valued testimony, audible to her only&mdash;&ldquo;Good,
      good&mdash;the crescendo better than before.&rdquo; But her chief anxiety
      was to know that she had satisfied Mr. Deronda: any failure on her part
      this evening would have pained her as an especial injury to him. Of course
      all her prospects were due to what he had done for her; still, this
      occasion of singing in the house that was his home brought a peculiar
      demand. She looked toward him in the distance, and he saw that she did;
      but he remained where he was, and watched the streams of emulous admirers
      closing round her, till presently they parted to make way for Gwendolen,
      who was taken up to be introduced by Mrs. Klesmer. Easier now about
      &ldquo;the little Jewess,&rdquo; Daniel relented toward poor Gwendolen in
      her splendor, and his memory went back, with some penitence for his
      momentary hardness, over all the signs and confessions that she too needed
      a rescue, and one much more difficult than that of the wanderer by the
      river&mdash;a rescue for which he felt himself helpless. The silent
      question&mdash;&ldquo;But is it not cowardly to make that a reason for
      turning away?&rdquo; was the form in which he framed his resolve to go
      near her on the first opportunity, and show his regard for her past
      confidence, in spite of Sir Hugo&rsquo;s unwelcome hints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Klesmer, having risen to Gwendolen as she approached, and being included
      by her in the opening conversation with Mirah, continued near them a
      little while, looking down with a smile, which was rather in his eyes than
      on his lips, at the piquant contrast of the two charming young creatures
      seated on the red divan. The solicitude seemed to be all on the side of
      the splendid one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must let me say how much I am obliged to you,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen. &ldquo;I had heard from Mr. Deronda that I should have a great
      treat in your singing, but I was too ignorant to imagine how great.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good to say so,&rdquo; answered Mirah, her mind
      chiefly occupied in contemplating Gwendolen. It was like a new kind of
      stage-experience to her to be close to genuine grand ladies with genuine
      brilliants and complexions, and they impressed her vaguely as coming out
      of some unknown drama, in which their parts perhaps got more tragic as
      they went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall all want to learn of you&mdash;I, at least,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen. &ldquo;I sing very badly, as Herr Klesmer will tell you,&rdquo;&mdash;here
      she glanced upward to that higher power rather archly, and continued&mdash;&ldquo;but
      I have been rebuked for not liking to be middling, since I can be nothing
      more. I think that is a different doctrine from yours?&rdquo; She was
      still looking at Klesmer, who said quickly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if it means that it would be worth while for you to study
      further, and for Miss Lapidoth to have the pleasure of helping you.&rdquo;
      With that he moved away, and Mirah taking everything with <i>naïve</i>
      seriousness, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think I could teach you, I shall be very glad. I am anxious
      to teach, but I have only just begun. If I do it well, it must be by
      remembering how my master taught me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen was in reality too uncertain about herself to be prepared for
      this simple promptitude of Mirah&rsquo;s, and in her wish to change the
      subject, said, with some lapse from the good taste of her first address,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not been long in London, I think?&mdash;but you were
      perhaps introduced to Mr. Deronda abroad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mirah; &ldquo;I never saw him before I came to
      England in the summer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has seen you often and heard you sing a great deal, has he
      not?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, led on partly by the wish to hear anything
      about Deronda, and partly by the awkwardness which besets the readiest
      person, in carrying on a dialogue when empty of matter. &ldquo;He spoke of
      you to me with the highest praise. He seemed to know you quite well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was poor and needed help,&rdquo; said Mirah, in a new tone of
      feeling, &ldquo;and Mr. Deronda has given me the best friends in the
      world. That is the only way he came to know anything about me&mdash;because
      he was sorry for me. I had no friends when I came. I was in distress. I
      owe everything to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Gwendolen, who had wanted to be a struggling artist herself, could
      nevertheless not escape the impression that a mode of inquiry which would
      have been rather rude toward herself was an amiable condescension to this
      Jewess who was ready to give her lessons. The only effect on Mirah, as
      always on any mention of Deronda, was to stir reverential gratitude and
      anxiety that she should be understood to have the deepest obligation to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But both he and Hans, who were noticing the pair from a distance, would
      have felt rather indignant if they had known that the conversation had led
      up to Mirah&rsquo;s representation of herself in this light of neediness.
      In the movement that prompted her, however, there was an exquisite
      delicacy, which perhaps she could not have stated explicitly&mdash;the
      feeling that she ought not to allow any one to assume in Deronda a
      relation of more equality or less generous interest toward her than
      actually existed. Her answer was delightful to Gwendolen: she thought of
      nothing but the ready compassion which in another form she had trusted in
      and found herself; and on the signals that Klesmer was about to play she
      moved away in much content, entirely without presentiment that this Jewish
      <i>protégé</i> would ever make a more important difference in her life
      than the possible improvement of her singing&mdash;if the leisure and
      spirits of a Mrs. Grandcourt would allow of other lessons than such as the
      world was giving her at rather a high charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her wonted alternation from resolute care of appearances to some rash
      indulgence of an impulse, she chose, under the pretext of getting farther
      from the instrument, not to go again to her former seat, but placed
      herself on a settee where she could only have one neighbor. She was nearer
      to Deronda than before: was it surprising that he came up in time to shake
      hands before the music began&mdash;then, that after he had stood a little
      while by the elbow of the settee at the empty end, the torrent-like
      confluences of bass and treble seemed, like a convulsion of nature, to
      cast the conduct of petty mortals into insignificance, and to warrant his
      sitting down?
    </p>
    <p>
      But when at the end of Klesmer&rsquo;s playing there came the outburst of
      talk under which Gwendolen had hoped to speak as she would to Deronda, she
      observed that Mr. Lush was within hearing, leaning against the wall close
      by them. She could not help her flush of anger, but she tried to have only
      an air of polite indifference in saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Lapidoth is everything you described her to be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been very quick in discovering that,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not found out all the excellencies you spoke of&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      mean that,&rdquo; said Gwendolen; &ldquo;but I think her singing is
      charming, and herself, too. Her face is lovely&mdash;not in the least
      common; and she is such a complete little person. I should think she will
      be a great success.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech was grating on Deronda, and he would not answer it, but looked
      gravely before him. She knew that he was displeased with her, and she was
      getting so impatient under the neighborhood of Mr. Lush, which prevented
      her from saying any word she wanted to say, that she meditated some
      desperate step to get rid of it, and remained silent, too. That constraint
      seemed to last a long while, neither Gwendolen nor Deronda looking at the
      other, till Lush slowly relieved the wall of his weight, and joined some
      one at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen immediately said, &ldquo;You despise me for talking
      artificially.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Deronda, looking at her coolly; &ldquo;I think that
      is quite excusable sometimes. But I did not think what you were last
      saying was altogether artificial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was something in it that displeased you,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen. &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible to explain such things,&rdquo; said Deronda.
      &ldquo;One can never communicate niceties of feeling about words and
      manner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I am shut out from understanding them,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, with a slight tremor in her voice, which she was trying to
      conquer. &ldquo;Have I shown myself so very dense to everything you have
      said?&rdquo; There was an indescribable look of suppressed tears in her
      eyes, which were turned on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Deronda, with some softening of voice.
      &ldquo;But experience differs for different people. We don&rsquo;t all
      wince at the same things. I have had plenty of proof that you are not
      dense.&rdquo; He smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one may feel things and are not able to do anything better for
      all that,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, not smiling in return&mdash;the distance
      to which Deronda&rsquo;s words seemed to throw her chilling her too much.
      &ldquo;I begin to think we can only get better by having people about us
      who raise good feelings. You must not be surprised at anything in me. I
      think it is too late for me to alter. I don&rsquo;t know how to set about
      being wise, as you told me to be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seldom find I do any good by my preaching. I might as well have
      kept from meddling,&rdquo; said Deronda, thinking rather sadly that his
      interference about that unfortunate necklace might end in nothing but an
      added pain to him in seeing her after all hardened to another sort of
      gambling than roulette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, hurriedly, feeling
      that this might be her only chance of getting the words uttered, and
      dreading the increase of her own agitation. &ldquo;If you despair of me, I
      shall despair. Your saying that I should not go on being selfish and
      ignorant has been some strength to me. If you say you wish you had not
      meddled&mdash;that means you despair of me and forsake me. And then you
      will decide for me that I shall not be good. It is you who will decide;
      because you might have made me different by keeping as near to me as you
      could, and believing in me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not been looking at him as she spoke, but at the handle of the fan
      which she held closed. With the last words she rose and left him,
      returning to her former place, which had been left vacant; while every one
      was settling into quietude in expectation of Mirah&rsquo;s voice, which
      presently, with that wonderful, searching quality of subdued song in which
      the melody seems simply an effect of the emotion, gave forth, <i>Per pietà
      non dirmi addio</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Deronda&rsquo;s ear the strain was for the moment a continuance of
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s pleading&mdash;a painful urging of something vague and
      difficult, irreconcilable with pressing conditions, and yet cruel to
      resist. However strange the mixture in her of a resolute pride and a
      precocious air of knowing the world, with a precipitate, guileless
      indiscretion, he was quite sure now that the mixture existed. Sir Hugo&rsquo;s
      hints had made him alive to dangers that his own disposition might have
      neglected; but that Gwendolen&rsquo;s reliance on him was unvisited by any
      dream of his being a man who could misinterpret her was as manifest as
      morning, and made an appeal which wrestled with his sense of present
      dangers, and with his foreboding of a growing incompatible claim on him in
      her mind. There was a foreshadowing of some painful collision: on the one
      side the grasp of Mordecai&rsquo;s dying hand on him, with all the ideals
      and prospects it aroused; on the other the fair creature in silk and gems,
      with her hidden wound and her self-dread, making a trustful effort to lean
      and find herself sustained. It was as if he had a vision of himself
      besought with outstretched arms and cries, while he was caught by the
      waves and compelled to mount the vessel bound for a far-off coast. That
      was the strain of excited feeling in him that went along with the notes of
      Mirah&rsquo;s song; but when it ceased he moved from his seat with the
      reflection that he had been falling into an exaggeration of his own
      importance, and a ridiculous readiness to accept Gwendolen&rsquo;s view of
      himself, as if he could really have any decisive power over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an enviable fellow you are,&rdquo; said Hans to him, &ldquo;sitting
      on a sofa with that young duchess, and having an interesting quarrel with
      her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quarrel with her?&rdquo; repeated Deronda, rather uncomfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, about theology, of course; nothing personal. But she told you
      what you ought to think, and then left you with a grand air which was
      admirable. Is she an Antinomian&mdash;if so, tell her I am an Antinomian
      painter, and introduce me. I should like to paint her and her husband. He
      has the sort of handsome <i>physique</i> that the Duke ought to have in <i>Lucrezia
      Borgia</i>&mdash;if it could go with a fine baritone, which it can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda devoutly hoped that Hans&rsquo;s account of the impression his
      dialogue with Gwendolen had made on a distant beholder was no more than a
      bit of fantastic representation, such as was common with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gwendolen was not without her after-thoughts that her husband&rsquo;s
      eyes might have been on her, extracting something to reprove&mdash;some
      offence against her dignity as his wife; her consciousness telling her
      that she had not kept up the perfect air of equability in public which was
      her own ideal. But Grandcourt made no observation on her behavior. All he
      said as they were driving home was,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lush will dine with us among the other people to-morrow. You will
      treat him civilly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s heart began to beat violently. The words that she wanted
      to utter, as one wants to return a blow, were. &ldquo;You are breaking
      your promise to me&mdash;the first promise you made me.&rdquo; But she
      dared not utter them. She was as frightened at a quarrel as if she had
      foreseen that it would end with throttling fingers on her neck. After a
      pause, she said in the tone rather of defeat than resentment,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you did not intend him to frequent the house again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want him just now. He is useful to me; and he must be treated
      civilly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence. There may come a moment when even an excellent husband who has
      dropped smoking under more or less of a pledge during courtship, for the
      first time will introduce his cigar-smoke between himself and his wife,
      with the tacit understanding that she will have to put up with it. Mr.
      Lush was, so to speak, a very large cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      If these are the sort of lovers&rsquo; vows at which Jove laughs, he must
      have a merry time of it.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;If any one should importune me to give a reason why I loved him, I
    feel it could no otherwise be expressed than by making answer,
    &lsquo;Because it was he, because it was I.&rsquo; There is, beyond what I am able
    to say, I know not what inexplicable power that brought on this

</pre>
    <p>
      The time had come to prepare Mordecai for the revelation of the restored
      sister and for the change of abode which was desirable before Mirah&rsquo;s
      meeting with her brother. Mrs. Meyrick, to whom Deronda had confided
      everything except Mordecai&rsquo;s peculiar relation to himself, had been
      active in helping him to find a suitable lodging in Brompton, not many
      minutes&rsquo; walk from her own house, so that the brother and sister
      would be within reach of her motherly care. Her happy mixture of Scottish
      fervor and Gaelic liveliness had enabled her to keep the secret close from
      the girls as well as from Hans, any betrayal to them being likely to reach
      Mirah in some way that would raise an agitating suspicion, and spoil the
      important opening of that work which was to secure her independence, as we
      rather arbitrarily call one of the more arduous and dignified forms of our
      dependence. And both Mrs. Meyrick and Deronda had more reasons than they
      could have expressed for desiring that Mirah should be able to maintain
      herself. Perhaps &ldquo;the little mother&rdquo; was rather helped in her
      secrecy by some dubiousness in her sentiment about the remarkable brother
      described to her; and certainly if she felt any joy and anticipatory
      admiration, it was due to her faith in Deronda&rsquo;s judgment. The
      consumption was a sorrowful fact that appealed to her tenderness; but how
      was she to be very glad of an enthusiasm which, to tell the truth, she
      could only contemplate as Jewish pertinacity, and as rather an undesirable
      introduction among them all of a man whose conversation would not be more
      modern and encouraging than that of Scott&rsquo;s Covenanters? Her mind
      was anything but prosaic, and had her soberer share of Mab&rsquo;s delight
      in the romance of Mirah&rsquo;s story and of her abode with them; but the
      romantic or unusual in real life requires some adaptation. We sit up at
      night to read about Sakya-Mouni, St. Francis, or Oliver Cromwell; but
      whether we should be glad for any one at all like them to call on us the
      next morning, still more, to reveal himself as a new relation, is quite
      another affair. Besides, Mrs. Meyrick had hoped, as her children did, that
      the intensity of Mirah&rsquo;s feeling about Judaism would slowly subside,
      and be merged in the gradually deepening current of loving interchange
      with her new friends. In fact, her secret favorite continuation of the
      romance had been no discovery of Jewish relations, but something much more
      favorable to the hopes she discerned in Hans. And now&mdash;here was a
      brother who would dip Mirah&rsquo;s mind over again in the deepest dye of
      Jewish sentiment. She could not help saying to Deronda,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am as glad as you are that the pawnbroker is not her brother:
      there are Ezras and Ezras in the world; and really it is a comfort to
      think that all Jews are not like those shopkeepers who <i>will not</i> let
      you get out of their shops: and besides, what he said to you about his
      mother and sister makes me bless him. I am sure he&rsquo;s good. But I
      never did like anything fanatical. I suppose I heard a little too much
      preaching in my youth and lost my palate for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will find that Mordecai obtrudes any
      preaching,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;He is not what I should call
      fanatical. I call a man fanatical when his enthusiasm is narrow and
      hoodwinked, so that he has no sense of proportions, and becomes unjust and
      unsympathetic to men who are out of his own track. Mordecai is an
      enthusiast; I should like to keep that word for the highest order of minds&mdash;those
      who care supremely for grand and general benefits to mankind. He is not a
      strictly orthodox Jew, and is full of allowances for others; his
      conformity in many things is an allowance for the condition of other Jews.
      The people he lives with are as fond of him as possible, and they can&rsquo;t
      in the least understand his ideas.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I can live up to the level of the pawnbroker&rsquo;s
      mother, and like him for what I see to be good in him; and for what I don&rsquo;t
      see the merits of I will take your word. According to your definition, I
      suppose one might be fanatical in worshipping common-sense; for my poor
      husband used to say the world would be a poor place if there were nothing
      but common-sense in it. However, Mirah&rsquo;s brother will have good
      bedding&mdash;that I have taken care of; and I shall have this extra
      window pasted up with paper to prevent draughts.&rdquo; (The conversation
      was taking place in the destined lodging.) &ldquo;It is a comfort to think
      that the people of the house are no strangers to me&mdash;no hypocritical
      harpies. And when the children know, we shall be able to make the rooms
      much prettier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next stage of the affair is to tell all to Mordecai, and get
      him to move&mdash;which may be a more difficult business,&rdquo; said
      Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you tell Mirah before I say anything to the children?&rdquo;
      said Mrs. Meyrick. But Deronda hesitated, and she went on in a tone of
      persuasive deliberation&mdash;&ldquo;No, I think not. Let me tell Hans and
      the girls the evening before, and they will be away the next morning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that will be best. But do justice to my account of Mordecai&mdash;or
      Ezra, as I suppose Mirah will wish to call him: don&rsquo;t assist their
      imagination by referring to Habakkuk Mucklewrath,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      smiling&mdash;Mrs. Meyrick herself having used the comparison of the
      Covenanters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me, trust me,&rdquo; said the little mother. &ldquo;I shall
      have to persuade them so hard to be glad, that I shall convert myself.
      When I am frightened I find it a good thing to have somebody to be angry
      with for not being brave: it warms the blood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda might have been more argumentative or persuasive about the view to
      be taken of Mirah&rsquo;s brother, if he had been less anxiously
      preoccupied with the more important task immediately before him, which he
      desired to acquit himself of without wounding the Cohens. Mordecai, by a
      memorable answer, had made it evident that he would be keenly alive to any
      inadvertance in relation to their feelings. In the interval, he had been
      meeting Mordecai at the <i>Hand and Banner</i>, but now after due
      reflection he wrote to him saying that he had particular reasons for
      wishing to see him in his own home the next evening, and would beg to sit
      with him in his workroom for an hour, if the Cohens would not regard it as
      an intrusion. He would call with the understanding that if there were any
      objection, Mordecai would accompany him elsewhere. Deronda hoped in this
      way to create a little expectation that would have a preparatory effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was received with the usual friendliness, some additional costume in
      the women and children, and in all the elders a slight air of wondering
      which even in Cohen was not allowed to pass the bounds of silence&mdash;the
      guest&rsquo;s transactions with Mordecai being a sort of mystery which he
      was rather proud to think lay outside the sphere of light which enclosed
      his own understanding. But when Deronda said, &ldquo;I suppose Mordecai is
      at home and expecting me,&rdquo; Jacob, who had profited by the family
      remarks, went up to his knee and said, &ldquo;What do you want to talk to
      Mordecai about?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something that is very interesting to him,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      pinching the lad&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;but that you can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you say this?&rdquo; said Jacob, immediately giving forth a
      string of his rote-learned Hebrew verses with a wonderful mixture of the
      throaty and the nasal, and nodding his small head at his hearer, with a
      sense of giving formidable evidence which might rather alter their mutual
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really,&rdquo; said Deronda, keeping grave; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      say anything like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought not,&rdquo; said Jacob, performing a dance of triumph
      with his small scarlet legs, while he took various objects out of the deep
      pockets of his knickerbockers and returned them thither, as a slight hint
      of his resources; after which, running to the door of the workroom, he
      opened it wide, set his back against it, and said, &ldquo;Mordecai, here&rsquo;s
      the young swell&rdquo;&mdash;a copying of his father&rsquo;s phrase, which
      seemed to him well fitted to cap the recitation of Hebrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was called back with hushes by mother and grandmother, and Deronda,
      entering and closing the door behind him, saw that a bit of carpet had
      been laid down, a chair placed, and the fire and lights attended to, in
      sign of the Cohens&rsquo; respect. As Mordecai rose to greet him, Deronda
      was struck with the air of solemn expectation in his face, such as would
      have seemed perfectly natural if his letter had declared that some
      revelation was to be made about the lost sister. Neither of them spoke,
      till Deronda, with his usual tenderness of manner, had drawn the vacant
      chair from the opposite side of the hearth and had seated himself near to
      Mordecai, who then said, in a tone of fervid certainty,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are coming to tell me something that my soul longs for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true I have something very weighty to tell you&mdash;something
      I trust that you will rejoice in,&rdquo; said Deronda, on his guard
      against the probability that Mordecai had been preparing himself for
      something quite different from the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all revealed&mdash;it is made clear to you,&rdquo; said
      Mordecai, more eagerly, leaning forward with clasped hands. &ldquo;You are
      even as my brother that sucked the breasts of my mother&mdash;the heritage
      is yours&mdash;there is no doubt to divide us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have learned nothing new about myself,&rdquo; said Deronda. The
      disappointment was inevitable: it was better not to let the feeling be
      strained longer in a mistaken hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai sank back in his chair, unable for the moment to care what was
      really coming. The whole day his mind had been in a state of tension
      toward one fulfillment. The reaction was sickening and he closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except,&rdquo; Deronda went on gently, after a pause,&mdash;&ldquo;except
      that I had really some time ago come into another sort of hidden
      connection with you, besides what you have spoken of as existing in your
      own feeling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes were not opened, but there was a fluttering in the lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had made the acquaintance of one in whom you are interested.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One who is closely related to your departed mother,&rdquo; Deronda
      went on wishing to make the disclosure gradual; but noticing a shrinking
      movement in Mordecai, he added&mdash;&ldquo;whom she and you held dear
      above all others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai, with a sudden start, laid a spasmodic grasp on Deronda&rsquo;s
      wrist; there was a great terror in him. And Deronda divined it. A tremor
      was perceptible in his clear tones as he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was prayed for has come to pass: Mirah has been delivered from
      evil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai&rsquo;s grasp relaxed a little, but he was panting with a
      tearless sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda went on: &ldquo;Your sister is worthy of the mother you honored.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited there, and Mordecai, throwing himself backward in his chair,
      again closed his eyes, uttering himself almost inaudibly for some minutes
      in Hebrew, and then subsiding into a happy-looking silence. Deronda,
      watching the expression in his uplifted face, could have imagined that he
      was speaking with some beloved object: there was a new suffused sweetness,
      something like that on the faces of the beautiful dead. For the first time
      Deronda thought he discerned a family resemblance to Mirah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently when Mordecai was ready to listen, the rest was told. But in
      accounting for Mirah&rsquo;s flight he made the statement about the father&rsquo;s
      conduct as vague as he could, and threw the emphasis on her yearning to
      come to England as the place where she might find her mother. Also he kept
      back the fact of Mirah&rsquo;s intention to drown herself, and his own
      part in rescuing her; merely describing the home she had found with
      friends of his, whose interest in her and efforts for her he had shared.
      What he dwelt on finally was Mirah&rsquo;s feeling about her mother and
      brother; and in relation to this he tried to give every detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in search of them,&rdquo; said Deronda, smiling, &ldquo;that
      I turned into this house: the name Ezra Cohen was just then the most
      interesting name in the world to me. I confess I had fear for a long
      while. Perhaps you will forgive me now for having asked you that question
      about the elder Mrs. Cohen&rsquo;s daughter. I cared very much what I
      should find Mirah&rsquo;s friends to be. But I had found a brother worthy
      of her when I knew that her Ezra was disguised under the name of Mordecai.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mordecai is really my name&mdash;Ezra Mordecai Cohen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any kinship between this family and yours?&rdquo; said
      Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the kinship of Israel. My soul clings to these people, who
      have sheltered me and given me succor out of the affection that abides in
      Jewish hearts, as sweet odor in things long crushed and hidden from the
      outer air. It is good for me to bear with their ignorance and be bound to
      them in gratitude, that I may keep in mind the spiritual poverty of the
      Jewish million, and not put impatient knowledge in the stead of loving
      wisdom.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t feel bound to continue with them now there is a
      closer tie to draw you?&rdquo; said Deronda, not without fear that he
      might find an obstacle to overcome. &ldquo;It seems to me right now&mdash;is
      it not?&mdash;that you should live with your sister; and I have prepared a
      home to take you to in the neighborhood of her friends, that she may join
      you there. Pray grant me this wish. It will enable me to be with you often
      in the hours when Mirah is obliged to leave you. That is my selfish
      reason. But the chief reason is, that Mirah will desire to watch over you,
      and that you ought to give her the guardianship of a brother&rsquo;s
      presence. You shall have books about you. I shall want to learn of you,
      and to take you out to see the river and trees. And you will have the rest
      and comfort that you will be more and more in need of&mdash;nay, that I
      need for you. This is the claim I make on you, now that we have found each
      other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda spoke in a tone of earnest, affectionate pleading, such as he
      might have used to a venerated elder brother. Mordecai&rsquo;s eyes were
      fixed on him with a listening contemplation, and he was silent for a
      little while after Deronda had ceased to speak. Then he said, with an
      almost reproachful emphasis,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would have me hold it doubtful whether you were born a Jew!
      Have we not from the first touched each other with invisible fibres&mdash;have
      we not quivered together like the leaves from a common stem with stirring
      from a common root? I know what I am outwardly, I am one among the crowd
      of poor&mdash;I am stricken, I am dying. But our souls know each other.
      They gazed in silence as those who have long been parted and meet again,
      but when they found voice they were assured, and all their speech is
      understanding. The life of Israel is in your veins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda sat perfectly still, but felt his face tingling. It was impossible
      either to deny or assent. He waited, hoping that Mordecai would presently
      give him a more direct answer. And after a pause of meditation he did say,
      firmly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you wish of me I will do. And our mother&mdash;may the
      blessing of the Eternal be with her in our souls!&mdash;would have wished
      it too. I will accept what your loving kindness has prepared, and Mirah&rsquo;s
      home shall be mine.&rdquo; He paused a moment, and then added in a more
      melancholy tone, &ldquo;But I shall grieve to part from these parents and
      the little ones. You must tell them, for my heart would fail me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt that you would want me to tell them. Shall we go now at
      once?&rdquo; said Deronda, much relieved by this unwavering compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; let us not defer it. It must be done,&rdquo; said Mordecai,
      rising with the air of a man who has to perform a painful duty. Then came,
      as an afterthought, &ldquo;But do not dwell on my sister more than is
      needful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When they entered the parlor he said to the alert Jacob, &ldquo;Ask your
      father to come, and tell Sarah to mind the shop. My friend has something
      to say,&rdquo; he continued, turning to the elder Mrs. Cohen. It seemed
      part of Mordecai&rsquo;s eccentricity that he should call this gentleman
      his friend; and the two women tried to show their better manners by warm
      politeness in begging Deronda to seat himself in the best place.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cohen entered with a pen behind his ear, he rubbed his hands and said
      with loud satisfaction, &ldquo;Well, sir! I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re
      doing us the honor to join our family party again. We are pretty
      comfortable, I think.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked round with shiny gladness. And when all were seated on the
      hearth the scene was worth peeping in upon: on one side Baby under her
      scarlet quilt in the corner being rocked by the young mother, and Adelaide
      Rebekah seated on the grandmother&rsquo;s knee; on the other, Jacob
      between his father&rsquo;s legs; while the two markedly different figures
      of Deronda and Mordecai were in the middle&mdash;Mordecai a little
      backward in the shade, anxious to conceal his agitated susceptibility to
      what was going on around him. The chief light came from the fire, which
      brought out the rich color on a depth of shadow, and seemed to turn into
      speech the dark gems of eyes that looked at each other kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just been telling Mordecai of an event that makes a great
      change in his life,&rdquo; Deronda began, &ldquo;but I hope you will agree
      with me that it is a joyful one. Since he thinks of you as his best
      friends, he wishes me to tell you for him at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Relations with money, sir?&rdquo; burst in Cohen, feeling a power
      of divination which it was a pity to nullify by waiting for the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not exactly,&rdquo; said Deronda, smiling. &ldquo;But a very
      precious relation wishes to be reunited to him&mdash;a very good and
      lovely young sister, who will care for his comfort in every way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But with a maintenance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With talents which will secure her a maintenance. A home is already
      provided for Mordecai.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a moment or two before the grandmother said in a
      wailing tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! and so you&rsquo;re going away from us, Mordecai.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where there&rsquo;s no children as there is here,&rdquo; said
      the mother, catching the wail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No Jacob, and no Adelaide, and no Eugenie!&rdquo; wailed the
      grandmother again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, Jacob&rsquo;s learning &lsquo;ill all wear out of him. He
      must go to school. It&rsquo;ll be hard times for Jacob,&rdquo; said Cohen,
      in a tone of decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the wide-open ears of Jacob his father&rsquo;s words sounded like a
      doom, giving an awful finish to the dirge-like effect of the whole
      announcement. His face had been gathering a wondering incredulous sorrow
      at the notion of Mordecai&rsquo;s going away: he was unable to imagine the
      change as anything lasting; but at the mention of &ldquo;hard times for
      Jacob&rdquo; there was no further suspense of feeling, and he broke forth
      in loud lamentation. Adelaide Rebekah always cried when her brother cried,
      and now began to howl with astonishing suddenness, whereupon baby awaking
      contributed angry screams, and required to be taken out of the cradle. A
      great deal of hushing was necessary, and Mordecai feeling the cries pierce
      him, put out his arms to Jacob, who in the midst of his tears and sobs was
      turning his head right and left for general observation. His father, who
      had been saying, &ldquo;Never mind, old man; you shall go to the riders,&rdquo;
      now released him, and he went to Mordecai, who clasped him, and laid his
      cheek on the little black head without speaking. But Cohen, sensible that
      the master of the family must make some apology for all this weakness, and
      that the occasion called for a speech, addressed Deronda with some
      elevation of pitch, squaring his elbows and resting a hand on each knee:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as we&rsquo;re the people to grudge anybody&rsquo;s
      good luck, sir, or the portion of their cup being made fuller, as I may
      say. I&rsquo;m not an envious man, and if anybody offered to set up
      Mordecai in a shop of my sort two doors lower down, <i>I</i> shouldn&rsquo;t
      make wry faces about it. I&rsquo;m not one of them that had need have a
      poor opinion of themselves, and be frightened at anybody else getting a
      chance. If I&rsquo;m offal, let a wise man come and tell me, for I&rsquo;ve
      never heard it yet. And in point of business, I&rsquo;m not a class of
      goods to be in danger. If anybody takes to rolling me, I can pack myself
      up like a caterpillar, and find my feet when I&rsquo;m let alone. And
      though, as I may say, you&rsquo;re taking some of our good works from us,
      which is property bearing interest, I&rsquo;m not saying but we can afford
      that, though my mother and my wife had the good will to wish and do for
      Mordecai to the last; and a Jew must not be like a servant who works for
      reward&mdash;though I see nothing against a reward if I can get it. And as
      to the extra outlay in schooling, I&rsquo;m neither poor nor greedy&mdash;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t hang myself for sixpence, nor half a crown neither. But the
      truth of it is, the women and children are fond of Mordecai. You may
      partly see how it is, sir, by your own sense. A Jewish man is bound to
      thank God, day by day, that he was not made a woman; but a woman has to
      thank God that He has made her according to His will. And we all know what
      He has made her&mdash;a child-bearing, tender-hearted thing is the woman
      of our people. Her children are mostly stout, as I think you&rsquo;ll say
      Addy&rsquo;s are, and she&rsquo;s not mushy, but her heart is tender. So
      you must excuse present company, sir, for not being glad all at once. And
      as to this young lady&mdash;for by what you say &lsquo;young lady&rsquo;
      is the proper term&rdquo;&mdash;Cohen here threw some additional emphasis
      into his look and tone&mdash;&ldquo;we shall all be glad for Mordecai&rsquo;s
      sake by-and-by, when we cast up our accounts and see where we are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Deronda could summon any answer to this oddly mixed speech,
      Mordecai exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends, friends! For food and raiment and shelter I would not have
      sought better than you have given me. You have sweetened the morsel with
      love; and what I thought of as a joy that would be left to me even in the
      last months of my waning strength was to go on teaching the lad. But now I
      am as one who had clad himself beforehand in his shroud, and used himself
      to making the grave his bed, when the divine command sounded in his ears,
      &lsquo;Arise, and go forth; the night is not yet come.&rsquo; For no light
      matter would I have turned away from your kindness to take another&rsquo;s.
      But it has been taught us, as you know, that <i>the reward of one duty is
      the power to fulfill another</i>&mdash;so said Ben Azai. You have made
      your duty to one of the poor among your brethren a joy to you and me; and
      your reward shall be that you will not rest without the joy of like deeds
      in the time to come. And may not Jacob come and visit me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai had turned with this question to Deronda, who said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely that can be managed. It is no further than Brompton.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob, who had been gradually calmed by the need to hear what was going
      forward, began now to see some daylight on the future, the word &ldquo;visit&rdquo;
      having the lively charm of cakes and general relaxation at his grandfather&rsquo;s,
      the dealer in knives. He danced away from Mordecai, and took up a station
      of survey in the middle of the hearth with his hands in his
      knickerbockers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the grandmother, with a sigh of resignation,
      &ldquo;I hope there&rsquo;ll be nothing in the way of your getting <i>kosher</i>
      meat, Mordecai. For you&rsquo;ll have to trust to those you live with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, that&rsquo;s all right, you may be sure,
      mother,&rdquo; said Cohen, as if anxious to cut off inquiry on matters in
      which he was uncertain of the guest&rsquo;s position. &ldquo;So, sir,&rdquo;
      he added, turning with a look of amused enlightenment to Deronda, &ldquo;it
      was better than learning you had to talk to Mordecai about! I wondered to
      myself at the time. I thought somehow there was a something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mordecai will perhaps explain to you how it was that I was seeking
      him,&rdquo; said Deronda, feeling that he had better go, and rising as he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was agreed that he should come again and the final move be made on the
      next day but one; but when he was going Mordecai begged to walk with him
      to the end of the street, and wrapped himself in coat and comforter. It
      was a March evening, and Deronda did not mean to let him go far, but he
      understood the wish to be outside the house with him in communicative
      silence, after the exciting speech that had been filling the last hour. No
      word was spoken until Deronda had proposed parting, when he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mirah would wish to thank the Cohens for their goodness. You would
      wish her to do so&mdash;to come and see them, would you not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai did not answer immediately, but at length said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell. I fear not. There is a family sorrow, and the sight
      of my sister might be to them as the fresh bleeding of wounds. There is a
      daughter and sister who will never be restored as Mirah is. But who knows
      the pathways? We are all of us denying or fulfilling prayers&mdash;and men
      in their careless deeds walk amidst invisible outstretched arms and
      pleadings made in vain. In my ears I have the prayers of generations past
      and to come. My life is as nothing to me but the beginning of fulfilment.
      And yet I am only another prayer&mdash;which you will fulfil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda pressed his hand, and they parted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And you must love him ere to you
  He will seem worthy of your love.&rdquo;
                         &mdash;WORDSWORTH.
</pre>
    <p>
      One might be tempted to envy Deronda providing new clothes for Mordecai,
      and pleasing himself as if he were sketching a picture in imagining the
      effect of the fine gray flannel shirts and a dressing-gown very much like
      a Franciscan&rsquo;s brown frock, with Mordecai&rsquo;s head and neck
      above them. Half his pleasure was the sense of seeing Mirah&rsquo;s
      brother through her eyes, and securing her fervid joy from any perturbing
      impression. And yet, after he had made all things ready, he was visited
      with doubt whether he were not mistaking her, and putting the lower effect
      for the higher: was she not just as capable as he himself had been of
      feeling the impressive distinction in her brother all the more for that
      aspect of poverty which was among the memorials of his past? But there
      were the Meyricks to be propitiated toward this too Judaic brother; and
      Deronda detected himself piqued into getting out of sight everything that
      might feed the ready repugnance in minds unblessed with that precious
      &ldquo;seeing,&rdquo; that bathing of all objects in a solemnity as of
      sun-set glow, which is begotten of a loving reverential emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his inclination would have been the more confirmed if he had heard the
      dialogue round Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s fire late in the evening, after Mirah
      had gone to her room. Hans, settled now in his Chelsea rooms, had stayed
      late, and Mrs. Meyrick, poking the fire into a blaze, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Kate, put out your candle, and all come round the fire cosily.
      Hans, dear, do leave off laughing at those poems for the ninety-ninth
      time, and come too. I have something wonderful to tell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I didn&rsquo;t know that, ma. I have seen it in the corner of
      your eye ever so long, and in your pretense of errands,&rdquo; said Kate,
      while the girls came up to put their feet on the fender, and Hans, pushing
      his chair near them, sat astride it, resting his fists and chin on the
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, if you are so wise, perhaps you know that Mirah&rsquo;s
      brother is found!&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick, in her clearest accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, confound it!&rdquo; said Hans, in the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hans, that is wicked,&rdquo; said Mab. &ldquo;Suppose we had lost
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>cannot</i> help being rather sorry,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;And
      her mother?&mdash;where is she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her mother is dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the brother is not a bad man,&rdquo; said Amy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor a fellow all smiles and jewelry&mdash;a Crystal Palace Assyrian
      with a hat on,&rdquo; said Hans, in the worst humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were there ever such unfeeling children?&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick,
      a little strengthened by the need for opposition. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      think the least bit of Mirah&rsquo;s joy in the matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, ma, Mirah hardly remembers her brother,&rdquo; said Kate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People who are lost for twelve years should never come back again,&rdquo;
      said Hans. &ldquo;They are always in the way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hans!&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick, reproachfully. &ldquo;If you had
      lost me for <i>twenty</i> years, I should have thought&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said twelve years,&rdquo; Hans broke in. &ldquo;Anywhere about
      twelve years is the time at which lost relations should keep out of the
      way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but it&rsquo;s nice finding people&mdash;there is something
      to tell,&rdquo; said Mab, clasping her knees. &ldquo;Did Prince
      Camaralzaman find him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Meyrick, in her neat, narrative way, told all she knew without
      interruption. &ldquo;Mr. Deronda has the highest admiration for him,&rdquo;
      she ended&mdash;&ldquo;seems quite to look up to him. And he says Mirah is
      just the sister to understand this brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deronda is getting perfectly preposterous about those Jews,&rdquo;
      said Hans with disgust, rising and setting his chair away with a bang.
      &ldquo;He wants to do everything he can to encourage Mirah in her
      prejudices.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for shame, Hans!&mdash;to speak in that way of Mr. Deronda,&rdquo;
      said Mab. And Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s face showed something like an
      under-current of expression not allowed to get to the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now we shall never be all together,&rdquo; Hans went on,
      walking about with his hands thrust into the pockets of his brown
      velveteen coat, &ldquo;but we must have this prophet Elijah to tea with
      us, and Mirah will think of nothing but sitting on the ruins of Jerusalem.
      She will be spoiled as an artist&mdash;mind that&mdash;she will get as
      narrow as a nun. Everything will be spoiled&mdash;our home and everything.
      I shall take to drinking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, really, Hans,&rdquo; said Kate, impatiently. &ldquo;I do think
      men are the most contemptible animals in all creation. Every one of them
      must have everything to his mind, else he is unbearable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh, it&rsquo;s very dreadful!&rdquo; cried Mab. &ldquo;I
      feel as if ancient Nineveh were come again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to know what is the good of having gone to the
      university and knowing everything, if you are so childish, Hans,&rdquo;
      said Amy. &ldquo;You ought to put up with a man that Providence sends you
      to be kind to. <i>We</i> shall have to put up with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will all of you like the new Lamentations of Jeremiah&mdash;&lsquo;to
      be continued in our next&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Hans,
      seizing his wide-awake. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use being one thing more than
      another if one has to endure the company of those men with a fixed idea,
      staring blankly at you, and requiring all your remarks to be small
      foot-notes to their text. If you&rsquo;re to be under a petrifying wall,
      you&rsquo;d better be an old boot. I don&rsquo;t feel myself an old boot.&rdquo;
      Then abruptly, &ldquo;Good night, little mother,&rdquo; bending to kiss
      her brow in a hasty, desperate manner, and condescendingly, on his way to
      the door, &ldquo;Good-night, girls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose Mirah knew how you are behaving,&rdquo; said Kate. But her
      answer was a slam of the door. &ldquo;I <i>should</i> like to see Mirah
      when Mr. Deronda tells her,&rdquo; she went on to her mother. &ldquo;I
      know she will look so beautiful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Deronda, on second thoughts, had written a letter, which Mrs. Meyrick
      received the next morning, begging her to make the revelation instead of
      waiting for him, not giving the real reason&mdash;that he shrank from
      going again through a narrative in which he seemed to be making himself
      important and giving himself a character of general beneficence&mdash;but
      saying that he wished to remain with Mordecai while Mrs. Meyrick would
      bring Mirah on what was to be understood as a visit, so that there might
      be a little interval before that change of abode which he expected that
      Mirah herself would propose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda secretly felt some wondering anxiety how far Mordecai, after years
      of solitary preoccupation with ideas likely to have become the more
      exclusive from continual diminution of bodily strength, would allow him to
      feel a tender interest in his sister over and above the rendering of pious
      duties. His feeling for the Cohens, and especially for little Jacob,
      showed a persistent activity of affection; but these objects had entered
      into his daily life for years; and Deronda felt it noticeable that
      Mordecai asked no new questions about Mirah, maintaining, indeed, an
      unusual silence on all subjects, and appearing simply to submit to the
      changes that were coming over his personal life. He donned the new clothes
      obediently, but said afterward to Deronda, with a faint smile, &ldquo;I
      must keep my old garments by me for a remembrance.&rdquo; And when they
      were seated, awaiting Mirah, he uttered no word, keeping his eyelids
      closed, but yet showing restless feeling in his face and hands. In fact,
      Mordecai was undergoing that peculiar nervous perturbation only known to
      those whose minds, long and habitually moving with strong impetus in one
      current, are suddenly compelled into a new or reopened channel.
      Susceptible people, whose strength has been long absorbed by dormant bias,
      dread an interview that imperiously revives the past, as they would dread
      a threatening illness. Joy may be there, but joy, too, is terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda felt the infection of excitement, and when he heard the ring at
      the door, he went out, not knowing exactly why, that he might see and
      greet Mirah beforehand. He was startled to find that she had on the hat
      and cloak in which he had first seen her&mdash;the memorable cloak that
      had once been wetted for a winding-sheet. She had come down-stairs
      equipped in this way; and when Mrs. Meyrick said, in a tone of question,
      &ldquo;You like to go in that dress, dear?&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;My
      brother is poor, and I want to look as much like him as I can, else he may
      feel distant from me&rdquo;&mdash;imagining that she should meet him in
      the workman&rsquo;s dress. Deronda could not make any remark, but felt
      secretly rather ashamed of his own fastidious arrangements. They shook
      hands silently, for Mirah looked pale and awed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Deronda opened the door for her, Mordecai had risen, and had his eyes
      turned toward it with an eager gaze. Mirah took only two or three steps,
      and then stood still. They looked at each other, motionless. It was less
      their own presence that they felt than another&rsquo;s; they were meeting
      first in memories, compared with which touch was no union. Mirah was the
      first to break the silence, standing where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ezra,&rdquo; she said, in exactly the same tone as when she was
      telling of her mother&rsquo;s call to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai with a sudden movement advanced and laid his hand on her
      shoulders. He was the head taller, and looked down at her tenderly while
      he said, &ldquo;That was our mother&rsquo;s voice. You remember her
      calling me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and how you answered her&mdash;&lsquo;Mother!&rsquo;&mdash;and
      I knew you loved her.&rdquo; Mirah threw her arms round her brother&rsquo;s
      neck, clasped her little hands behind it, and drew down his face, kissing
      it with childlike lavishness. Her hat fell backward on the ground and
      disclosed all her curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the dear head, the dear head!&rdquo; said Mordecai, in a low
      loving tone, laying his thin hand gently on the curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very ill, Ezra,&rdquo; said Mirah, sadly looking at him
      with more observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear child, I shall not be long with you in the body,&rdquo;
      was the quiet answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I will love you and we will talk to each other,&rdquo; said
      Mirah, with a sweet outpouring of her words, as spontaneous as bird-notes.
      &ldquo;I will tell you everything, and you will teach me:&mdash;you will
      teach me to be a good Jewess&mdash;what she would have liked me to be. I
      shall always be with you when I am not working. For I work now. I shall
      get money to keep us. Oh, I have had such good friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah until now had quite forgotten that any one was by, but here she
      turned with the prettiest attitude, keeping one hand on her brother&rsquo;s
      arm while she looked at Mrs. Meyrick and Deronda. The little mother&rsquo;s
      happy emotion in witnessing this meeting of brother and sister had already
      won her to Mordecai, who seemed to her really to have more dignity and
      refinement than she had felt obliged to believe in from Deronda&rsquo;s
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See this dear lady!&rdquo; said Mirah. &ldquo;I was a stranger, a
      poor wanderer, and she believed in me, and has treated me as a daughter.
      Please give my brother your hand,&rdquo; she added, beseechingly, taking
      Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s hand and putting it in Mordecai&rsquo;s, then
      pressing them both with her own and lifting them to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Eternal Goodness has been with you,&rdquo; said Mordecai.
      &ldquo;You have helped to fulfill our mother&rsquo;s prayer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we will go now, shall we?&mdash;and return later,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, laying a gentle pressure on Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s arm, and
      she immediately complied. He was afraid of any reference to the facts
      about himself which he had kept back from Mordecai, and he felt no
      uneasiness now in the thought of the brother and sister being alone
      together.

      CHAPTER XLVIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &lsquo;Tis hard and ill-paid task to order all things beforehand by the rule
    of our own security, as is well hinted by Machiavelli concerning
    Caesar Borgia, who, saith he, had thought of all that might occur on
    his father&rsquo;s death, and had provided against every evil chance save
    only one: it had never come into his mind that when his father died,
    his own death would quickly follow.

    <p>
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s importance as a subject of this realm was of the
      grandly passive kind which consists in the inheritance of land. Political
      and social movements touched him only through the wire of his rental, and
      his most careful biographer need not have read up on Schleswig-Holstein,
      the policy of Bismarck, trade-unions, household suffrage, or even the last
      commercial panic. He glanced over the best newspaper columns on these
      topics, and his views on them can hardly be said to have wanted breadth,
      since he embraced all Germans, all commercial men, and all voters liable
      to use the wrong kind of soap, under the general epithet of &ldquo;brutes;&rdquo;
      but he took no action on these much-agitated questions beyond looking from
      under his eyelids at any man who mentioned them, and retaining a silence
      which served to shake the opinions of timid thinkers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Grandcourt, within his own sphere of interest, showed some of the
      qualities which have entered into triumphal diplomacy of the wildest
      continental sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      No movement of Gwendolen in relation to Deronda escaped him. He would have
      denied that he was jealous; because jealousy would have implied some doubt
      of his own power to hinder what he had determined against. That his wife
      should have more inclination to another man&rsquo;s society than to his
      own would not pain him: what he required was that she should be as fully
      aware as she would have been of a locked hand-cuff, that her inclination
      was helpless to decide anything in contradiction with his resolve. However
      much of vacillating whim there might have been in his entrance on
      matrimony, there was no vacillating in his interpretation of the bond. He
      had not repented of his marriage; it had really brought more of aim into
      his life, new objects to exert his will upon; and he had not repented of
      his choice. His taste was fastidious, and Gwendolen satisfied it: he would
      not have liked a wife who had not received some elevation of rank from
      him; nor one who did not command admiration by her mien and beauty; nor
      one whose nails were not of the right shape; nor one the lobe of whose ear
      was at all too large and red; nor one who, even if her nails and ears were
      right, was at the same time a ninny, unable to make spirited answers.
      These requirements may not seem too exacting to refined contemporaries
      whose own ability to fall in love has been held in suspense for lack of
      indispensable details; but fewer perhaps may follow him in his contentment
      that his wife should be in a temper which would dispose her to fly out if
      she dared, and that she should have been urged into marrying him by other
      feelings than passionate attachment. Still, for those who prefer command
      to love, one does not see why the habit of mind should change precisely at
      the point of matrimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt did not feel that he had chosen the wrong wife; and having
      taken on himself the part of husband, he was not going in any way to be
      fooled, or allow himself to be seen in a light that could be regarded as
      pitiable. This was his state of mind&mdash;not jealousy; still, his
      behavior in some respects was as like jealousy as yellow is to yellow,
      which color we know may be the effect of very different causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come up to town earlier than usual because he wished to be on the
      spot for legal consultation as to the arrangements of his will, the
      transference of mortgages, and that transaction with his uncle about the
      succession to Diplow, which the bait of ready money, adroitly dangled
      without importunity, had finally won him to agree upon. But another
      acceptable accompaniment of his being in town was the presentation of
      himself with the beautiful bride whom he had chosen to marry in spite of
      what other people might have expected of him. It is true that Grandcourt
      went about with the sense that he did not care a languid curse for any one&rsquo;s
      admiration: but this state of not-caring, just as much as desire, required
      its related object&mdash;namely, a world of admiring or envying
      spectators: for if you are fond of looking stonily at smiling persons&mdash;the
      persons must be and they must smile&mdash;a rudimentary truth which is
      surely forgotten by those who complain of mankind as generally
      contemptible, since any other aspect of the race must disappoint the
      voracity of their contempt. Grandcourt, in town for the first time with
      his wife, had his non-caring abstinence from curses enlarged and
      diversified by splendid receptions, by conspicuous rides and drives, by
      presentations of himself with her on all distinguished occasions. He
      wished her to be sought after; he liked that &ldquo;fellows&rdquo; should
      be eager to talk with her and escort her within his observation; there was
      even a kind of lofty coquetry on her part that he would not have objected
      to. But what he did not like were her ways in relation to Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the musical party at Lady Mallinger&rsquo;s, when Grandcourt had
      observed the dialogue on the settee as keenly as Hans had done, it was
      characteristic of him that he named Deronda for invitation along with the
      Mallingers, tenaciously avoiding the possible suggestion to anybody
      concerned that Deronda&rsquo;s presence or absence could be of the least
      importance to him; and he made no direct observation to Gwendolen on her
      behavior that evening, lest the expression of his disgust should be a
      little too strong to satisfy his own pride. But a few days afterward he
      remarked, without being careful of the <i>à propos</i>,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing makes a woman more of a gawky than looking out after people
      and showing tempers in public. A woman ought to have good manners. Else it&rsquo;s
      intolerable to appear with her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen made the expected application, and was not without alarm at the
      notion of being a gawky. For she, too, with her melancholy distaste for
      things, preferred that her distaste should include admirers. But the sense
      of overhanging rebuke only intensified the strain of expectation toward
      any meeting with Deronda. The novelty and excitement of her town life was
      like the hurry and constant change of foreign travel; whatever might be
      the inward despondency, there was a programme to be fulfilled, not without
      gratification to many-sided self. But, as always happens with a deep
      interest, the comparatively rare occasions on which she could exchange any
      words with Deronda had a diffusive effect in her consciousness, magnifying
      their communication with each other, and therefore enlarging the place she
      imagined it to have in his mind. How could Deronda help this? He certainly
      did not avoid her; rather he wished to convince her by every delicate
      indirect means that her confidence in him had not been indiscreet since it
      had not lowered his respect. Moreover he liked being near her&mdash;how
      could it be otherwise? She was something more than a problem: she was a
      lovely woman, for the turn of whose mind and fate he had a care which,
      however futile it might be, kept soliciting him as a responsibility,
      perhaps all the more that, when he dared to think of his own future, he
      saw it lying far away from this splendid sad-hearted creature, who,
      because he had once been impelled to arrest her attention momentarily, as
      he might have seized her arm with warning to hinder her from stepping
      where there was danger, had turned to him with a beseeching persistent
      need.
    </p>
    <p>
      One instance in which Grandcourt stimulated a feeling in Gwendolen that he
      would have liked to suppress without seeming to care about it, had
      relation to Mirah. Gwendolen&rsquo;s inclination lingered over the project
      of the singing lessons as a sort of obedience to Deronda&rsquo;s advice,
      but day followed day with that want of perceived leisure which belongs to
      lives where there is no work to mark off intervals; and the continual
      liability to Grandcourt&rsquo;s presence and surveillance seemed to
      flatten every effort to the level of the boredom which his manner
      expressed; his negative mind was as diffusive as fog, clinging to all
      objects, and spoiling all contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one morning when they were breakfasting, Gwendolen, in a recurrent fit
      of determination to exercise the old spirit, said, dallying prettily over
      her prawns without eating them,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think of making myself accomplished while we are in town, and
      having singing lessons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Grandcourt, languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; echoed Gwendolen, playing at sauciness; &ldquo;because
      I can&rsquo;t eat <i>pâté de foie gras</i> to make me sleepy, and I can&rsquo;t
      smoke, and I can&rsquo;t go to the club to make me like to come away again&mdash;I
      want a variety of <i>ennui</i>. What would be the most convenient time,
      when you are busy with your lawyers and people, for me to have lessons
      from that little Jewess, whose singing is getting all the rage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you like,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, pushing away his plate,
      and leaning back in his chair while he looked at her with his most
      lizard-like expression and, played with the ears of the tiny spaniel on
      his lap (Gwendolen had taken a dislike to the dogs because they fawned on
      him).
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said, languidly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why a lady should sing.
      Amateurs make fools of themselves. A lady can&rsquo;t risk herself in that
      way in company. And one doesn&rsquo;t want to hear squalling in private.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like frankness: that seems to me a husband&rsquo;s great charm,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, with her little upward movement of her chin, as she turned
      her eyes away from his, and lifting a prawn before her, looked at the
      boiled ingenuousness of its eyes as preferable to the lizard&rsquo;s.
      &ldquo;But;&rdquo; she added, having devoured her mortification, &ldquo;I
      suppose you don&rsquo;t object to Miss Lapidoth&rsquo;s singing at our
      party on the fourth? I thought of engaging her. Lady Brackenshaw had her,
      you know: and the Raymonds, who are very particular about their music. And
      Mr. Deronda, who is a musician himself and a first-rate judge, says there
      is no singing in such good taste as hers for a drawing-room. I think his
      opinion is an authority.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She meant to sling a small stone at her husband in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very indecent of Deronda to go about praising that girl,&rdquo;
      said Grandcourt in a tone of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indecent!&rdquo; exclaimed Gwendolen, reddening and looking at him
      again, overcome by startled wonder, and unable to reflect on the probable
      falsity of the phrase&mdash;&ldquo;to go about praising.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and especially when she is patronized by Lady Mallinger. He
      ought to hold his tongue about her. Men can see what is his relation to
      her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men who judge of others by themselves,&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      turning white after her redness, and immediately smitten with a dread of
      her own words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. And a woman should take their judgment&mdash;else she is
      likely to run her head into the wrong place,&rdquo; said Grandcourt,
      conscious of using pinchers on that white creature. &ldquo;I suppose you
      take Deronda for a saint.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear no!&rdquo; said Gwendolen, summoning desperately her almost
      miraculous power of self-control, and speaking in a high hard tone.
      &ldquo;Only a little less of a monster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, pushed her chair away without hurry, and walked out of the room
      with something like the care of a man who is afraid of showing that he has
      taken more wine than usual. She turned the keys inside her dressing-room
      doors, and sat down for some time looking pale and quiet as when she was
      leaving the breakfast-room. Even in the moments after reading the
      poisonous letter she had hardly had more cruel sensations than now; for
      emotion was at the acute point, where it is not distinguishable from
      sensation. Deronda unlike what she had believed him to be, was an image
      which affected her as a hideous apparition would have done, quite apart
      from the way in which it was produced. It had taken hold of her as pain
      before she could consider whether it were fiction or truth; and further to
      hinder her power of resistance came the sudden perception, how very slight
      were the grounds of her faith in Deronda&mdash;how little she knew of his
      life&mdash;how childish she had been in her confidence. His rebukes and
      his severity to her began to seem odious, along with all the poetry and
      lofty doctrine in the world, whatever it might be; and the grave beauty of
      his face seemed the most unpleasant mask that the common habits of men
      could put on.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this went on in her with the rapidity of a sick dream; and her start
      into resistance was very much like a waking. Suddenly from out the gray
      sombre morning there came a stream of sunshine, wrapping her in warmth and
      light where she sat in stony stillness. She moved gently and looked round
      her&mdash;there was a world outside this bad dream, and the dream proved
      nothing; she rose, stretching her arms upward and clasping her hands with
      her habitual attitude when she was seeking relief from oppressive feeling,
      and walked about the room in this flood of sunbeams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not true! What does it matter whether <i>he</i> believes it
      or not?&rdquo; This is what she repeated to herself&mdash;but this was not
      her faith come back again; it was only the desperate cry of faith, finding
      suffocation intolerable. And how could she go on through the day in this
      state? With one of her impetuous alternations, her imagination flew to
      wild actions by which she would convince herself of what she wished: she
      would go to Lady Mallinger and question her about Mirah; she would write
      to Deronda and upbraid him with making the world all false and wicked and
      hopeless to her&mdash;to him she dared pour out all the bitter indignation
      of her heart. No; she would go to Mirah. This last form taken by her need
      was more definitely practicable, and quickly became imperious. No matter
      what came of it. She had the pretext of asking Mirah to sing at her party
      on the fourth. What was she going to say beside? How satisfy? She did not
      foresee&mdash;she could not wait to foresee. If that idea which was
      maddening her had been a living thing, she would have wanted to throttle
      it without waiting to foresee what would come of the act. She rang her
      bell and asked if Mr. Grandcourt were gone out: finding that he was, she
      ordered the carriage, and began to dress for the drive; then she went
      down, and walked about the large drawing-room like an imprisoned dumb
      creature, not recognizing herself in the glass panels, not noting any
      object around her in the painted gilded prison. Her husband would probably
      find out where she had been, and punish her in some way or other&mdash;no
      matter&mdash;she could neither desire nor fear anything just now but the
      assurance that she had not been deluding herself in her trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was provided with Mirah&rsquo;s address. Soon she was on the way with
      all the fine equipage necessary to carry about her poor uneasy heart,
      depending in its palpitations on some answer or other to questioning which
      she did not know how she should put. She was as heedless of what happened
      before she found that Miss Lapidoth was at home, as one is of lobbies and
      passages on the way to a court of justice&mdash;heedless of everything
      till she was in a room where there were folding-doors, and she heard
      Deronda&rsquo;s voice behind it. Doubtless the identification was helped
      by forecast, but she was as certain of it as if she had seen him. She was
      frightened at her own agitation, and began to unbutton her gloves that she
      might button them again, and bite her lips over the pretended difficulty,
      while the door opened, and Mirah presented herself with perfect quietude
      and a sweet smile of recognition. There was relief in the sight of her
      face, and Gwendolen was able to smile in return, while she put out her
      hand in silence; and as she seated herself, all the while hearing the
      voice, she felt some reflux of energy in the confused sense that the truth
      could not be anything that she dreaded. Mirah drew her chair very near, as
      if she felt that the sound of the conversation should be subdued, and
      looked at her visitor with placid expectation, while Gwendolen began in a
      low tone, with something that seemed like bashfulness,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you wonder to see me&mdash;perhaps I ought to have written&mdash;but
      I wished to make a particular request.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see you instead of having a letter,&rdquo; said Mirah,
      wondering at the changed expression and manner of the &ldquo;Vandyke
      duchess,&rdquo; as Hans had taught her to call Gwendolen. The rich color
      and the calmness of her own face were in strong contrast with the pale
      agitated beauty under the plumed hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; Gwendolen went on&mdash;&ldquo;at least I hoped,
      you would not object to sing at our house on the 4th&mdash;in the evening&mdash;at
      a party like Lady Brackenshaw&rsquo;s. I should be so much obliged.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very happy to sing for you. At ten?&rdquo; said Mirah,
      while Gwendolen seemed to get more instead of less embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At ten, please,&rdquo; she answered; then paused, and felt that she
      had nothing more to say. She could not go. It was impossible to rise and
      say good-bye. Deronda&rsquo;s voice was in her ears. She must say it&mdash;she
      could contrive no other sentence,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Deronda is in the next room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mirah, in her former tone. &ldquo;He is reading
      Hebrew with my brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a brother?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, who had heard this from
      Lady Mallinger, but had not minded it then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a dear brother who is ill&mdash;consumptive, and Mr. Deronda
      is the best of friends to him, as he has been to me,&rdquo; said Mirah,
      with the impulse that will not let us pass the mention of a precious
      person indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, putting her hand on Mirah&rsquo;s,
      and speaking hardly above a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;tell me&mdash;tell me the
      truth. You are sure he is quite good. You know no evil of him. Any evil
      that people say of him is false.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Could the proud-spirited woman have behaved more like a child? But the
      strange words penetrated Mirah with nothing but a sense of solemnity and
      indignation. With a sudden light in her eyes and a tremor in her voice,
      she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are the people that say evil of him? I would not believe any
      evil of him, if an angel came to tell it me. He found me when I was so
      miserable&mdash;I was going to drown myself; I looked so poor and
      forsaken; you would have thought I was a beggar by the wayside. And he
      treated me as if I had been a king&rsquo;s daughter. He took me to the
      best of women. He found my brother for me. And he honors my brother&mdash;though
      he too was poor&mdash;oh, almost as poor as he could be. And my brother
      honors him. That is no light thing to say&rdquo;&mdash;here Mirah&rsquo;s
      tone changed to one of profound emphasis, and she shook her head backward:
      &ldquo;for my brother is very learned and great-minded. And Mr. Deronda
      says there are few men equal to him.&rdquo; Some Jewish defiance had
      flamed into her indignant gratitude and her anger could not help including
      Gwendolen since she seemed to have doubted Deronda&rsquo;s goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gwendolen was like one parched with thirst, drinking the fresh water
      that spreads through the frame as a sufficient bliss. She did not notice
      that Mirah was angry with her; she was not distinctly conscious of
      anything but of the penetrating sense that Deronda and his life were no
      more like her husband&rsquo;s conception than the morning in the horizon
      was like the morning mixed with street gas. Even Mirah&rsquo;s words sank
      into the indefiniteness of her relief. She could hardly have repeated
      them, or said how her whole state of feeling was changed. She pressed
      Mirah&rsquo;s hand, and said, &ldquo;Thank you, thank you,&rdquo; in a
      hurried whisper, then rose, and added, with only a hazy consciousness,
      &ldquo;I must go, I shall see you&mdash;on the fourth&mdash;I am so much
      obliged&rdquo;&mdash;bowing herself out automatically, while Mirah,
      opening the door for her, wondered at what seemed a sudden retreat into
      chill loftiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen, indeed, had no feeling to spare in any effusiveness toward the
      creature who had brought her relief. The passionate need of contradiction
      to Grandcourt&rsquo;s estimate of Deronda, a need which had blunted her
      sensibility to everything else, was no sooner satisfied than she wanted to
      be gone. She began to be aware that she was out of place, and to dread
      Deronda&rsquo;s seeing her. And once in the carriage again, she had the
      vision of what awaited her at home. When she drew up before the door in
      Grosvenor Square, her husband was arriving with a cigar between his
      fingers. He threw it away and handed her out, accompanying her up-stairs.
      She turned into the drawing-room, lest he should follow her farther and
      give her no place to retreat to; then she sat down with a weary air,
      taking off her gloves, rubbing her hand over her forehead, and making his
      presence as much of a cipher as possible. But he sat, too, and not far
      from her&mdash;just in front, where to avoid looking at him must have the
      emphasis of effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask where you have been at this extraordinary hour?&rdquo;
      said Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I have been to Miss Lapidoth&rsquo;s, to ask her to come
      and sing for us,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, laying her gloves on the little
      table beside her, and looking down at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to ask her about her relations with Deronda?&rdquo; said
      Grandcourt, with the coldest possible sneer in his low voice which in poor
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s ear was diabolical.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time since their marriage she flashed out upon him without
      inward check. Turning her eyes full on his she said, in a biting tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and what you said is false&mdash;a low, wicked falsehood.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told you so&mdash;did she?&rdquo; returned Grandcourt, with a
      more thoroughly distilled sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen was mute. The daring anger within her was turned into the rage
      of dumbness. What reasons for her belief could she give? All the reasons
      that seemed so strong and living within her&mdash;she saw them suffocated
      and shrivelled up under her husband&rsquo;s breath. There was no proof to
      give, but her own impression, which would seem to him her own folly. She
      turned her head quickly away from him and looked angrily toward the end of
      the room: she would have risen, but he was in her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt saw his advantage. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no consequence so far
      as her singing goes,&rdquo; he said, in his superficial drawl. &ldquo;You
      can have her to sing, if you like.&rdquo; Then, after a pause, he added in
      his lowest imperious tone, &ldquo;But you will please to observe that you
      are not to go near that house again. As my wife, you must take my word
      about what is proper for you. When you undertook to be Mrs. Grandcourt,
      you undertook not to make a fool of yourself. You have been making a fool
      of yourself this morning; and if you were to go on as you have begun, you
      might soon get yourself talked of at the clubs in a way you would not
      like. What do <i>you</i> know about the world? You have married <i>me</i>,
      and must be guided by my opinion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Every slow sentence of that speech had a terrific mastery in it for
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s nature. If the low tones had come from a physician
      telling her that her symptoms were those of a fatal disease, and
      prognosticating its course, she could not have been more helpless against
      the argument that lay in it. But she was permitted to move now, and her
      husband never again made any reference to what had occurred this morning.
      He knew the force of his own words. If this white-handed man with the
      perpendicular profile had been sent to govern a difficult colony, he might
      have won reputation among his contemporaries. He had certainly ability,
      would have understood that it was safer to exterminate than to cajole
      superseded proprietors, and would not have flinched from making things
      safe in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen did not, for all this, part with her recovered faith;&mdash;rather,
      she kept it with a more anxious tenacity, as a Protestant of old kept his
      bible hidden or a Catholic his crucifix, according to the side favored by
      the civil arm; and it was characteristic of her that apart from the
      impression gained concerning Deronda in that visit, her imagination was
      little occupied with Mirah or the eulogised brother. The one result
      established for her was, that Deronda had acted simply as a generous
      benefactor, and the phrase &ldquo;reading Hebrew&rdquo; had fleeted
      unimpressively across her sense of hearing, as a stray stork might have
      made its peculiar flight across her landscape without rousing any
      surprised reflection on its natural history.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the issue of that visit, as it regarded her husband, took a strongly
      active part in the process which made an habitual conflict within her, and
      was the cause of some external change perhaps not observed by any one
      except Deronda. As the weeks went on bringing occasional transient
      interviews with her, he thought that he perceived in her an intensifying
      of her superficial hardness and resolute display, which made her abrupt
      betrayals of agitation the more marked and disturbing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, she was undergoing a sort of discipline for the refractory which,
      as little as possible like conversion, bends half the self with a terrible
      strain, and exasperates the unwillingness of the other half. Grandcourt
      had an active divination rather than discernment of refractoriness in her,
      and what had happened about Mirah quickened his suspicion that there was
      an increase of it dependent on the occasions when she happened to see
      Deronda: there was some &ldquo;confounded nonsense&rdquo; between them: he
      did not imagine it exactly as flirtation, and his imagination in other
      branches was rather restricted; but it was nonsense that evidently kept up
      a kind of simmering in her mind&mdash;an inward action which might become
      disagreeable outward. Husbands in the old time are known to have suffered
      from a threatening devoutness in their wives, presenting itself first
      indistinctly as oddity, and ending in that mild form of lunatic asylum, a
      nunnery: Grandcourt had a vague perception of threatening moods in
      Gwendolen which the unity between them in his views of marriage required
      him peremptorily to check. Among the means he chose, one was peculiar, and
      was less ably calculated than the speeches we have just heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He determined that she should know the main purport of the will he was
      making, but he could not communicate this himself, because it involved the
      fact of his relation to Mrs. Glasher and her children; and that there
      should be any overt recognition of this between Gwendolen and himself was
      supremely repugnant to him. Like all proud, closely-wrapped natures, he
      shrank from explicitness and detail, even on trivialities, if they were
      personal: a valet must maintain a strict reserve with him on the subject
      of shoes and stockings. And clashing was intolerable to him; his habitual
      want was to put collision out of the question by the quiet massive
      pressure of his rule. But he wished Gwendolen to know that before he made
      her an offer it was no secret to him that she was aware of his relations
      with Lydia, her previous knowledge being the apology for bringing the
      subject before her now. Some men in his place might have thought of
      writing what he wanted her to know, in the form of a letter. But
      Grandcourt hated writing: even writing a note was a bore to him, and he
      had long been accustomed to have all his writing done by Lush. We know
      that there are persons who will forego their own obvious interest rather
      than do anything so disagreeable as to write letters; and it is not
      probable that these imperfect utilitarians would rush into manuscript and
      syntax on a difficult subject in order to save another&rsquo;s feelings.
      To Grandcourt it did not even occur that he should, would, or could write
      to Gwendolen the information in question; and the only medium of
      communication he could use was Lush, who, to his mind, was as much of an
      implement as pen and paper. But here too Grandcourt had his reserves, and
      would not have uttered a word likely to encourage Lush in an impudent
      sympathy with any supposed grievance in a marriage which had been
      discommended by him. Who that has a confidant escapes believing too little
      in his penetration, and too much in his discretion? Grandcourt had always
      allowed Lush to know his external affairs indiscriminately&mdash;irregularities,
      debts, want of ready money; he had only used discrimination about what he
      would allow his confidant to say to him; and he had been so accustomed to
      this human tool, that the having him at call in London was a recovery of
      lost ease. It followed that Lush knew all the provisions of the will more
      exactly than they were known to the testator himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt did not doubt that Gwendolen, since she was a woman who could
      put two and two together, knew or suspected Lush to be the contriver of
      her interview with Lydia, and that this was the reason why her first
      request was for his banishment. But the bent of a woman&rsquo;s inferences
      on mixed subjects which excites mixed passions is not determined by her
      capacity for simple addition; and here Grandcourt lacked the only organ of
      thinking that could have saved him from mistake&mdash;namely, some
      experience of the mixed passions concerned. He had correctly divined
      one-half of Gwendolen&rsquo;s dread&mdash;all that related to her personal
      pride, and her perception that his will must conquer hers; but the
      remorseful half, even if he had known of her broken promise, was as much
      out of his imagination as the other side of the moon. What he believed her
      to feel about Lydia was solely a tongue-tied jealousy, and what he
      believed Lydia to have written with the jewels was the fact that she had
      once been used to wearing them, with other amenities such as he imputed to
      the intercourse with jealous women. He had the triumphant certainty that
      he could aggravate the jealousy and yet smite it with a more absolute
      dumbness. His object was to engage all his wife&rsquo;s egoism on the same
      side as his own, and in his employment of Lush he did not intend an insult
      to her: she ought to understand that he was the only possible envoy.
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s view of things was considerably fenced in by his
      general sense, that what suited him others must put up with. There is no
      escaping the fact that want of sympathy condemns us to corresponding
      stupidity. Mephistopheles thrown upon real life, and obliged to manage his
      own plots, would inevitably make blunders.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning he went to Gwendolen in the boudoir beyond the back
      drawing-room, hat and gloves in hand, and said with his best-tempered,
      most persuasive drawl, standing before her and looking down on her as she
      sat with a book on her lap,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;Gwendolen, there&rsquo;s some business about property to be
      explained. I have told Lush to come and explain it to you. He knows all
      about these things. I am going out. He can come up now. He&rsquo;s the
      only person who can explain. I suppose you&rsquo;ll not mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I do mind,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, angrily, starting
      up. &ldquo;I shall not see him.&rdquo; She showed the intention to dart
      away to the door. Grandcourt was before her, with his back toward it. He
      was prepared for her anger, and showed none in return, saying, with the
      same sort of remonstrant tone that he might have used about an objection
      to dining out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use making a fuss. There are plenty of brutes in the
      world that one has to talk to. People with any <i>savoir vivre</i> don&rsquo;t
      make a fuss about such things. Some business must be done. You can&rsquo;t
      expect agreeable people to do it. If I employ Lush, the proper thing for
      you is to take it as a matter of course. Not to make a fuss about it. Not
      to toss your head and bite your lips about people of that sort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawling and the pauses with which this speech was uttered gave time
      for crowding reflections in Gwendolen, quelling her resistance. What was
      there to be told her about property? This word had certain dominant
      associations for her, first with her mother, then with Mrs. Glasher and
      her children. What would be the use if she refused to see Lush? Could she
      ask Grandcourt to tell her himself? That might be intolerable, even if he
      consented, which it was certain he would not, if he had made up his mind
      to the contrary. The humiliation of standing an obvious prisoner, with her
      husband barring the door, was not to be borne any longer, and she turned
      away to lean against a cabinet, while Grandcourt again moved toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have arranged for Lush to come up now, while I am out,&rdquo; he
      said, after a long organ stop, during which Gwendolen made no sign.
      &ldquo;Shall I tell him he may come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet another pause before she could say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;her face
      turned obliquely and her eyes cast down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall come back in time to ride, if you like to get ready,&rdquo;
      said Grandcourt. No answer. &ldquo;She is in a desperate rage,&rdquo;
      thought he. But the rage was silent, and therefore not disagreeable to
      him. It followed that he turned her chin and kissed her, while she still
      kept her eyelids down, and she did not move them until he was on the other
      side of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was she to do? Search where she would in her consciousness, she found
      no plea to justify a plaint. Any romantic illusions she had had in
      marrying this man had turned on her power of using him as she liked. He
      was using her as he liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat awaiting the announcement of Lush as a sort of searing operation
      that she had to go through. The facts that galled her gathered a burning
      power when she thought of their lying in his mind. It was all a part of
      that new gambling, in which the losing was not simply a <i>minus</i>, but
      a terrible <i>plus</i> that had never entered into her reckoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lush was neither quite pleased nor quite displeased with his task.
      Grandcourt had said to him by way of conclusion, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make
      yourself more disagreeable than nature obliges you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; thought Lush. But he said, &ldquo;I will write
      a brief abstract for Mrs. Grandcourt to read.&rdquo; He did not suggest
      that he should make the whole communication in writing, which was a proof
      that the interview did not wholly displease him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some provision was being made for himself in the will, and he had no
      reason to be in a bad humor, even if a bad humor had been common with him.
      He was perfectly convinced that he had penetrated all the secrets of the
      situation; but he had no diabolical delight in it. He had only the small
      movements of gratified self-loving resentment in discerning that this
      marriage had fulfilled his own foresight in not being as satisfactory as
      the supercilious young lady had expected it to be, and as Grandcourt
      wished to feign that it was. He had no persistent spite much stronger than
      what gives the seasoning of ordinary scandal to those who repeat it and
      exaggerate it by their conjectures. With no active compassion or
      good-will, he had just as little active malevolence, being chiefly
      occupied in liking his particular pleasures, and not disliking anything
      but what hindered those pleasures&mdash;everything else ranking with the
      last murder and the last <i>opéra bouffe</i>, under the head of things to
      talk about. Nevertheless, he was not indifferent to the prospect of being
      treated uncivilly by a beautiful woman, or to the counter-balancing fact
      that his present commission put into his hands an official power of
      humiliating her. He did not mean to use it needlessly; but there are some
      persons so gifted in relation to us that their &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo;
      seems charged with offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time that Mr. Lush was announced, Gwendolen had braced herself to a
      bitter resolve that he should not witness the slightest betrayal of her
      feeling, whatever he might have to tell. She invited him to sit down with
      stately quietude. After all, what was this man to her? He was not in the
      least like her husband. Her power of hating a coarse, familiar-mannered
      man, with clumsy hands, was now relaxed by the intensity with which she
      hated his contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held a small paper folded in his hand while he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need hardly say that I should not have presented myself if Mr.
      Grandcourt had not expressed a strong wish to that effect&mdash;as no
      doubt he has mentioned to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From some voices that speech might have sounded entirely reverential, and
      even timidly apologetic. Lush had no intention to the contrary, but to
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s ear his words had as much insolence in them as his
      prominent eyes, and the pronoun &ldquo;you&rdquo; was too familiar. He
      ought to have addressed the folding-screen, and spoke of her as Mrs.
      Grandcourt. She gave the smallest sign of a bow, and Lush went on, with a
      little awkwardness, getting entangled in what is elegantly called
      tautology.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My having been in Mr. Grandcourt&rsquo;s confidence for fifteen
      years or more&mdash;since he was a youth, in fact&mdash;of course gives me
      a peculiar position. He can speak to me of affairs that he could not
      mention to any one else; and, in fact, he could not have employed any one
      else in this affair. I have accepted the task out of friendship for him.
      Which is my apology for accepting the task&mdash;if you would have
      preferred some one else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, but she made no sign, and Lush, to give himself a countenance
      in an apology which met no acceptance, opened the folded paper, and looked
      at it vaguely before he began to speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This paper contains some information about Mr. Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      will, an abstract of a part he wished you to know&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll be
      good enough to cast your eyes over it. But there is something I had to say
      by way of introduction&mdash;which I hope you&rsquo;ll pardon me for, if
      it&rsquo;s not quite agreeable.&rdquo; Lush found that he was behaving
      better than he had expected, and had no idea how insulting he made himself
      with his &ldquo;not quite agreeable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say what you have to say without apologizing, please,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, with the air she might have bestowed on a dog-stealer come to
      claim a reward for finding the dog he had stolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only to remind you of something that occurred before your
      engagement to Mr. Grandcourt,&rdquo; said Lush, not without the rise of
      some willing insolence in exchange for her scorn. &ldquo;You met a lady in
      Cardell Chase, if you remember, who spoke to you of her position with
      regard to Mr. Grandcourt. She had children with her&mdash;one a very fine
      boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s lips were almost as pale as her cheeks; her passion had
      no weapons&mdash;words were no better than chips. This man&rsquo;s speech
      was like a sharp knife-edge drawn across her skin: but even her
      indignation at the employment of Lush was getting merged in a crowd of
      other feelings, dim and alarming as a crowd of ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Grandcourt was aware that you were acquainted with this
      unfortunate affair beforehand, and he thinks it only right that his
      position and intentions should be made quite clear to you. It is an affair
      of property and prospects; and if there were any objection you had to
      make, if you would mention it to me&mdash;it is a subject which of course
      he would rather not speak about himself&mdash;if you will be good enough
      just to read this.&rdquo; With the last words Lush rose and presented the
      paper to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Gwendolen resolved that she would betray no feeling in the presence
      of this man, she had not prepared herself to hear that her husband knew
      the silent consciousness, the silently accepted terms on which she had
      married him. She dared not raise her hand to take the paper, least it
      should visibly tremble. For a moment Lush stood holding it toward her, and
      she felt his gaze on her as ignominy, before she could say even with
      low-toned haughtiness,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay it on the table. And go into the next room, please.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lush obeyed, thinking as he took an easy-chair in the back drawing-room,
      &ldquo;My lady winces considerably. She didn&rsquo;t know what would be
      the charge for that superfine article, Henleigh Grandcourt.&rdquo; But it
      seemed to him that a penniless girl had done better than she had any right
      to expect, and that she had been uncommonly knowing for her years and
      opportunities: her words to Lydia meant nothing, and her running away had
      probably been part of her adroitness. It had turned out a master-stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Gwendolen was rallying her nerves to the reading of the paper.
      She must read it. Her whole being&mdash;pride, longing for rebellion,
      dreams of freedom, remorseful conscience, dread of fresh visitation&mdash;all
      made one need to know what the paper contained. But at first it was not
      easy to take in the meaning of the words. When she had succeeded, she
      found that in the case of there being no son as issue of her marriage,
      Grandcourt had made the small Henleigh his heir; that was all she cared to
      extract from the paper with any distinctness. The other statement as to
      what provision would be made for her in the same case, she hurried over,
      getting only a confused perception of thousands and Gadsmere. It was
      enough. She could dismiss the man in the next room with the defiant energy
      which had revived in her at the idea that this question of property and
      inheritance was meant as a finish to her humiliations and her thraldom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thrust the paper between the leaves of her book, which she took in her
      hand, and walked with her stateliest air into the next room, where Lush
      immediately arose, awaiting her approach. When she was four yards from
      him, it was hardly an instant that she paused to say in a high tone, while
      she swept him with her eyelashes,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Mr. Grandcourt that his arrangements are just what I desired&rdquo;&mdash;passing
      on without haste, and leaving Lush time to mingle some admiration of her
      graceful back with that half-amused sense of her spirit and impertinence,
      which he expressed by raising his eyebrows and just thrusting his tongue
      between his teeth. He really did not want her to be worse punished, and he
      was glad to think that it was time to go and lunch at the club, where he
      meant to have a lobster salad.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did Gwendolen look forward to? When her husband returned he found her
      equipped in her riding-dress, ready to ride out with him. She was not
      again going to be hysterical, or take to her bed and say she was ill. That
      was the implicit resolve adjusting her muscles before she could have
      framed it in words, as she walked out of the room, leaving Lush behind
      her. She was going to act in the spirit of her message, and not to give
      herself time to reflect. She rang the bell for her maid, and went with the
      usual care through her change of toilet. Doubtless her husband had meant
      to produce a great effect on her: by-and-by perhaps she would let him see
      an effect the very opposite of what he intended; but at present all that
      she could show was a defiant satisfaction in what had been presumed to be
      disagreeable. It came as an instinct rather than a thought, that to show
      any sign which could be interpreted as jealousy, when she had just been
      insultingly reminded that the conditions were what she had accepted with
      her eyes open, would be the worst self-humiliation. She said to herself
      that she had not time to-day to be clear about her future actions; all she
      could be clear about was that she would match her husband in ignoring any
      ground for excitement. She not only rode, but went out with him to dine,
      contributing nothing to alter their mutual manner, which was never that of
      rapid interchange in discourse; and curiously enough she rejected a
      handkerchief on which her maid had by mistake put the wrong scent&mdash;a
      scent that Grandcourt had once objected to. Gwendolen would not have liked
      to be an object of disgust to this husband whom she hated: she liked all
      disgust to be on her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to defer thought in this way was something like trying to talk without
      singing in her own ears. The thought that is bound up with our passion is
      as penetrative as air&mdash;everything is porous to it; bows, smiles,
      conversation, repartee, are mere honeycombs where such thoughts rushes
      freely, not always with a taste of honey. And without shutting herself up
      in any solitude, Gwendolen seemed at the end of nine or ten hours to have
      gone through a labyrinth of reflection, in which already the same
      succession of prospects had been repeated, the same fallacious outlets
      rejected, the same shrinking from the necessities of every course. Already
      she was undergoing some hardening effect from feeling that she was under
      eyes which saw her past actions solely in the light of her lowest motives.
      She lived back in the scenes of her courtship, with the new bitter
      consciousness of what had been in Grandcourt&rsquo;s mind&mdash;certain
      now, with her present experience of him, that he had a peculiar triumph in
      conquering her dumb repugnance, and that ever since their marriage he had
      had a cold exultation in knowing her fancied secret. Her imagination
      exaggerated every tyrannical impulse he was capable of. &ldquo;I will
      insist on being separated from him&rdquo;&mdash;was her first darting
      determination; then, &ldquo;I will leave him whether he consents or not.
      If this boy becomes his heir, I have made an atonement.&rdquo; But neither
      in darkness nor in daylight could she imagine the scenes which must carry
      out those determinations with the courage to feel them endurable. How
      could she run away to her own family&mdash;carry distress among them, and
      render herself an object of scandal in the society she had left behind
      her? What future lay before her as Mrs. Grandcourt gone back to her
      mother, who would be made destitute again by the rupture of the marriage
      for which one chief excuse had been that it had brought that mother a
      maintenance? She had lately been seeing her uncle and Anna in London, and
      though she had been saved from any difficulty about inviting them to stay
      in Grosvenor Square by their wish to be with Rex, who would not risk a
      meeting with her, the transient visit she had had from them helped now in
      giving stronger color to the picture of what it would be for her to take
      refuge in her own family. What could she say to justify her flight? Her
      uncle would tell her to go back. Her mother would cry. Her aunt and Anna
      would look at her with wondering alarm. Her husband would have power to
      compel her. She had absolutely nothing that she could allege against him
      in judicious or judicial ears. And to &ldquo;insist on separation!&rdquo;
      That was an easy combination of words; but considered as an action to be
      executed against Grandcourt, it would be about as practicable as to give
      him a pliant disposition and a dread of other people&rsquo;s
      unwillingness. How was she to begin? What was she to say that would not be
      a condemnation of herself? &ldquo;If I am to have misery anyhow,&rdquo;
      was the bitter refrain of her rebellious dreams, &ldquo;I had better have
      the misery that I can keep to myself.&rdquo; Moreover, her capability of
      rectitude told her again and again that she had no right to complain of
      her contract, or to withdraw from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And always among the images that drove her back to submission was Deronda.
      The idea of herself separated from her husband, gave Deronda a changed,
      perturbing, painful place in her consciousness: instinctively she felt
      that the separation would be from him too, and in the prospective vision
      of herself as a solitary, dubiously-regarded woman, she felt some tingling
      bashfulness at the remembrance of her behavior towards him. The
      association of Deronda with a dubious position for herself was
      intolerable. And what would he say if he knew everything? Probably that
      she ought to bear what she had brought on herself, unless she were sure
      that she could make herself a better woman by taking any other course. And
      what sort of woman was she to be&mdash;solitary, sickened of life, looked
      at with a suspicious kind of pity?&mdash;even if she could dream of
      success in getting that dreary freedom. Mrs. Grandcourt &ldquo;run away&rdquo;
      would be a more pitiable creature than Gwendolen Harleth condemned to
      teach the bishop&rsquo;s daughters, and to be inspected by Mrs. Mompert.
    </p>
    <p>
      One characteristic trait in her conduct is worth mentioning. She would not
      look a second time at the paper Lush had given her; and before ringing for
      her maid she locked it up in a traveling-desk which was at hand, proudly
      resolved against curiosity about what was allotted to herself in
      connection with Gadsmere&mdash;feeling herself branded in the minds of her
      husband and his confidant with the meanness that would accept marriage and
      wealth on any conditions, however dishonorable and humiliating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day the same pattern of thinking was repeated. There came
      nothing to change the situation&mdash;no new elements in the sketch&mdash;only
      a recurrence which engraved it. The May weeks went on into June, and still
      Mrs. Grandcourt was outwardly in the same place, presenting herself as she
      was expected to do in the accustomed scenes, with the accustomed grace,
      beauty, and costume; from church at one end of the week, through all the
      scale of desirable receptions, to opera at the other. Church was not
      markedly distinguished in her mind from the other forms of
      self-presentation, for marriage had included no instruction that enabled
      her to connect liturgy and sermon with any larger order of the world than
      that of unexplained and perhaps inexplicable social fashions. While a
      laudable zeal was laboring to carry the light of spiritual law up the
      alleys where law is chiefly known as the policeman, the brilliant Mrs.
      Grandcourt, condescending a little to a fashionable rector and conscious
      of a feminine advantage over a learned dean, was, so far as pastoral care
      and religious fellowship were concerned, in as complete a solitude as a
      man in a lighthouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we wonder at the practical submission which hid her constructive
      rebellion? The combination is common enough, as we know from the number of
      persons who make us aware of it in their own case by a clamorous unwearied
      statement of the reasons against their submitting to a situation which, on
      inquiry, we discover to be the least disagreeable within their reach. Poor
      Gwendolen had both too much and too little mental power and dignity to
      make herself exceptional. No wonder that Deronda now marked some hardening
      in a look and manner which were schooled daily to the suppression of
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example. One morning, riding in Rotten Row with Grandcourt by her
      side, she saw standing against the railing at the turn, just facing them,
      a dark-eyed lady with a little girl and a blonde boy, whom she at once
      recognized as the beings in all the world the most painful for her to
      behold. She and Grandcourt had just slackened their pace to a walk; he
      being on the outer side was the nearer to the unwelcome vision, and
      Gwendolen had not presence of mind to do anything but glance away from the
      dark eyes that met hers piercingly toward Grandcourt, who wheeled past the
      group with an unmoved face, giving no sign of recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately she felt a rising rage against him mingling with her shame for
      herself, and the words, &ldquo;You might at least have raised your hat to
      her,&rdquo; flew impetuously to her lips&mdash;but did not pass them. If
      as her husband, in her company, he chose to ignore these creatures whom
      she herself had excluded from the place she was filling, how could she be
      the person to reproach him? She was dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not chance, but her own design, that had brought Mrs. Glasher there
      with her boy. She had come to town under the pretext of making purchases&mdash;really
      wanting educational apparatus for her children, and had had interviews
      with Lush in which she had not refused to soothe her uneasy mind by
      representing the probabilities as all on the side of her ultimate triumph.
      Let her keep quiet, and she might live to see the marriage dissolve itself
      in one way or other&mdash;Lush hinted at several ways&mdash;leaving the
      succession assured to her boy. She had had an interview with Grandcourt,
      too, who had as usual told her to behave like a reasonable woman, and
      threatened punishment if she were troublesome; but had, also as usual,
      vindicated himself from any wish to be stingy, the money he was receiving
      from Sir Hugo on account of Diplow encouraging him to be lavish. Lydia,
      feeding on the probabilities in her favor, devoured her helpless wrath
      along with that pleasanter nourishment; but she could not let her
      discretion go entirely without the reward of making a Medusa-apparition
      before Gwendolen, vindictiveness and jealousy finding relief in an outlet
      of venom, though it were as futile as that of a viper already flung on the
      other side of the hedge. Hence, each day, after finding out from Lush the
      likely time for Gwendolen to be riding, she had watched at that post,
      daring Grandcourt so far. Why should she not take little Henleigh into the
      Park?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Medusa-apparition was made effective beyond Lydia&rsquo;s conception
      by the shock it gave Gwendolen actually to see Grandcourt ignoring this
      woman who had once been the nearest in the world to him, along with the
      children she had borne him. And all the while the dark shadow thus cast on
      the lot of a woman destitute of acknowledged social dignity, spread itself
      over her visions of a future that might be her own, and made part of her
      dread on her own behalf. She shrank all the more from any lonely action.
      What possible release could there be for her from this hated vantage
      ground, which yet she dared not quit, any more than if fire had been
      raining outside it? What release, but death? Not her own death. Gwendolen
      was not a woman who could easily think of her own death as a near reality,
      or front for herself the dark entrance on the untried and invisible. It
      seemed more possible that Grandcourt should die:&mdash;and yet not likely.
      The power of tyranny in him seemed a power of living in the presence of
      any wish that he should die. The thought that his death was the only
      possible deliverance for her was one with the thought that deliverance
      would never come&mdash;the double deliverance from the injury with which
      other beings might reproach her and from the yoke she had brought on her
      own neck. No! she foresaw him always living, and her own life dominated by
      him; the &ldquo;always&rdquo; of her young experience not stretching
      beyond the few immediate years that seemed immeasurably long with her
      passionate weariness. The thought of his dying would not subsist: it
      turned as with a dream-change into the terror that she should die with his
      throttling fingers on her neck avenging that thought. Fantasies moved
      within her like ghosts, making no break in her more acknowledged
      consciousness and finding no obstruction in it: dark rays doing their work
      invisibly in the broad light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only an evening or two after that encounter in the Park, there was a grand
      concert at Klesmer&rsquo;s, who was living rather magnificently now in one
      of the large houses in Grosvenor Place, a patron and prince among musical
      professors. Gwendolen had looked forward to this occasion as one on which
      she was sure to meet Deronda, and she had been meditating how to put a
      question to him which, without containing a word that she would feel a
      dislike to utter, would yet be explicit enough for him to understand it.
      The struggle of opposite feelings would not let her abide by her instinct
      that the very idea of Deronda&rsquo;s relation to her was a discouragement
      to any desperate step towards freedom. The next wave of emotion was a
      longing for some word of his to enforce a resolve. The fact that her
      opportunities of conversation with him had always to be snatched in the
      doubtful privacy of large parties, caused her to live through them many
      times beforehand, imagining how they would take place and what she would
      say. The irritation was proportionate when no opportunity came; and this
      evening at Klesmer&rsquo;s she included Deronda in her anger, because he
      looked as calm as possible at a distance from her, while she was in danger
      of betraying her impatience to every one who spoke to her. She found her
      only safety in a chill haughtiness which made Mr. Vandernoodt remark that
      Mrs. Grandcourt was becoming a perfect match for her husband. When at last
      the chances of the evening brought Deronda near her, Sir Hugo and Mrs.
      Raymond were close by and could hear every word she said. No matter: her
      husband was not near, and her irritation passed without check into a fit
      of daring which restored the security of her self-possession. Deronda was
      there at last, and she would compel him to do what she pleased. Already
      and without effort rather queenly in her air as she stood in her white
      lace and green leaves she threw a royal permissiveness into her way of
      saying, &ldquo;I wish you would come and see me to-morrow between five and
      six, Mr. Deronda.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be but one answer at that moment: &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo;
      with a tone of obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward it occurred to Deronda that he would write a note to excuse
      himself. He had always avoided making a call at Grandcourt&rsquo;s. He
      could not persuade himself to any step that might hurt her, and whether
      his excuse were taken for indifference or for the affectation of
      indifference it would be equally wounding. He kept his promise. Gwendolen
      had declined to ride out on the plea of not feeling well enough having
      left her refusal to the last moment when the horses were soon to be at the
      door&mdash;not without alarm lest her husband should say that he too would
      stay at home. Become almost superstitious about his power of suspicious
      divination, she had a glancing forethought of what she would do in that
      case&mdash;namely, have herself denied as not well. But Grandcourt
      accepted her excuse without remark, and rode off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless when Gwendolen found herself alone, and had sent down the
      order that only Mr. Deronda was to be admitted, she began to be alarmed at
      what she had done, and to feel a growing agitation in the thought that he
      would soon appear, and she should soon be obliged to speak: not of
      trivialities, as if she had no serious motive in asking him to come: and
      yet what she had been for hours determining to say began to seem
      impossible. For the first time the impulse of appeal to him was being
      checked by timidity, and now that it was too late she was shaken by the
      possibility that he might think her invitation unbecoming. If so, she
      would have sunk in his esteem. But immediately she resisted this
      intolerable fear as an infection from her husband&rsquo;s way of thinking.
      That <i>he</i> would say she was making a fool of herself was rather a
      reason why such a judgment would be remote from Deronda&rsquo;s mind. But
      that she could not rid herself from this sudden invasion of womanly
      reticence was manifest in a kind of action which had never occurred to her
      before. In her struggle between agitation and the effort to suppress it,
      she was walking up and down the length of the two drawing-rooms, where at
      one end a long mirror reflected her in her black dress, chosen in the
      early morning with a half-admitted reference to this hour. But above this
      black dress her head on its white pillar of a neck showed to advantage.
      Some consciousness of this made her turn hastily and hurry to the boudoir,
      where again there was a glass, but also, tossed over a chair, a large
      piece of black lace which she snatched and tied over her crown of hair so
      as completely to conceal her neck, and leave only her face looking out
      from the black frame. In this manifest contempt of appearance, she thought
      it possible to be freer from nervousness, but the black lace did not take
      away the uneasiness from her eyes and lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing in the middle of the room when Deronda was announced, and
      as he approached her she perceived that he too for some reason was not his
      usual self. She could not have defined the change except by saying that he
      looked less happy than usual, and appeared to be under some effort in
      speaking to her. And yet the speaking was the slightest possible. They
      both said, &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; quite curtly; and Gwendolen,
      instead of sitting down, moved to a little distance, resting her arms
      slightly on the tall back of a chair, while Deronda stood where he was,&mdash;both
      feeling it difficult to say any more, though the preoccupation in his mind
      could hardly have been more remote than it was from Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      conception. She naturally saw in his embarrassment some reflection of her
      own. Forced to speak, she found all her training in concealment and
      self-command of no use to her and began with timid awkwardness,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will wonder why I begged you to come. I wanted to ask you
      something. You said I was ignorant. That is true. And what can I do but
      ask you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And at this moment she was feeling it utterly impossible to put the
      questions she had intended. Something new in her nervous manner roused
      Deronda&rsquo;s anxiety lest there might be a new crisis. He said with the
      sadness of affection in his voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My only regret is, that I can be of so little use to you.&rdquo;
      The words and the tone touched a new spring in her, and she went on with
      more sense of freedom, yet still not saying anything she had designed to
      say, and beginning to hurry, that she might somehow arrive at the right
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to tell you that I have always been thinking of your
      advice, but is it any use?&mdash;I can&rsquo;t make myself different,
      because things about me raise bad feelings&mdash;and I must go on&mdash;I
      can alter nothing&mdash;it is no use.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused an instant, with the consciousness that she was not finding the
      right words, but began again hurriedly, &ldquo;But if I go on I shall get
      worse. I want not to get worse. I should like to be what you wish. There
      are people who are good and enjoy great things&mdash;I know there are. I
      am a contemptible creature. I feel as if I should get wicked with hating
      people. I have tried to think that I would go away from everybody. But I
      can&rsquo;t. There are so many things to hinder me. You think, perhaps,
      that I don&rsquo;t mind. But I do mind. I am afraid of everything. I am
      afraid of getting wicked. Tell me what I can do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had forgotten everything but that image of her helpless misery which
      she was trying to make present to Deronda in broken allusive speech&mdash;wishing
      to convey but not express all her need. Her eyes were tearless, and had a
      look of smarting in their dilated brilliancy; there was a subdued sob in
      her voice which was more and more veiled, till it was hardly above a
      whisper. She was hurting herself with the jewels that glittered on her
      tightly-clasped fingers pressed against her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feeling Deronda endured in these moments he afterward called horrible.
      Words seemed to have no more rescue in them than if he had been beholding
      a vessel in peril of wreck&mdash;the poor ship with its many-lived anguish
      beaten by the inescapable storm. How could he grasp the long-growing
      process of this young creature&rsquo;s wretchedness?&mdash;how arrest and
      change it with a sentence? He was afraid of his own voice. The words that
      rushed into his mind seemed in their feebleness nothing better than
      despair made audible, or than that insensibility to another&rsquo;s
      hardship which applies precept to soothe pain. He felt himself holding a
      crowd of words imprisoned within his lips, as if the letting them escape
      would be a violation of awe before the mysteries of our human lot. The
      thought that urged itself foremost was&mdash;&ldquo;Confess everything to
      your husband; have nothing concealed:&rdquo;&mdash;the words carried in
      his mind a vision of reasons which would have needed much fuller
      expressions for Gwendolen to apprehend them, but before he had begun those
      brief sentences, the door opened and the husband entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt had deliberately gone out and turned back to satisfy a
      suspicion. What he saw was Gwendolen&rsquo;s face of anguish framed black
      like a nun&rsquo;s, and Deronda standing three yards from her with a look
      of sorrow such as he might have bent on the last struggle of life in a
      beloved object. Without any show of surprise Grandcourt nodded to Deronda,
      gave a second look at Gwendolen, passed on, and seated himself easily at a
      little distance crossing his legs, taking out his handkerchief and
      trifling with it elegantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen had shrunk and changed her attitude on seeing him, but she did
      not turn or move from her place. It was not a moment in which she could
      feign anything, or manifest any strong revulsion of feeling: the
      passionate movement of her last speech was still too strong within her.
      What she felt beside was a dull despairing sense that her interview with
      Deronda was at an end: a curtain had fallen. But he, naturally, was urged
      into self-possession and effort by susceptibility to what might follow for
      her from being seen by her husband in this betrayal of agitation; and
      feeling that any pretense of ease in prolonging his visit would only
      exaggerate Grandcourt&rsquo;s possible conjectures of duplicity, he merely
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not stay longer now. Good bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He put out his hand, and she let him press her poor little chill fingers;
      but she said no good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had left the room, Gwendolen threw herself into a seat, with an
      expectation as dull as her despair&mdash;the expectation that she was
      going to be punished. But Grandcourt took no notice: he was satisfied to
      have let her know that she had not deceived him, and to keep a silence
      which was formidable with omniscience. He went out that evening, and her
      plea of feeling ill was accepted without even a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning at breakfast he said, &ldquo;I am going yachting to the
      Mediterranean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a leap of heart which had hope in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day after to-morrow. The yacht is at Marseilles. Lush is gone
      to get everything ready.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I have mamma to stay with me, then?&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      the new sudden possibility of peace and affection filling her mind like a
      burst of morning light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you will go with me.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        Ever in his soul
  That larger justice which makes gratitude
  Triumphed above resentment. &lsquo;Tis the mark
  Of regal natures, with the wider life.
  And fuller capability of joy:&mdash;
  Not wits exultant in the strongest lens
  To show you goodness vanished into pulp
  Never worth &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;&mdash;they&rsquo;re the devil&rsquo;s friars,
  Vowed to be poor as he in love and trust,
  Yet must go begging of a world that keeps
  Some human property.
</pre>
    <p>
      Deronda, in parting from Gwendolen, had abstained from saying, &ldquo;I
      shall not see you again for a long while: I am going away,&rdquo; lest
      Grandcourt should understand him to imply that the fact was of importance
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was actually going away under circumstances so momentous to himself
      that when he set out to fulfill his promise of calling on her, he was
      already under the shadow of a solemn emotion which revived the deepest
      experience of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Hugo had sent for him to his chambers with the note&mdash;&ldquo;Come
      immediately. Something has happened:&rdquo; a preparation that caused him
      some relief when, on entering the baronet&rsquo;s study, he was received
      with grave affection instead of the distress which he had apprehended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing to grieve you, sir?&rdquo; said Deronda, in a tone
      rather of restored confidence than question, as he took the hand held out
      to him. There was an unusual meaning in Sir Hugo&rsquo;s look, and a
      subdued emotion in his voice, as he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dan, no. Sit down. I have something to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda obeyed, not without presentiment. It was extremely rare for Sir
      Hugo to show so much serious feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to grieve me, my boy, no. At least, if there is nothing in it
      that will grieve you too much. But I hardly expected that this&mdash;just
      this&mdash;would ever happen. There have been reasons why I have never
      prepared you for it. There have been reasons why I have never told you
      anything about your parentage. But I have striven in every way not to make
      that an injury to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Hugo paused, but Deronda could not speak. He could not say, &ldquo;I
      have never felt it an injury.&rdquo; Even if that had been true, he could
      not have trusted his voice to say anything. Far more than any one but
      himself could know of was hanging on this moment when the secrecy was to
      be broken. Sir Hugo had never seen the grand face he delighted in so pale&mdash;the
      lips pressed together with such a look of pain. He went on with a more
      anxious tenderness, as if he had a new fear of wounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have acted in obedience to your mother&rsquo;s wishes. The
      secrecy was her wish. But now she desires to remove it. She desires to see
      you. I will put this letter into your hands, which you can look at
      by-and-by. It will merely tell you what she wishes you to do, and where
      you will find her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Hugo held out a letter written on foreign paper, which Deronda thrust
      into his breast-pocket, with a sense of relief that he was not called on
      to read anything immediately. The emotion on Daniel&rsquo;s face had
      gained on the baronet, and was visibly shaking his composure. Sir Hugo
      found it difficult to say more. And Deronda&rsquo;s whole soul was
      possessed by a question which was the hardest in the world to utter. Yet
      he could not bear to delay it. This was a sacramental moment. If he let it
      pass, he could not recover the influences under which it was possible to
      utter the words and meet the answer. For some moments his eyes were cast
      down, and it seemed to both as if thoughts were in the air between them.
      But at last Deronda looked at Sir Hugo, and said, with a tremulous
      reverence in his voice&mdash;dreading to convey indirectly the reproach
      that affection had for years been stifling,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my father also living?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer came immediately in a low emphatic tone&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mingled emotions which followed that answer it was impossible to
      distinguish joy from pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some new light had fallen on the past for Sir Hugo too in this interview.
      After a silence in which Deronda felt like one whose creed is gone before
      he has religiously embraced another, the baronet said, in a tone of
      confession,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I was wrong, Dan, to undertake what I did. And perhaps I
      liked it a little too well&mdash;having you all to myself. But if you have
      had any pain which I might have helped, I ask you to forgive me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The forgiveness has long been there,&rdquo; said Deronda &ldquo;The
      chief pain has always been on account of some one else&mdash;whom I never
      knew&mdash;whom I am now to know. It has not hindered me from feeling an
      affection for you which has made a large part of all the life I remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed one impulse that made the two men clasp each other&rsquo;s hand
      for a moment.

    <p>
      This was the letter which Sir Hugo put into Deronda&rsquo;s hands:,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    TO MY SON, DANIEL DERONDA.

    My good friend and yours, Sir Hugo Mallinger, will have told you that
    I wish to see you. My health is shaken, and I desire there should be
    no time lost before I deliver to you what I have long withheld. Let
    nothing hinder you from being at the <i>Albergo dell&rsquo; Italia</i> in
    Genoa by the fourteenth of this month. Wait for me there. I am
    uncertain when I shall be able to make the journey from Spezia, where
    I shall be staying. That will depend on several things. Wait for
    me&mdash;the Princess Halm-Eberstein. Bring with you the diamond ring that
    Sir Hugo gave you. I shall like to see it again.&mdash;Your unknown mother,

    LEONORA HALM-EBERSTEIN.
</pre>
    <p>
      This letter with its colorless wording gave Deronda no clue to what was in
      reserve for him; but he could not do otherwise than accept Sir Hugo&rsquo;s
      reticence, which seemed to imply some pledge not to anticipate the mother&rsquo;s
      disclosures; and the discovery that his life-long conjectures had been
      mistaken checked further surmise. Deronda could not hinder his imagination
      from taking a quick flight over what seemed possibilities, but he refused
      to contemplate any of them as more likely than another, lest he should be
      nursing it into a dominant desire or repugnance, instead of simply
      preparing himself with resolve to meet the fact bravely, whatever it might
      turn out to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state of mind he could not have communicated to any one the reason
      for the absence which in some quarters he was obliged to mention
      beforehand, least of all to Mordecai, whom it would affect as powerfully
      as it did himself, only in rather a different way. If he were to say,
      &ldquo;I am going to learn the truth about my birth,&rdquo; Mordecai&rsquo;s
      hope would gather what might prove a painful, dangerous excitement. To
      exclude suppositions, he spoke of his journey as being undertaken by Sir
      Hugo&rsquo;s wish, and threw as much indifference as he could into his
      manner of announcing it, saying he was uncertain of its duration, but it
      would perhaps be very short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask to have the child Jacob to stay with me,&rdquo; said
      Mordecai, comforting himself in this way, after the first mournful
      glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will drive round and ask Mrs. Cohen to let him come,&rdquo; said
      Mirah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The grandmother will deny you nothing,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      glad you were a little wrong as well as I,&rdquo; he added, smiling at
      Mordecai. &ldquo;You thought that old Mrs. Cohen would not bear to see
      Mirah.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I undervalued her heart,&rdquo; said Mordecai. &ldquo;She is
      capable of rejoicing that another&rsquo;s plant blooms though her own be
      withered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they are dear good people; I feel as if we all belonged to each
      other,&rdquo; said Mirah, with a tinge of merriment in her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should you have felt if that Ezra had been your brother?&rdquo;
      said Deronda, mischievously&mdash;a little provoked that she had taken
      kindly at once to people who had caused him so much prospective annoyance
      on her account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah looked at him with a slight surprise for a moment, and then said,
      &ldquo;He is not a bad man&mdash;I think he would never forsake any one.&rdquo;
      But when she uttered the words she blushed deeply, and glancing timidly at
      Mordecai, turned away to some occupation. Her father was in her mind, and
      this was a subject on which she and her brother had a painful mutual
      consciousness. &ldquo;If he should come and find us!&rdquo; was a thought
      which to Mirah sometimes made the street daylight as shadowy as a haunted
      forest where each turn screened for her an imaginary apparition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda felt what was her involuntary allusion, and understood the blush.
      How could he be slow to understand feelings which now seemed nearer than
      ever to his own? for the words of his mother&rsquo;s letter implied that
      his filial relation was not to be freed from painful conditions; indeed,
      singularly enough that letter which had brought his mother nearer as a
      living reality had thrown her into more remoteness for his affections. The
      tender yearning after a being whose life might have been the worse for not
      having his care and love, the image of a mother who had not had all her
      dues, whether of reverence or compassion, had long been secretly present
      with him in his observation of all the women he had come near. But it
      seemed now that this picturing of his mother might fit the facts no better
      than his former conceptions about Sir Hugo. He wondered to find that when
      this mother&rsquo;s very hand-writing had come to him with words holding
      her actual feeling, his affections had suddenly shrunk into a state of
      comparative neutrality toward her. A veiled figure with enigmatic speech
      had thrust away that image which, in spite of uncertainty, his clinging
      thought had gradually modeled and made the possessor of his tenderness and
      duteous longing. When he set off to Genoa, the interest really uppermost
      in his mind had hardly so much relation to his mother as to Mordecai and
      Mirah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, Dan!&rdquo; Sir Hugo had said, when they shook
      hands. &ldquo;Whatever else changes for you, it can&rsquo;t change my
      being the oldest friend you have known, and the one who has all along felt
      the most for you. I couldn&rsquo;t have loved you better if you&rsquo;d
      been my own&mdash;only I should have been better pleased with thinking of
      you always as the future master of the Abbey instead of my fine nephew;
      and then you would have seen it necessary for you to take a political
      line. However&mdash;things must be as they may.&rdquo; It was a defensive
      movement of the baronet&rsquo;s to mingle purposeless remarks with the
      expression of serious feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Deronda arrived at the <i>Italia</i> in Genoa, no Princess
      Halm-Eberstein was there; but on the second day there was a letter for
      him, saying that her arrival might happen within a week, or might be
      deferred a fortnight and more; she was under circumstances which made it
      impossible for her to fix her journey more precisely, and she entreated
      him to wait as patiently as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this indefinite prospect of suspense on matters of supreme moment to
      him, Deronda set about the difficult task of seeking amusement on
      philosophic grounds, as a means of quieting excited feeling and giving
      patience a lift over a weary road. His former visit to the superb city had
      been only cursory, and left him much to learn beyond the prescribed round
      of sight-seeing, by spending the cooler hours in observant wandering about
      the streets, the quay, and the environs; and he often took a boat that he
      might enjoy the magnificent view of the city and harbor from the sea. All
      sights, all subjects, even the expected meeting with his mother, found a
      central union in Mordecai and Mirah, and the ideas immediately associated
      with them; and among the thoughts that most filled his mind while his boat
      was pushing about within view of the grand harbor was that of the
      multitudinous Spanish Jews centuries ago driven destitute from their
      Spanish homes, suffered to land from the crowded ships only for a brief
      rest on this grand quay of Genoa, overspreading it with a pall of famine
      and plague&mdash;dying mothers and dying children at their breasts&mdash;fathers
      and sons a-gaze at each other&rsquo;s haggardness, like groups from a
      hundred Hunger-towers turned out beneath the midday sun. Inevitably dreamy
      constructions of a possible ancestry for himself would weave themselves
      with historic memories which had begun to have a new interest for him on
      his discovery of Mirah, and now, under the influence of Mordecai, had
      become irresistibly dominant. He would have sealed his mind against such
      constructions if it had been possible, and he had never yet fully admitted
      to himself that he wished the facts to verify Mordecai&rsquo;s conviction:
      he inwardly repeated that he had no choice in the matter, and that wishing
      was folly&mdash;nay, on the question of parentage, wishing seemed part of
      that meanness which disowns kinship: it was a disowning by anticipation.
      What he had to do was simply to accept the fact; and he had really no
      strong presumption to go upon, now that he was assured of his mistake
      about Sir Hugo. There had been a resolved concealment which made all
      inference untrustworthy, and the very name he bore might be a false one.
      If Mordecai was wrong&mdash;if he, the so-called Daniel Deronda, were held
      by ties entirely aloof from any such course as his friend&rsquo;s pathetic
      hope had marked out?&mdash;he would not say &ldquo;I wish&rdquo;; but he
      could not help feeling on which side the sacrifice lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across these two importunate thoughts, which he resisted as much as one
      can resist anything in that unstrung condition which belongs to suspense,
      there came continually an anxiety which he made no effort to banish&mdash;dwelling
      on it rather with a mournfulness, which often seems to us the best
      atonement we can make to one whose need we have been unable to meet. The
      anxiety was for Gwendolen. In the wonderful mixtures of our nature there
      is a feeling distinct from that exclusive passionate love of which some
      men and women (by no means all) are capable, which yet is not the same
      with friendship, nor with a merely benevolent regard, whether admiring or
      compassionate: a man, say&mdash;for it is a man who is here concerned&mdash;hardly
      represents to himself this shade of feeling toward a woman more nearly
      than in words, &ldquo;I should have loved her, if&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;:
      the &ldquo;if&rdquo; covering some prior growth in the inclinations, or
      else some circumstances which have made an inward prohibitory law as a
      stay against the emotions ready to quiver out of balance. The &ldquo;if&rdquo;
      in Deronda&rsquo;s case carried reasons of both kinds; yet he had never
      throughout his relations with Gwendolen been free from the nervous
      consciousness that there was something to guard against not only on her
      account but on his own&mdash;some precipitancy in the manifestations of
      impulsive feeling&mdash;some ruinous inroad of what is but momentary on
      the permanent chosen treasure of the heart&mdash;some spoiling of her
      trust, which wrought upon him now as if it had been the retreating cry of
      a creature snatched and carried out of his reach by swift horsemen or
      swifter waves, while his own strength was only a stronger sense of
      weakness. How could his feelings for Gwendolen ever be exactly like his
      feelings for other women, even when there was one by whose side he desired
      to stand apart from them? Strangely the figure entered into the pictures
      of his present and future; strangely (and now it seemed sadly) their two
      lots had come in contact, hers narrowly personal, his charged with
      far-reaching sensibilities, perhaps with durable purposes, which were
      hardly more present to her than the reasons why men migrate are present to
      the birds that come as usual for the crumbs and find them no more. Not
      that Deronda was too ready to imagine himself of supreme importance to a
      woman; but her words of insistence that he must &ldquo;remain near her&mdash;must
      not forsake her&rdquo;&mdash;continually recurred to him with the
      clearness and importunity of imagined sounds, such as Dante has said
      pierce us like arrows whose points carry the sharpness of pity,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Lamenti saettaron me diversi
  Che di pieta ferrati avean gli strali&rdquo;.
</pre>
    <p>
      Day after day passed, and the very air of Italy seemed to carry the
      consciousness that war had been declared against Austria, and every day
      was a hurrying march of crowded Time toward the world-changing battle of
      Sadowa. Meanwhile, in Genoa, the noons were getting hotter, the converging
      outer roads getting deeper with white dust, the oleanders in the tubs
      along the wayside gardens looking more and more like fatigued
      holiday-makers, and the sweet evening changing her office&mdash;scattering
      abroad those whom the midday had sent under shelter, and sowing all paths
      with happy social sounds, little tinklings of mule-bells and whirrings of
      thrumbed strings, light footsteps and voices, if not leisurely, then with
      the hurry of pleasure in them; while the encircling heights, crowned with
      forts, skirted with fine dwellings and gardens, seemed also to come forth
      and gaze in fullness of beauty after their long siesta, till all strong
      color melted in the stream of moonlight which made the Streets a new
      spectacle with shadows, both still and moving, on cathedral steps and
      against the façades of massive palaces; and then slowly with the
      descending moon all sank in deep night and silence, and nothing shone but
      the port lights of the great Lanterna in the blackness below, and the
      glimmering stars in the blackness above. Deronda, in his suspense, watched
      this revolving of the days as he might have watched a wonderful clock
      where the striking of the hours was made solemn with antique figures
      advancing and retreating in monitory procession, while he still kept his
      ear open for another kind of signal which would have its solemnity too: He
      was beginning to sicken of occupation, and found himself contemplating all
      activity with the aloofness of a prisoner awaiting ransom. In his letters
      to Mordecai and Hans, he had avoided writing about himself, but he was
      really getting into that state of mind to which all subjects become
      personal; and the few books he had brought to make him a refuge in study
      were becoming unreadable, because the point of view that life would make
      for him was in that agitating moment of uncertainty which is close upon
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many nights were watched through by him in gazing from the open window of
      his room on the double, faintly pierced darkness of the sea and the
      heavens; often in struggling under the oppressive skepticism which
      represented his particular lot, with all the importance he was allowing
      Mordecai to give it, as of no more lasting effect than a dream&mdash;a set
      of changes which made passion to him, but beyond his consciousness were no
      more than an imperceptible difference of mass and shadow; sometimes with a
      reaction of emotive force which gave even to sustained disappointment,
      even to the fulfilled demand of sacrifice, the nature of a satisfied
      energy, and spread over his young future, whatever it might be, the
      attraction of devoted service; sometimes with a sweet irresistible
      hopefulness that the very best of human possibilities might befall him&mdash;the
      blending of a complete personal love in one current with a larger duty;
      and sometimes again in a mood of rebellion (what human creature escapes
      it?) against things in general because they are thus and not otherwise, a
      mood in which Gwendolen and her equivocal fate moved as busy images of
      what was amiss in the world along with the concealments which he had felt
      as a hardship in his own life, and which were acting in him now under the
      form of an afflicting doubtfulness about the mother who had announced
      herself coldly and still kept away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last she was come. One morning in his third week of waiting there
      was a new kind of knock at the door. A servant in Chasseurs livery entered
      and delivered in French the verbal message that, the Princess
      Halm-Eberstein had arrived, that she was going to rest during the day, but
      would be obliged if Monsieur would dine early, so as to be at liberty at
      seven, when she would be able to receive him.

      CHAPTER LI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    She held the spindle as she sat,
    Errina with the thick-coiled mat
    Of raven hair and deepest agate eyes,
    Gazing with a sad surprise
    At surging visions of her destiny&mdash;
    To spin the byssus drearily
    In insect-labor, while the throng
  Of gods and men wrought deeds that poets wrought in song.
</pre>
    <p>
      When Deronda presented himself at the door of his mother&rsquo;s apartment
      in the <i>Italia</i> he felt some revival of his boyhood with its
      premature agitations. The two servants in the antechamber looked at him
      markedly, a little surprised that the doctor their lady had come to
      consult was this striking young gentleman whose appearance gave even the
      severe lines of an evening dress the credit of adornment. But Deronda
      could notice nothing until, the second door being opened, he found himself
      in the presence of a figure which at the other end of the large room stood
      awaiting his approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was covered, except as to her face and part of her arms, with black
      lace hanging loosely from the summit of her whitening hair to the long
      train stretching from her tall figure. Her arms, naked to the elbow,
      except for some rich bracelets, were folded before her, and the fine poise
      of her head made it look handsomer than it really was. But Deronda felt no
      interval of observation before he was close in front of her, holding the
      hand she had put out and then raising it to his lips. She still kept her
      hand in his and looked at him examiningly; while his chief consciousness
      was that her eyes were piercing and her face so mobile that the next
      moment she might look like a different person. For even while she was
      examining him there was a play of the brow and nostril which made a tacit
      language. Deronda dared no movement, not able to conceive what sort of
      manifestation her feeling demanded; but he felt himself changing color
      like a girl, and yet wondering at his own lack of emotion; he had lived
      through so many ideal meetings with his mother, and they had seemed more
      real than this! He could not even conjecture in what language she would
      speak to him. He imagined it would not be English. Suddenly, she let fall
      his hand, and placed both hers on his shoulders, while her face gave out a
      flash of admiration in which every worn line disappeared and seemed to
      leave a restored youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a beautiful creature!&rdquo; she said, in a low melodious
      voice, with syllables which had what might be called a foreign but
      agreeable outline. &ldquo;I knew you would be.&rdquo; Then she kissed him
      on each cheek, and he returned the kisses. But it was something like a
      greeting between royalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment while the lines were coming back into her face, and
      then said in a colder tone, &ldquo;I am your mother. But you can have no
      love for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of you more than of any other being in the world,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, his voice trembling nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not like what you thought I was,&rdquo; said the mother
      decisively, withdrawing her hands from his shoulders, and folding her arms
      as before, looking at him as if she invited him to observe her. He had
      often pictured her face in his imagination as one which had a likeness to
      his own: he saw some of the likeness now, but amidst more striking
      differences. She was a remarkable looking being. What was it that gave her
      son a painful sense of aloofness?&mdash;Her worn beauty had a strangeness
      in it as if she were not quite a human mother, but a Melusina, who had
      ties with some world which is independent of ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to think that you might be suffering,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      anxious above all not to wound her. &ldquo;I used to wish that I could be
      a comfort to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>am</i> suffering. But with a suffering that you can&rsquo;t
      comfort,&rdquo; said the Princess, in a harder voice than before, moving
      to a sofa where cushions had been carefully arranged for her. &ldquo;Sit
      down.&rdquo; She pointed to a seat near her; and then discerning some
      distress in Deronda&rsquo;s face, she added, more gently, &ldquo;I am not
      suffering at this moment. I am at ease now. I am able to talk.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda seated himself and waited for her to speak again. It seemed as if
      he were in the presence of a mysterious Fate rather than of the longed-for
      mother. He was beginning to watch her with wonder, from the spiritual
      distance to which she had thrown him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she began: &ldquo;I did not send for you to comfort me.
      I could not know beforehand&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know now&mdash;what you
      will feel toward me. I have not the foolish notion that you can love me
      merely because I am your mother, when you have never seen or heard of me
      in all your life. But I thought I chose something better for you than
      being with me. I did not think I deprived you of anything worth having.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot wish me to believe that your affection would not have
      been worth having,&rdquo; said Deronda, finding that she paused as if she
      expected him to make some answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to speak ill of myself,&rdquo; said the
      princess, with proud impetuosity, &ldquo;But I had not much affection to
      give you. I did not want affection. I had been stifled with it. I wanted
      to live out the life that was in me, and not to be hampered with other
      lives. You wonder what I was. I was no princess then.&rdquo; She rose with
      a sudden movement, and stood as she had done before. Deronda immediately
      rose too; he felt breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No princess in this tame life that I live in now. I was a great
      singer, and I acted as well as I sang. All the rest were poor beside me.
      Men followed me from one country to another. I was living a myriad lives
      in one. I did not want a child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a passionate self-defence in her tone. She had cast all
      precedent out of her mind. Precedent had no excuse for her and she could
      only seek a justification in the intensest words she could find for her
      experience. She seemed to fling out the last words against some possible
      reproach in the mind of her son, who had to stand and hear them&mdash;clutching
      his coat-collar as if he were keeping himself above water by it, and
      feeling his blood in the sort of commotion that might have been excited if
      he had seen her going through some strange rite of a religion which gave a
      sacredness to crime. What else had she to tell him? She went on with the
      same intensity and a sort of pale illumination in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not want to marry. I was forced into marrying your father&mdash;forced,
      I mean, by my father&rsquo;s wishes and commands; and besides, it was my
      best way of getting some freedom. I could rule my husband, but not my
      father. I had a right to be free. I had a right to seek my freedom from a
      bondage that I hated.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She seated herself again, while there was that subtle movement in her eyes
      and closed lips which is like the suppressed continuation of speech.
      Deronda continued standing, and after a moment or two she looked up at him
      with a less defiant pleading as she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the bondage I hated for myself I wanted to keep you from. What
      better could the most loving mother have done? I relieved you from the
      bondage of having been born a Jew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I <i>am</i> a Jew?&rdquo; Deronda burst out with a deep-voiced
      energy that made his mother shrink a little backward against her cushions.
      &ldquo;My father was a Jew, and you are a Jewess?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your father was my cousin,&rdquo; said the mother, watching
      him with a change in her look, as if she saw something that she might have
      to be afraid of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of it,&rdquo; said Deronda, impetuously, in the veiled
      voice of passion. He could not have imagined beforehand how he would have
      come to say that which he had never hitherto admitted. He could not have
      dreamed that it would be in impulsive opposition to his mother. He was
      shaken by a mixed anger which no reflection could come soon enough to
      check, against this mother who it seemed had borne him unwillingly, had
      willingly made herself a stranger to him, and&mdash;perhaps&mdash;was now
      making herself known unwillingly. This last suspicion seemed to flash some
      explanation over her speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the mother was equally shaken by an anger differently mixed, and her
      frame was less equal to any repression. The shaking with her was visibly
      physical, and her eyes looked the larger for her pallid excitement as she
      said violently,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say you are glad? You are an English gentleman. I
      secured you that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not know what you secured me. How could you choose my
      birthright for me?&rdquo; said Deronda, throwing himself sideways into his
      chair again, almost unconsciously, and leaning his arm over the back,
      while he looked away from his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was fired with an intolerance that seemed foreign to him. But he was
      now trying hard to master himself and keep silence. A horror had swept in
      upon his anger lest he should say something too hard in this moment which
      made an epoch never to be recalled. There was a pause before his mother
      spoke again, and when she spoke her voice had become more firmly resistant
      in its finely varied tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I chose for you what I would have chosen for myself. How could I
      know that you would have the spirit of my father in you? How could I know
      that you would love what I hated?&mdash;if you really love to be a Jew.&rdquo;
      The last words had such bitterness in them that any one overhearing might
      have supposed some hatred had arisen between the mother and son.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Deronda had recovered his fuller self. He was recalling his
      sensibilities to what life had been and actually was for her whose best
      years were gone, and who with the signs of suffering in her frame was now
      exerting herself to tell him of a past which was not his alone but also
      hers. His habitual shame at the acceptance of events as if they were his
      only, helped him even here. As he looked at his mother silently after her
      last words, his face regained some of its penetrative calm; yet it seemed
      to have a strangely agitating influence over her: her eyes were fixed on
      him with a sort of fascination, but not with any repose of maternal
      delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, if I speak hastily,&rdquo; he said, with diffident
      gravity. &ldquo;Why have you resolved now on disclosing to me what you
      took care to have me brought up in ignorance of? Why&mdash;since you seem
      angry that I should be glad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;the reasons of our actions!&rdquo; said the Princess, with
      a ring of something like sarcastic scorn. &ldquo;When you are as old as I
      am, it will not seem so simple a question&mdash;&lsquo;Why did you do
      this?&rsquo; People talk of their motives in a cut and dried way. Every
      woman is supposed to have the same set of motives, or else to be a
      monster. I am not a monster, but I have not felt exactly what other women
      feel&mdash;or say they feel, for fear of being thought unlike others. When
      you reproach me in your heart for sending you away from me, you mean that
      I ought to say I felt about you as other women say they feel about their
      children. I did <i>not</i> feel that. I was glad to be freed from you. But
      I did well for you, and I gave you your father&rsquo;s fortune. Do I seem
      now to be revoking everything?&mdash;Well, there are reasons. I feel many
      things that I cannot understand. A fatal illness has been growing in me
      for a year. I shall very likely not live another year. I will not deny
      anything I have done. I will not pretend to love where I have no love. But
      shadows are rising round me. Sickness makes them. If I have wronged the
      dead&mdash;I have but little time to do what I left undone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The varied transitions of tone with which this speech was delivered were
      as perfect as the most accomplished actress could have made them. The
      speech was in fact a piece of what may be called sincere acting; this
      woman&rsquo;s nature was one in which all feeling&mdash;and all the more
      when it was tragic as well as real&mdash;immediately became matter of
      conscious representation: experience immediately passed into drama, and
      she acted her own emotions. In a minor degree this is nothing uncommon,
      but in the Princess the acting had a rare perfection of physiognomy,
      voice, and gesture. It would not be true to say that she felt less because
      of this double consciousness: she felt&mdash;that is, her mind went
      through&mdash;all the more, but with a difference; each nucleus of pain or
      pleasure had a deep atmosphere of the excitement or spiritual intoxication
      which at once exalts and deadens. But Deronda made no reflection of this
      kind. All his thoughts hung on the purport of what his mother was saying;
      her tones and her wonderful face entered into his agitation without being
      noted. What he longed for with an awed desire was to know as much as she
      would tell him of the strange mental conflict under which it seemed he had
      been brought into the world; what his compassionate nature made the
      controlling idea within him were the suffering and the confession that
      breathed through her later words, and these forbade any further question,
      when she paused and remained silent, with her brow knit, her head turned a
      little away from him, and her large eyes fixed as if on something
      incorporeal. He must wait for her to speak again. She did so with strange
      abruptness, turning her eyes upon him suddenly, and saying more quickly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Hugo has written much about you. He tells me you have a
      wonderful mind&mdash;you comprehend everything&mdash;you are wiser than he
      is with all his sixty years. You say you are glad to know that you were
      born a Jew. I am not going to tell you that I have changed my mind about
      that. Your feelings are against mine. You don&rsquo;t thank me for what I
      did. Shall you comprehend your mother, or only blame her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not a fibre within me but makes me wish to comprehend her,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, meeting her sharp gaze solemnly. &ldquo;It is a bitter
      reversal of my longing to think of blaming her. What I have been most
      trying to do for fifteen years is to have some understanding of those who
      differ from myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have become unlike your grandfather in that.&rdquo; said
      the mother, &ldquo;though you are a young copy of him in your face. He
      never comprehended me, or if he did, he only thought of fettering me into
      obedience. I was to be what he called &lsquo;the Jewish woman&rsquo; under
      pain of his curse. I was to feel everything I did not feel, and believe
      everything I did not believe. I was to feel awe for the bit of parchment
      in the <i>mezuza</i> over the door; to dread lest a bit of butter should
      touch a bit of meat; to think it beautiful that men should bind the <i>tephillin</i>
      on them, and women not,&mdash;to adore the wisdom of such laws, however
      silly they might seem to me. I was to love the long prayers in the ugly
      synagogue, and the howling, and the gabbling, and the dreadful fasts, and
      the tiresome feasts, and my father&rsquo;s endless discoursing about our
      people, which was a thunder without meaning in my ears. I was to care
      forever about what Israel had been; and I did not care at all. I cared for
      the wide world, and all that I could represent in it. I hated living under
      the shadow of my father&rsquo;s strictness. Teaching, teaching for
      everlasting&mdash;&lsquo;this you must be,&rsquo; &lsquo;that you must not
      be&rsquo;&mdash;pressed on me like a frame that got tighter and tighter as
      I grew. I wanted to live a large life, with freedom to do what every one
      else did, and be carried along in a great current, not obliged to care.
      Ah!&rdquo;&mdash;here her tone changed to one of a more bitter
      incisiveness&mdash;&ldquo;you are glad to have been born a Jew. You say
      so. That is because you have not been brought up as a Jew. That
      separateness seems sweet to you because I saved you from it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you resolved on that, you meant that I should never know my
      origin?&rdquo; said Deronda, impulsively. &ldquo;You have at least changed
      in your feeling on that point.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that was what I meant. That is what I persevered in. And it is
      not true to say that I have changed. Things have changed in spite of me. I
      am still the same Leonora&rdquo;&mdash;she pointed with her forefinger to
      her breast&mdash;&ldquo;here within me is the same desire, the same will,
      the same choice, <i>but</i>&rdquo;&mdash;she spread out her hands, palm
      upward, on each side of her, as she paused with a bitter compression of
      her lip, then let her voice fall into muffled, rapid utterance&mdash;&ldquo;events
      come upon us like evil enchantments: and thoughts, feelings, apparitions
      in the darkness are events&mdash;are they not? I don&rsquo;t consent. We
      only consent to what we love. I obey something tyrannic&rdquo;&mdash;she
      spread out her hands again&mdash;&ldquo;I am forced to be withered, to
      feel pain, to be dying slowly. Do I love that? Well, I have been forced to
      obey my dead father. I have been forced to tell you that you are a Jew,
      and deliver to you what he commanded me to deliver.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beseech you to tell me what moved you&mdash;when you were young,
      I mean&mdash;to take the course you did,&rdquo; said Deronda, trying by
      this reference to the past to escape from what to him was the
      heart-rending piteousness of this mingled suffering and defiance. &ldquo;I
      gather that my grandfather opposed your bent to be an artist. Though my
      own experience has been quite different, I enter into the painfulness of
      your struggle. I can imagine the hardship of an enforced renunciation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Princess, shaking her head and folding her arms
      with an air of decision. &ldquo;You are not a woman. You may try&mdash;but
      you can never imagine what it is to have a man&rsquo;s force of genius in
      you, and yet to suffer the slavery of being a girl. To have a pattern cut
      out&mdash;&lsquo;this is the Jewish woman; this is what you must be; this
      is what you are wanted for; a woman&rsquo;s heart must be of such a size
      and no larger, else it must be pressed small, like Chinese feet; her
      happiness is to be made as cakes are, by a fixed receipt.&rsquo; That was
      what my father wanted. He wished I had been a son; he cared for me as a
      make-shift link. His heart was set on his Judaism. He hated that Jewish
      women should be thought of by the Christian world as a sort of ware to
      make public singers and actresses of. As if we were not the more enviable
      for that! That is a chance of escaping from bondage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was my grandfather a learned man?&rdquo; said Deronda, eager to
      know particulars that he feared his mother might not think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered impatiently, putting up her hand, &ldquo;Oh, yes,&mdash;and a
      clever physician&mdash;and good: I don&rsquo;t deny that he was good. A
      man to be admired in a play&mdash;grand, with an iron will. Like the old
      Foscari before he pardons. But such men turn their wives and daughters
      into slaves. They would rule the world if they could; but not ruling the
      world, they throw all the weight of their will on the necks and souls of
      women. But nature sometimes thwarts them. My father had no other child
      than his daughter, and she was like himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had folded her arms again, and looked as if she were ready to face
      some impending attempt at mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father was different. Unlike me&mdash;all lovingness and
      affection. I knew I could rule him; and I made him secretly promise me,
      before I married him, that he would put no hindrance in the way of my
      being an artist. My father was on his deathbed when we were married: from
      the first he had fixed his mind on my marrying my cousin Ephraim. And when
      a woman&rsquo;s will is as strong as the man&rsquo;s who wants to govern
      her, half her strength must be concealment. I meant to have my will in the
      end, but I could only have it by seeming to obey. I had an awe of my
      father&mdash;always I had had an awe of him: it was impossible to help it.
      I hated to feel awed&mdash;I wished I could have defied him openly; but I
      never could. It was what I could not imagine: I could not act it to myself
      that I should begin to defy my father openly and succeed. And I never
      would risk failure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This last sentence was uttered with an abrupt emphasis, and she paused
      after it as if the words had raised a crowd of remembrances which
      obstructed speech. Her son was listening to her with feelings more and
      more highly mixed; the first sense of being repelled by the frank coldness
      which had replaced all his preconceptions of a mother&rsquo;s tender joy
      in the sight of him; the first impulses of indignation at what shocked his
      most cherished emotions and principles&mdash;all these busy elements of
      collision between them were subsiding for a time, and making more and more
      room for that effort at just allowance and that admiration of a forcible
      nature whose errors lay along high pathways, which he would have felt if,
      instead of being his mother, she had been a stranger who had appealed to
      his sympathy. Still it was impossible to be dispassionate: he trembled
      lest the next thing she had to say would be more repugnant to him than
      what had gone before: he was afraid of the strange coërcion she seemed to
      be under to lay her mind bare: he almost wished he could say, &ldquo;Tell
      me only what is necessary,&rdquo; and then again he felt the fascination
      which made him watch her and listen to her eagerly. He tried to recall her
      to particulars by asking,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was my grandfather&rsquo;s home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here in Genoa, where I was married; and his family had lived here
      generations ago. But my father had been in various countries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must surely have lived in England?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother was English&mdash;a Jewess of Portuguese descent. My
      father married her in England. Certain circumstances of that marriage made
      all the difference in my life: through that marriage my father thwarted
      his own plans. My mother&rsquo;s sister was a singer, and afterward she
      married the English partner of a merchant&rsquo;s house here in Genoa, and
      they came and lived here eleven years. My mother died when I was eight
      years old, and my father allowed me to be continually with my Aunt Leonora
      and be taught under her eyes, as if he had not minded the danger of her
      encouraging my wish to be a singer, as she had been. But this was it&mdash;I
      saw it again and again in my father:&mdash;he did not guard against
      consequences, because he felt sure he could hinder them if he liked.
      Before my aunt left Genoa, I had had enough teaching to bring out the born
      singer and actress within me: my father did not know everything that was
      done; but he knew that I was taught music and singing&mdash;he knew my
      inclination. That was nothing to him: he meant that I should obey his
      will. And he was resolved that I should marry my cousin Ephraim, the only
      one left of my father&rsquo;s family that he knew. I wanted not to marry.
      I thought of all plans to resist it, but at last I found that I could rule
      my cousin, and I consented. My father died three weeks after we were
      married, and then I had my way!&rdquo; She uttered these words almost
      exultantly; but after a little pause her face changed, and she said in a
      biting tone, &ldquo;It has not lasted, though. My father is getting his
      way now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to look more contemplatively again at her son, and presently
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are like him&mdash;but milder&mdash;there is something of your
      own father in you; and he made it the labor of his life to devote himself
      to me: wound up his money-changing and banking, and lived to wait upon me&mdash;he
      went against his conscience for me. As I loved the life of my art, so he
      loved me. Let me look at your hand again: the hand with the ring on. It
      was your father&rsquo;s ring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew his chair nearer to her and gave her his hand. We know what kind
      of a hand it was: her own, very much smaller, was of the same type. As he
      felt the smaller hand holding his, as he saw nearer to him the face that
      held the likeness of his own, aged not by time but by intensity, the
      strong bent of his nature toward a reverential tenderness asserted itself
      above every other impression and in his most fervent tone he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother! take us all into your heart&mdash;the living and the dead.
      Forgive every thing that hurts you in the past. Take my affection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him admiringly rather than lovingly, then kissed him on the
      brow, and saying sadly, &ldquo;I reject nothing, but I have nothing to
      give,&rdquo; she released his hand and sank back on her cushions. Deronda
      turned pale with what seems always more of a sensation than an emotion&mdash;the
      pain of repulsed tenderness. She noticed the expression of pain, and said,
      still with melodious melancholy in her tones,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better so. We must part again soon and you owe me no duties.
      I did not wish you to be born. I parted with you willingly. When your
      father died I resolved that I would have no more ties, but such as I could
      free myself from. I was the Alcharisi you have heard of: the name had
      magic wherever it was carried. Men courted me. Sir Hugo Mallinger was one
      who wished to marry me. He was madly in love with me. One day I asked him,
      &lsquo;Is there a man capable of doing something for love of me, and
      expecting nothing in return?&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;What is it you want
      done?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Take my boy and bring him up as an Englishman,
      and never let him know anything about his parents.&rsquo; You were little
      more than two years old, and were sitting on his foot. He declared that he
      would pay money to have such a boy. I had not meditated much on the plan
      beforehand, but as soon as I had spoken about it, it took possession of me
      as something I could not rest without doing. At first he thought I was not
      serious, but I convinced him, and he was never surprised at anything. He
      agreed that it would be for your good, and the finest thing for you. A
      great singer and actress is a queen, but she gives no royalty to her son.
      All that happened at Naples. And afterward I made Sir Hugo the trustee of
      your fortune. That is what I did; and I had a joy in doing it. My father
      had tyrannized over me&mdash;he cared more about a grandson to come than
      he did about me: I counted as nothing. You were to be such a Jew as he;
      you were to be what he wanted. But you were my son, and it was my turn to
      say what you should be. I said you should not know you were a Jew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for months events have been preparing me to be glad that I am a
      Jew,&rdquo; said Deronda, his opposition roused again. The point touched
      the quick of his experience. &ldquo;It would always have been better that
      I should have known the truth. I have always been rebelling against the
      secrecy that looked like shame. It is no shame to have Jewish parents&mdash;the
      shame is to disown it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say it was a shame to me, then, that I used that secrecy,&rdquo;
      said his mother, with a flash of new anger. &ldquo;There is no shame
      attaching to me. I have no reason to be ashamed. I rid myself of the
      Jewish tatters and gibberish that make people nudge each other at sight of
      us, as if we were tattooed under our clothes, though our faces are as
      whole as theirs. I delivered you from the pelting contempt that pursues
      Jewish separateness. I am not ashamed that I did it. It was the better for
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why have you now undone the secrecy?&mdash;no, not undone it&mdash;the
      effects will never be undone. But why have you now sent for me to tell me
      that I am a Jew?&rdquo; said Deronda, with an intensity of opposition in
      feeling that was almost bitter. It seemed as if her words had called out a
      latent obstinacy of race in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&mdash;ah, why?&rdquo; said the Princess, rising quickly and
      walking to the other side of the room, where she turned round and slowly
      approached him, as he, too, stood up. Then she began to speak again in a
      more veiled voice. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain; I can only say what is. I
      don&rsquo;t love my father&rsquo;s religion now any more than I did then.
      Before I married the second time I was baptized; I made myself like the
      people I lived among. I had a right to do it; I was not like a brute,
      obliged to go with my own herd. I have not repented; I will not say that I
      have repented. But yet&rdquo;&mdash;here she had come near to her son, and
      paused; then again retreated a little and stood still, as if resolute not
      to give way utterly to an imperious influence; but, as she went on
      speaking, she became more and more unconscious of anything but the awe
      that subdued her voice. &ldquo;It is illness, I don&rsquo;t doubt that it
      has been gathering illness&mdash;my mind has gone back: more than a year
      ago it began. You see my gray hair, my worn look: it has all come fast.
      Sometimes I am in an agony of pain&mdash;I dare say I shall be to-night.
      Then it is as if all the life I have chosen to live, all thoughts, all
      will, forsook me and left me alone in spots of memory, and I can&rsquo;t
      get away: my pain seems to keep me there. My childhood&mdash;my girlhood&mdash;the
      day of my marriage&mdash;the day of my father&rsquo;s death&mdash;there
      seems to be nothing since. Then a great horror comes over me: what do I
      know of life or death? and what my father called &lsquo;right&rsquo; may
      be a power that is laying hold of me&mdash;that is clutching me now. Well,
      I will satisfy him. I cannot go into the darkness without satisfying him.
      I have hidden what was his. I thought once I would burn it. I have not
      burned it. I thank God I have not burned it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself on her cushions again, visibly fatigued. Deronda, moved
      too strongly by her suffering for other impulses to act within him, drew
      near her, and said, entreatingly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not spare yourself this evening? Let us leave the rest
      till to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said decisively. &ldquo;I will confess it all, now
      that I have come up to it. Often when I am at ease it all fades away; my
      whole self comes quite back; but I know it will sink away again, and the
      other will come&mdash;the poor, solitary, forsaken remains of self, that
      can resist nothing. It was my nature to resist, and say, &lsquo;I have a
      right to resist.&rsquo; Well, I say so still when I have any strength in
      me. You have heard me say it, and I don&rsquo;t withdraw it. But when my
      strength goes, some other right forces itself upon me like iron in an
      inexorable hand; and even when I am at ease, it is beginning to make
      ghosts upon the daylight. And now you have made it worse for me,&rdquo;
      she said, with a sudden return of impetuosity; &ldquo;but I shall have
      told you everything. And what reproach is there against me,&rdquo; she
      added bitterly, &ldquo;since I have made you glad to be a Jew? Joseph
      Kalonymos reproached me: he said you had been turned into a proud
      Englishman, who resented being touched by a Jew. I wish you had!&rdquo;
      she ended, with a new marvelous alternation. It was as if her mind were
      breaking into several, one jarring the other into impulsive action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Joseph Kalonymos?&rdquo; said Deronda, with a darting
      recollection of that Jew who touched his arm in the Frankfort synagogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! some vengeance sent him back from the East, that he might see
      you and come to reproach me. He was my father&rsquo;s friend. He knew of
      your birth: he knew of my husband&rsquo;s death, and once, twenty years
      ago, after he had been away in the Levant, he came to see me and inquire
      about you. I told him that you were dead: I meant you to be dead to all
      the world of my childhood. If I had said that you were living, he would
      have interfered with my plans: he would have taken on him to represent my
      father, and have tried to make me recall what I had done. What could I do
      but say you were dead? The act was done. If I had told him of it there
      would have been trouble and scandal&mdash;and all to conquer me, who would
      not have been conquered. I was strong then, and I would have had my will,
      though there might have been a hard fight against me. I took the way to
      have it without any fight. I felt then that I was not really deceiving: it
      would have come to the same in the end; or if not to the same, to
      something worse. He believed me and begged that I would give up to him the
      chest that my father had charged me and my husband to deliver to our
      eldest son. I knew what was in the chest&mdash;things that had been dinned
      in my ears since I had had any understanding&mdash;things that were thrust
      on my mind that I might feel them like a wall around my life&mdash;my life
      that was growing like a tree. Once, after my husband died, I was going to
      burn the chest. But it was difficult to burn; and burning a chest and
      papers looks like a shameful act. I have committed no shameful act&mdash;except
      what Jews would call shameful. I had kept the chest, and I gave it to
      Joseph Kalonymos. He went away mournful, and said, &lsquo;If you marry
      again, and if another grandson is born to him who is departed, I will
      deliver up the chest to him.&rsquo; I bowed in silence. I meant not to
      marry again&mdash;no more than I meant to be the shattered woman that I am
      now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She ceased speaking, and her head sank back while she looked vaguely
      before her. Her thought was traveling through the years, and when she
      began to speak again her voice had lost its argumentative spirit, and had
      fallen into a veiled tone of distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But months ago this Kalonymos saw you in the synagogue at
      Frankfort. He saw you enter the hotel, and he went to ask your name. There
      was nobody else in the world to whom the name would have told anything
      about me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is not my real name?&rdquo; said Deronda, with a dislike
      even to this trifling part of the disguise which had been thrown round
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as real as another,&rdquo; said his mother, indifferently.
      &ldquo;The Jews have always been changing their names. My father&rsquo;s
      family had kept the name of Charisi: my husband was a Charisi. When I came
      out as a singer, we made it Alcharisi. But there had been a branch of the
      family my father had lost sight of who called themselves Deronda, and when
      I wanted a name for you, and Sir Hugo said, &lsquo;Let it be a foreign
      name,&rsquo; I thought of Deronda. But Joseph Kalonymos had heard my
      father speak of the Deronda branch, and the name confirmed his suspicion.
      He began to suspect what had been done. It was as if everything had been
      whispered to him in the air. He found out where I was. He took a journey
      into Russia to see me; he found me weak and shattered. He had come back
      again, with his white hair, and with rage in his soul against me. He said
      I was going down to the grave clad in falsehood and robbery&mdash;falsehood
      to my father and robbery of my own child. He accused me of having kept the
      knowledge of your birth from you, and having brought you up as if you had
      been the son of an English gentleman. Well, it was true; and twenty years
      before I would have maintained that I had a right to do it. But I can
      maintain nothing now. No faith is strong within me. My father may have God
      on his side. This man&rsquo;s words were like lion&rsquo;s teeth upon me.
      My father&rsquo;s threats eat into me with my pain. If I tell everything&mdash;if
      I deliver up everything&mdash;what else can be demanded of me? I cannot
      make myself love the people I have never loved&mdash;is it not enough that
      I lost the life I did love?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had leaned forward a little in her low-toned pleading, that seemed
      like a smothered cry: her arms and hands were stretched out at full
      length, as if strained in beseeching, Deronda&rsquo;s soul was absorbed in
      the anguish of compassion. He could not mind now that he had been repulsed
      before. His pity made a flood of forgiveness within him. His single
      impulse was to kneel by her and take her hand gently, between his palms,
      while he said in that exquisite voice of soothing which expresses oneness
      with the sufferer,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, take comfort!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not seem inclined to repulse him now, but looked down at him and
      let him take both her hands to fold between his. Gradually tears gathered,
      but she pressed her handkerchief against her eyes and then leaned her
      cheek against his brow, as if she wished that they should not look at each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not possible that I could be near you often and comfort you?&rdquo;
      said Deronda. He was under that stress of pity that propels us on
      sacrifices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not possible,&rdquo; she answered, lifting up her head again
      and withdrawing her hand as if she wished him to move away. &ldquo;I have
      a husband and five children. None of them know of your existence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda felt painfully silenced. He rose and stood at a little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wonder why I married,&rdquo; she went on presently, under the
      influence of a newly-recurring thought. &ldquo;I meant never to marry
      again. I meant to be free and to live for my art. I had parted with you. I
      had no bonds. For nine years I was a queen. I enjoyed the life I had
      longed for. But something befell me. It was like a fit of forgetfulness. I
      began to sing out of tune. They told me of it. Another woman was thrusting
      herself in my place. I could not endure the prospect of failure and
      decline. It was horrible to me.&rdquo; She started up again, with a
      shudder, and lifted screening hands like one who dreads missiles. &ldquo;It
      drove me to marry. I made believe that I preferred being the wife of a
      Russian noble to being the greatest lyric actress of Europe; I made
      believe&mdash;I acted that part. It was because I felt my greatness
      sinking away from me, as I feel my life sinking now. I would not wait till
      men said, &lsquo;She had better go.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank into her seat again, and looked at the evening sky as she went
      on: &ldquo;I repented. It was a resolve taken in desperation. That singing
      out of tune was only like a fit of illness; it went away. I repented; but
      it was too late. I could not go back. All things hindered, me&mdash;all
      things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A new haggardness had come in her face, but her son refrained from again
      urging her to leave further speech till the morrow: there was evidently
      some mental relief for her in an outpouring such as she could never have
      allowed herself before. He stood still while she maintained silence longer
      than she knew, and the light was perceptibly fading. At last she turned to
      him and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can bear no more now.&rdquo; She put out her hand, but then
      quickly withdrew it saying, &ldquo;Stay. How do I know that I can see you
      again? I cannot bear to be seen when I am in pain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew forth a pocket-book, and taking out a letter said, &ldquo;This is
      addressed to the banking-house in Mainz, where you are to go for your
      grandfather&rsquo;s chest. It is a letter written by Joseph Kalonymos: if
      he is not there himself, this order of his will be obeyed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Deronda had taken the letter, she said, with effort but more gently
      than before, &ldquo;Kneel again, and let me kiss you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed, and holding his head between her hands, she kissed him solemnly
      on the brow. &ldquo;You see, I had no life left to love you with,&rdquo;
      she said, in a low murmur. &ldquo;But there is more fortune for you. Sir
      Hugo was to keep it in reserve. I gave you all your father&rsquo;s
      fortune. They can never accuse me of robbery there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had needed anything I would have worked for you,&rdquo; said
      Deronda, conscious of disappointed yearning&mdash;a shutting out forever

      &ldquo;I need nothing that the skill of man can give me,&rdquo; said his
      mother, still holding his head, and perusing his features. &ldquo;But
      perhaps now I have satisfied my father&rsquo;s will, your face will come
      instead of his&mdash;your young, loving face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will see me again?&rdquo; said Deronda, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;perhaps. Wait, wait. Leave me now.&rdquo;

    &ldquo;La même fermeté qui sert à résister à l&rsquo;amour sert aussi à le rendre

      Among Deronda&rsquo;s letters the next morning was one from Hans Meyrick
      of four quarto pages, in the small, beautiful handwriting which ran in the
      Meyrick family.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    MY DEAR DERONDA,&mdash;In return for your sketch of Italian movements and
    your view of the world&rsquo;s affairs generally, I may say that here at
    home the most judicious opinion going as to the effects of present
    causes is that &ldquo;time will show.&rdquo; As to the present causes of past
    effects, it is now seen that the late swindling telegrams account for
    the last year&rsquo;s cattle plague&mdash;which is a refutation of philosophy
    falsely so called, and justifies the compensation to the farmers. My
    own idea that a murrain will shortly break out in the commercial
    class, and that the cause will subsequently disclose itself in the
    ready sale of all rejected pictures, has been called an unsound use of
    analogy; but there are minds that will not hesitate to rob even the
    neglected painter of his solace. To my feeling there is great beauty
    in the conception that some bad judge might give a high price for my
    Berenice series, and that the men in the city would have already been
    punished for my ill-merited luck.

    Meanwhile I am consoling myself for your absence by finding my
    advantage in it&mdash;shining like Hesperus when Hyperion has departed;
    sitting with our Hebrew prophet, and making a study of his head, in
    the hours when he used to be occupied with you&mdash;getting credit with
    him as a learned young Gentile, who would have been a Jew if he could
    &mdash;and agreeing with him in the general principle, that whatever is
    best is for that reason Jewish. I never held it my <i>forte</i> to be
    a severe reasoner, but I can see that if whatever is best is A, and B
    happens to be best, B must be A, however little you might have
    expected it beforehand. On that principle I could see the force of a
    pamphlet I once read to prove that all good art was Protestant.
    However, our prophet is an uncommonly interesting sitter&mdash;a better
    model than Rembrandt had for his Rabbi&mdash;and I never come away from him
    without a new discovery. For one thing, it is a constant wonder to me
    that, with all his fiery feeling for his race and their traditions, he
    is no straight-laced Jew, spitting after the word Christian, and
    enjoying the prospect that the Gentile mouth will water in vain for a
    slice of the roasted Leviathan, while Israel will be sending up plates
    for more, <i>ad libitum</i>, (You perceive that my studies had taught
    me what to expect from the orthodox Jew.) I confess that I have always
    held lightly by your account of Mordecai, as apologetic, and merely
    part of your disposition to make an antedeluvian point of view lest
    you should do injustice to the megatherium. But now I have given ear
    to him in his proper person, I find him really a sort of
    philosophical-allegorical-mystical believer, and yet with a sharp
    dialectic point, so that any argumentative rattler of peas in a
    bladder might soon be pricked in silence by him. The mixture may be
    one of the Jewish prerogatives, for what I know. In fact, his mind
    seems so broad that I find my own correct opinions lying in it quite
    commodiously, and how they are to be brought into agreement with the
    vast remainder is his affair, not mine. I leave it to him to settle
    our basis, never yet having seen a basis which is not a
    world-supporting elephant, more or less powerful and expensive to keep.
    My means will not allow me to keep a private elephant. I go into mystery
    instead, as cheaper and more lasting&mdash;a sort of gas which is likely to
    be continually supplied by the decomposition of the elephants. And if
    I like the look of an opinion, I treat it civilly, without suspicious
    inquiries. I have quite a friendly feeling toward Mordecai&rsquo;s notion
    that a whole Christian is three-fourths a Jew, and that from the
    Alexandrian time downward the most comprehensive minds have been
    Jewish; for I think of pointing out to Mirah that, Arabic and other
    incidents of life apart, there is really little difference between me
    and&mdash;Maimonides. But I have lately been finding out that it is your
    shallow lover who can&rsquo;t help making a declaration. If Mirah&rsquo;s ways
    were less distracting, and it were less of a heaven to be in her
    presence and watch her, I must long ago have flung myself at her feet,
    and requested her to tell me, with less indirectness, whether she
    wished me to blow my brains out. I have a knack of hoping, which is as
    good as an estate in reversion, if one can keep from the temptation of
    turning it into certainty, which may spoil all. My Hope wanders among
    the orchard blossoms, feels the warm snow falling on it through the
    sunshine, and is in doubt of nothing; but, catching sight of Certainty
    in the distance, sees an ugly Janus-faced deity, with a dubious wink
    on the hither side of him, and turns quickly away. But you, with your
    supreme reasonableness, and self-nullification, and preparation for
    the worst&mdash;you know nothing about Hope, that immortal, delicious
    maiden forever courted forever propitious, whom fools have called
    deceitful, as if it were Hope that carried the cup of disappointment,
    whereas it is her deadly enemy, Certainty, whom she only escapes by
    transformation. (You observe my new vein of allegory?) Seriously,
    however, I must be permitted to allege that truth will prevail, that
    prejudice will melt before it, that diversity, accompanied by merit,
    will make itself felt as fascination, and that no virtuous aspiration
    will be frustrated&mdash;all which, if I mistake not, are doctrines of the
    schools, and they imply that the Jewess I prefer will prefer me. Any
    blockhead can cite generalities, but the mind-master discerns the
    particular cases they represent.

    I am less convinced that my society makes amends to Mordecai for your
    absence, but another substitute occasionally comes in the form of
    Jacob Cohen. It is worth while to catch our prophet&rsquo;s expression when
    he has that remarkable type of young Israel on his knee, and pours
    forth some Semitic inspiration with a sublime look of melancholy
    patience and devoutness. Sometimes it occurs to Jacob that Hebrew will
    be more edifying to him if he stops his ears with his palms, and
    imitates the venerable sounds as heard through that muffled medium.
    When Mordecai gently draws down the little fists and holds them fast,
    Jacob&rsquo;s features all take on an extraordinary activity, very much as
    if he was walking through a menagerie and trying to imitate every
    animal in turn, succeeding best with the owl and the peccary. But I
    dare say you have seen something of this. He treats me with the
    easiest familiarity, and seems in general to look at me as a second-hand
    Christian commodity, likely to come down in price; remarking on
    my disadvantages with a frankness which seems to imply some thoughts
    of future purchase. It is pretty, though, to see the change in him if
    Mirah happens to come in. He turns child suddenly&mdash;his age usually
    strikes one as being like the Israelitish garments in the desert,
    perhaps near forty, yet with an air of recent production. But, with
    Mirah, he reminds me of the dogs that have been brought up by women,
    and remain manageable by them only. Still, the dog is fond of Mordecai
    too, and brings sugar-plums to share with him, filling his own mouth
    to rather an embarrassing extent, and watching how Mordecai deals with
    a smaller supply. Judging from this modern Jacob at the age of six, my
    astonishment is that his race has not bought us all up long ago, and
    pocketed our feebler generations in the form of stock and scrip, as so
    much slave property. There is one Jewess I should not mind being slave
    to. But I wish I did not imagine that Mirah gets a little sadder, and
    tries all the while to hide it. It is natural enough, of course, while
    she has to watch the slow death of this brother, whom she has taken to
    worshipping with such looks of loving devoutness that I am ready to
    wish myself in his place.

    For the rest, we are a little merrier than usual. Rex Gascoigne&mdash;you
    remember a head you admired among my sketches, a fellow with a good
    upper lip, reading law&mdash;has got some rooms in town now not far off us,
    and has had a neat sister (upper lip also good) staying with him the
    last fortnight. I have introduced them both to my mother and the
    girls, who have found out from Miss Gascoigne that she is cousin to
    your Vandyke duchess!!! I put the notes of exclamation to mark the
    surprise that the information at first produced on my feeble
    understanding. On reflection I discovered that there was not the least
    ground for surprise, unless I had beforehand believed that nobody
    could be anybody&rsquo;s cousin without my knowing it. This sort of
    surprise, I take it, depends on a liveliness of the spine, with a more
    or less constant nullity of brain. There was a fellow I used to meet
    at Rome who was in an effervescence of surprise at contact with the
    simplest information. Tell him what you would&mdash;that you were fond of
    easy boots&mdash;he would always say, &ldquo;No! are you?&rdquo; with the same energy
    of wonder: the very fellow of whom pastoral Browne wrote
    prophetically,

      &ldquo;A wretch so empty that if e&rsquo;er there be
      In nature found the least vacuity
      &lsquo;Twill be in him.&rdquo;

    I have accounted for it all&mdash;he had a lively spine.

    However, this cousinship with the duchess came out by chance one day
    that Mirah was with them at home and they were talking about the
    Mallingers. <i>Apropos</i>; I am getting so important that I have
    rival invitations. Gascoigne wants me to go down with him to his
    father&rsquo;s rectory in August and see the country round there. But I
    think self-interest well understood will take me to Topping Abbey, for
    Sir Hugo has invited me, and proposes&mdash;God bless him for his rashness!
    &mdash;that I should make a picture of his three daughters sitting on a
    bank&mdash;as he says, in the Gainsborough style. He came to my studio the
    other day and recommended me to apply myself to portrait. Of course I
    know what that means.&mdash;&ldquo;My good fellow, your attempts at the historic
    and poetic are simply pitiable. Your brush is just that of a
    successful portrait-painter&mdash;it has a little truth and a great
    facility in falsehood&mdash;your idealism will never do for gods and
    goddesses and heroic story, but it may fetch a high price as flattery.
    Fate, my friend, has made you the hinder wheel&mdash;<i>rota  posterior
    curras, et in axe secundo</i>&mdash;run behind, because you can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
     &mdash;What great effort it evidently costs our friends to give us these
    candid opinions! I have even known a man to take the trouble to call,
    in order to tell me that I had irretrievably exposed my want of
    judgment in treating my subject, and that if I had asked him we would
    have lent me his own judgment. Such was my ingratitude and my
    readiness at composition, that even while he was speaking I inwardly
    sketched a Last Judgment with that candid friend&rsquo;s physiognomy on the
    left. But all this is away from Sir Hugo, whose manner of implying
    that one&rsquo;s gifts are not of the highest order is so exceedingly
    good-natured and comfortable that I begin to feel it an advantage not
    to be among those poor fellows at the tip-top. And his kindness to me
    tastes all the better because it comes out of his love for you, old
    boy. His chat is uncommonly amusing. By the way, he told me that your
    Vandyke duchess is gone with her husband yachting to the Mediterranean.
    I bethink me that it is possible to land from a yacht, or to be taken
    on to a yacht from the land. Shall you by chance have an opportunity of
    continuing your theological discussion with the fair Supralapsarian&mdash;I
    think you said her tenets were of that complexion? Is Duke Alphonso
    also theological?&mdash;perhaps an Arian who objects to triplicity. (Stage
    direction. While D. is reading, a profound scorn gathers in his face
    till at the last word he flings down the letter, grasps his coat-collar
    in a statuesque attitude and so remains with a look generally
    tremendous, throughout the following soliloquy, &ldquo;O night, O blackness,
    etc., etc.&rdquo;)

    Excuse the brevity of this letter. You are not used to more from me
    than a bare statement of facts, without comment or digression. One
    fact I have omitted&mdash;that the Klesmers on the eve of departure have
    behaved magnificently, shining forth as might be expected from the
    planets of genius and fortune in conjunction. Mirah is rich with their
    oriental gifts.

    What luck it will be if you come back and present yourself at the
    Abbey while I am there! I am going to behave with consummate
    discretion and win golden opinions, But I shall run up to town now and
    then, just for a peep into Gad Eden. You see how far I have got in
    Hebrew lore&mdash;up with my Lord Bolingbroke, who knew no Hebrew, but
    &ldquo;understood that sort of learning and what is writ about it.&rdquo; If Mirah
    commanded, I would go to a depth below the tri-literal roots. Already
    it makes no difference to me whether the points are there or not. But
    while her brother&rsquo;s life lasts I suspect she would not listen to a
    lover, even one whose &ldquo;hair is like a flock of goats on Mount
    Gilead&rdquo;&mdash;and I flatter myself that few heads would bear that trying
    comparison better than mine. So I stay with my hope among the
    orchard-blossoms.

    Your devoted,

    HANS MEYRICK.
</pre>
    <p>
      Some months before, this letter from Hans would have divided Deronda&rsquo;s
      thoughts irritatingly: its romancing, about Mirah would have had an
      unpleasant edge, scarcely anointed with any commiseration for his friend&rsquo;s
      probable disappointment. But things had altered since March. Mirah was no
      longer so critically placed with regard to the Meyricks, and Deronda&rsquo;s
      own position had been undergoing a change which had just been crowned by
      the revelation of his birth. The new opening toward the future, though he
      would not trust in any definite visions, inevitably shed new lights, and
      influenced his mood toward past and present; hence, what Hans called his
      hope now seemed to Deronda, not a mischievous unreasonableness which
      roused his indignation, but an unusually persistent bird-dance of an
      extravagant fancy, and he would have felt quite able to pity any
      consequent suffering of his friend&rsquo;s, if he had believed in the
      suffering as probable. But some of the busy thought filling that long day,
      which passed without his receiving any new summons from his mother, was
      given to the argument that Hans Meyrick&rsquo;s nature was not one in
      which love could strike the deep roots that turn disappointment into
      sorrow: it was too restless, too readily excitable by novelty, too ready
      to turn itself into imaginative material, and wear its grief as a
      fantastic costume. &ldquo;Already he is beginning to play at love: he is
      taking the whole affair as a comedy,&rdquo; said Deronda to himself;
      &ldquo;he knows very well that there is no chance for him. Just like him&mdash;never
      opening his eyes on any possible objection I could have to receive his
      outpourings about Mirah. Poor old Hans! If we were under a fiery hail
      together he would howl like a Greek, and if I did not howl too it would
      never occur to him that I was as badly off as he. And yet he is
      tender-hearted and affectionate in intention, and I can&rsquo;t say that
      he is not active in imagining what goes on in other people&mdash;but then
      he always imagines it to fit his own inclination.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this touch of causticity Deronda got rid of the slight heat at
      present raised by Hans&rsquo;s naive expansiveness. The nonsense about
      Gwendolen, conveying the fact that she was gone yachting with her husband,
      only suggested a disturbing sequel to his own strange parting with her.
      But there was one sentence in the letter which raised a more immediate,
      active anxiety. Hans&rsquo;s suspicion of a hidden sadness in Mirah was
      not in the direction of his wishes, and hence, instead of distrusting his
      observation here, Deronda began to conceive a cause for the sadness. Was
      it some event that had occurred during his absence, or only the growing
      fear of some event? Was it something, perhaps alterable, in the new
      position which had been made for her? Or&mdash;had Mordecai, against his
      habitual resolve, communicated to her those peculiar cherished hopes about
      him, Deronda, and had her quickly sensitive nature been hurt by the
      discovery that her brother&rsquo;s will or tenacity of visionary
      conviction had acted coercively on their friendship&mdash;been hurt by the
      fear that there was more of pitying self-suppression than of equal regard
      in Deronda&rsquo;s relation to him? For amidst all Mirah&rsquo;s quiet
      renunciation, the evident thirst of soul with which she received the
      tribute of equality implied a corresponding pain if she found that what
      she had taken for a purely reverential regard toward her brother had its
      mixture of condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this last conjecture of Deronda&rsquo;s he was not wrong as to the
      quality in Mirah&rsquo;s nature on which he was founding&mdash;the latent
      protest against the treatment she had all her life being subject to until
      she met him. For that gratitude which would not let her pass by any notice
      of their acquaintance without insisting on the depth of her debt to him,
      took half its fervor from the keen comparison with what others had thought
      enough to render to her. Deronda&rsquo;s affinity in feeling enabled him
      to penetrate such secrets. But he was not near the truth in admitting the
      idea that Mordecai had broken his characteristic reticence. To no soul but
      Deronda himself had he yet breathed the history of their relation to each
      other, or his confidence about his friend&rsquo;s origin: it was not only
      that these subjects were for him too sacred to be spoken of without
      weighty reason, but that he had discerned Deronda&rsquo;s shrinking at any
      mention of his birth; and the severity of reserve which had hindered
      Mordecai from answering a question on a private affair of the Cohen family
      told yet more strongly here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ezra, how is it?&rdquo; Mirah one day said to him&mdash;&ldquo;I am
      continually going to speak to Mr. Deronda as if he were a Jew?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her quietly, and said, &ldquo;I suppose it is because he
      treats us as if he were our brother. But he loves not to have the
      difference of birth dwelt upon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never lived with his parents, Mr. Hans, says,&rdquo;
      continued Mirah, to whom this was necessarily a question of interest about
      every one for whom she had a regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seek not to know such things from Mr. Hans,&rdquo; said Mordecai,
      gravely, laying his hand on her curls, as he was wont. &ldquo;What Daniel
      Deronda wishes us to know about himself is for him to tell us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mirah felt herself rebuked, as Deronda had done. But to be rebuked in
      this way by Mordecai made her rather proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no one so great as my brother,&rdquo; she said to Mrs.
      Meyrick one day that she called at the Chelsea house on her way home, and,
      according to her hope, found the little mother alone. &ldquo;It is
      difficult to think that he belongs to the same world as those people I
      used to live amongst. I told you once that they made life seem like a
      madhouse; but when I am with Ezra he makes me feel that his life is a
      great good, though he has suffered so much; not like me, who wanted to die
      because I had suffered a little, and only for a little while. His soul is
      so full, it is impossible for him to wish for death as I did. I get the
      same sort of feeling from him that I got yesterday, when I was tired, and
      came home through the park after the sweet rain had fallen and the
      sunshine lay on the grass and flowers. Everything in the sky and under the
      sky looked so pure and beautiful that the weariness and trouble and folly
      seemed only a small part of what is, and I became more patient and
      hopeful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A dove-like note of melancholy in this speech caused Mrs. Meyrick to look
      at Mirah with new examination. After laying down her hat and pushing her
      curls flat, with an air of fatigue, she placed herself on a chair opposite
      her friend in her habitual attitude, her feet and hands just crossed; and
      at a distance she might have seemed a colored statue of serenity. But Mrs.
      Meyrick discerned a new look of suppressed suffering in her face, which
      corresponded to the hint that to be patient and hopeful required some
      extra influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any fresh trouble on your mind, my dear?&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Meyrick, giving up her needlework as a sign of concentrated attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah hesitated before she said, &ldquo;I am too ready to speak of
      troubles, I think. It seems unkind to put anything painful into other
      people&rsquo;s minds, unless one were sure it would hinder something
      worse. And perhaps I am too hasty and fearful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, mothers are made to like pain and trouble for the sake
      of their children. Is it because the singing lessons are so few, and are
      likely to fall off when the season comes to an end? Success in these
      things can&rsquo;t come all at once.&rdquo; Mrs. Meyrick did not believe
      that she was touching the real grief; but a guess that could be corrected
      would make an easier channel for confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that,&rdquo; said Mirah, shaking her head gently. &ldquo;I
      have been a little disappointed because so many ladies said they wanted me
      to give them or their daughters lessons, and then I never heard of them
      again, But perhaps after the holidays I shall teach in some schools.
      Besides, you know, I am as rich as a princess now. I have not touched the
      hundred pounds that Mrs. Klesmer gave me; and I should never be afraid
      that Ezra would be in want of anything, because there is Mr. Deronda,&rdquo;
      and he said, &lsquo;It is the chief honor of my life that your brother
      will share anything with me.&rsquo; Oh, no! Ezra and I can have no fears
      for each other about such things as food and clothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is some other fear on your mind,&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick
      not without divination&mdash;&ldquo;a fear of something that may disturb
      your peace. Don&rsquo;t be forecasting evil, dear child, unless it is what
      you can guard against. Anxiety is good for nothing if we can&rsquo;t turn
      it into a defense. But there&rsquo;s no defense against all the things
      that might be. Have you any more reason for being anxious now than you had
      a month ago?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; said Mirah. &ldquo;I have kept it from Ezra. I
      have not dared to tell him. Pray forgive me that I can&rsquo;t do without
      telling you. I <i>have</i> more reason for being anxious. It is five days
      ago now. I am quite sure I saw my father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Meyrick shrank into a smaller space, packing her arms across her
      chest and leaning forward&mdash;to hinder herself from pelting that father
      with her worst epithets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The year has changed him,&rdquo; Mirah went on. &ldquo;He had
      already been much altered and worn in the time before I left him. You
      remember I said how he used sometimes to cry. He was always excited one
      way or the other. I have told Ezra everything that I told you, and he says
      that my father had taken to gambling, which makes people easily
      distressed, and then again exalted. And now&mdash;it was only a moment
      that I saw him&mdash;his face was more haggard, and his clothes were
      shabby. He was with a much worse-looking man, who carried something, and
      they were hurrying along after an omnibus.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, child, he did not see you, I hope?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I had just come from Mrs. Raymond&rsquo;s, and I was waiting to
      cross near the Marble Arch. Soon he was on the omnibus and gone out of
      sight. It was a dreadful moment. My old life seemed to have come back
      again, and it was worse than it had ever been before. And I could not help
      feeling it a new deliverance that he was gone out of sight without knowing
      that I was there. And yet it hurt me that I was feeling so&mdash;it seemed
      hateful in me&mdash;almost like words I once had to speak in a play, that
      &lsquo;I had warmed my hands in the blood of my kindred.&rsquo; For where
      might my father be going? What may become of him? And his having a
      daughter who would own him in spite of all, might have hindered the worst.
      Is there any pain like seeing what ought to be the best things in life
      turned into the worst? All those opposite feelings were meeting and
      pressing against each other, and took up all my strength. No one could act
      that. Acting is slow and poor to what we go through within. I don&rsquo;t
      know how I called a cab. I only remember that I was in it when I began to
      think, &lsquo;I cannot tell Ezra; he must not know.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are afraid of grieving him?&rdquo; Mrs. Meyrick asked, when
      Mirah had paused a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and there is something more,&rdquo; said Mirah,
      hesitatingly, as if she were examining her feeling before she would
      venture to speak of it. &ldquo;I want to tell you; I cannot tell any one
      else. I could not have told my own mother: I should have closed it up
      before her. I feel shame for my father, and it is perhaps strange&mdash;but
      the shame is greater before Ezra than before any one else in the world. He
      desired me to tell him all about my life, and I obeyed him. But it is
      always like a smart to me to know that those things about my father are in
      Ezra&rsquo;s mind. And&mdash;can you believe it? when the thought haunts
      me how it would be if my father were to come and show himself before us
      both, what seems as if it would scorch me most is seeing my father
      shrinking before Ezra. That is the truth. I don&rsquo;t know whether it is
      a right feeling. But I can&rsquo;t help thinking that I would rather try
      to maintain my father in secret, and bear a great deal in that way, if I
      could hinder him from meeting my brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not encourage that feeling, Mirah,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Meyrick, hastily. &ldquo;It would be very dangerous; it would be wrong.
      You must not have concealment of that sort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ought I now to tell Ezra that I have seen my father?&rdquo;
      said Mirah, with deprecation in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mrs. Meyrick answered, dubitatively. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know that it is necessary to do that. Your father may go away with the
      birds. It is not clear that he came after you; you may never see him
      again. And then your brother will have been spared a useless anxiety. But
      promise me that if your father sees you&mdash;gets hold of you in any way
      again&mdash;and you will let us all know. Promise me that solemnly, Mirah.
      I have a right to ask it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah reflected a little, then leaned forward to put her hands in Mrs.
      Meyrick&rsquo;s, and said, &ldquo;Since you ask it, I do promise. I will
      bear this feeling of shame. I have been so long used to think that I must
      bear that sort of inward pain. But the shame for my father burns me more
      when I think of his meeting Ezra.&rdquo; She was silent a moment or two,
      and then said, in a new tone of yearning compassion, &ldquo;And we are his
      children&mdash;and he was once young like us&mdash;and my mother loved
      him. Oh! I cannot help seeing it all close, and it hurts me like a
      cruelty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah shed no tears: the discipline of her whole life had been against
      indulgence in such manifestation, which soon falls under the control of
      strong motives; but it seemed that the more intense expression of sorrow
      had entered into her voice. Mrs. Meyrick, with all her quickness and
      loving insight, did not quite understand that filial feeling in Mirah
      which had active roots deep below her indignation for the worst offenses.
      She could conceive that a mother would have a clinging pity and shame for
      a reprobate son, but she was out of patience with what she held an
      exaggerated susceptibility on behalf of this father, whose reappearance
      inclined her to wish him under the care of a turnkey. Mirah&rsquo;s
      promise, however, was some security against her weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      That incident was the only reason that Mirah herself could have stated for
      the hidden sadness which Hans had divined. Of one element in her changed
      mood she could have given no definite account: it was something as dim as
      the sense of approaching weather-change, and had extremely slight external
      promptings, such as we are often ashamed to find all we can allege in
      support of the busy constructions that go on within us, not only without
      effort, but even against it, under the influence of any blind emotional
      stirring. Perhaps the first leaven of uneasiness was laid by Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      behavior on that visit which was entirely superfluous as a means of
      engaging Mirah to sing, and could have no other motive than the excited
      and strange questioning about Deronda. Mirah had instinctively kept the
      visit a secret, but the active remembrance of it had raised a new
      susceptibility in her, and made her alive as she had never been before to
      the relations Deronda must have with that society which she herself was
      getting frequent glimpses of without belonging to it. Her peculiar life
      and education had produced in her an extraordinary mixture of
      unworldliness, with knowledge of the world&rsquo;s evil, and even this
      knowledge was a strange blending of direct observation with the effects of
      reading and theatrical study. Her memory was furnished with abundant
      passionate situation and intrigue, which she never made emotionally her
      own, but felt a repelled aloofness from, as she had done from the actual
      life around her. Some of that imaginative knowledge began now to weave
      itself around Mrs. Grandcourt; and though Mirah would admit no position
      likely to affect her reverence for Deronda, she could not avoid a new
      painfully vivid association of his general life with a world away from her
      own, where there might be some involvement of his feeling and action with
      a woman like Gwendolen, who was increasingly repugnant to her&mdash;increasingly,
      even after she had ceased to see her; for liking and disliking can grow in
      meditation as fast as in the more immediate kind of presence. Any
      disquietude consciously due to the idea that Deronda&rsquo;s deepest care
      might be for something remote not only from herself but even from his
      friendship for her brother, she would have checked with rebuking
      questions:&mdash;What was she but one who had shared his generous kindness
      with many others? and his attachment to her brother, was it not begun late
      to be soon ended? Other ties had come before, and others would remain
      after this had been cut by swift-coming death. But her uneasiness had not
      reached that point of self-recognition in which she would have been
      ashamed of it as an indirect, presumptuous claim on Deronda&rsquo;s
      feeling. That she or any one else should think of him as her possible
      lover was a conception which had never entered her mind; indeed it was
      equally out of the question with Mrs. Meyrick and the girls, who with
      Mirah herself regarded his intervention in her life as something
      exceptional, and were so impressed by his mission as her deliverer and
      guardian that they would have held it an offense to him at his holding any
      other relation toward her: a point of view which Hans also had readily
      adopted. It is a little hard upon some men that they appear to sink for us
      in becoming lovers. But precisely to this innocence of the Meyricks was
      owing the disturbance of Mirah&rsquo;s unconsciousness. The first occasion
      could hardly have been more trivial, but it prepared her emotive nature
      for a deeper effect from what happened afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when Anna Gascoigne, visiting the Meyricks; was led to speak of her
      cousinship with Gwendolen. The visit had been arranged that Anna might see
      Mirah; the three girls were at home with their mother, and there was
      naturally a flux of talk among six feminine creatures, free from the
      presence of a distorting male standard. Anna Gascoigne felt herself much
      at home with the Meyrick girls, who knew what it was to have a brother,
      and to be generally regarded as of minor importance in the world; and she
      had told Rex that she thought the University very nice, because brothers
      made friends there whose families were not rich and grand, and yet (like
      the University) were very nice. The Meyricks seemed to her almost
      alarmingly clever, and she consulted them much on the best mode of
      teaching Lotta, confiding to them that she herself was the least clever of
      her family. Mirah had lately come in, and there was a complete bouquet of
      young faces around the tea-table&mdash;Hafiz, seated a little aloft with
      large eyes on the alert, regarding the whole scene as an apparatus for
      supplying his allowance of milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of our surprise, Mirah,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;We were
      speaking of Mr. Deronda and the Mallingers, and it turns out that Miss
      Gascoigne knows them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only knew about them,&rdquo; said Anna, a little flushed with
      excitement, what she had heard and now saw of the lovely Jewess being an
      almost startling novelty to her. &ldquo;I have not even seen them. But
      some months ago, my cousin married Sir Hugo Mallinger&rsquo;s nephew, Mr.
      Grandcourt, who lived in Sir Hugo&rsquo;s place at Diplow, near us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Mab, clasping her hands. &ldquo;Something
      must come of that. Mrs. Grandcourt, the Vandyke duchess, is your cousin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I was her bridesmaid,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;Her mamma
      and mine are sisters. My aunt was much richer before last year, but then
      she and mamma lost all their fortune. Papa is a clergyman, you know, so it
      makes very little difference to us, except that we keep no carriage, and
      have no dinner parties&mdash;and I like it better. But it was very sad for
      poor Aunt Davilow, for she could not live with us, because she has four
      daughters besides Gwendolen; but then, when she married Mr. Grandcourt, it
      did not signify so much, because of his being so rich.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this finding out relationships is delightful!&rdquo; said Mab.
      &ldquo;It is like a Chinese puzzle that one has to fit together. I feel
      sure something wonderful may be made of it, but I can&rsquo;t tell what.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, Mab,&rdquo; said Amy, &ldquo;relationships must branch
      out. The only difference is, that we happen to know some of the people
      concerned. Such things are going on every day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray, Amy, why do you insist on the number nine being so
      wonderful?&rdquo; said Mab. &ldquo;I am sure that is happening every day.
      Never mind, Miss Gascoigne; please go on. And Mr. Deronda?&mdash;have you
      never seen Mr. Deronda? You <i>must</i> bring him in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not seen him,&rdquo; said Anna; &ldquo;but he was at
      Diplow before my cousin was married, and I have heard my aunt speaking of
      him to papa. She said what you have been saying about him&mdash;only not
      so much: I mean, about Mr. Deronda living with Sir Hugo Mallinger, and
      being so nice, she thought. We talk a great deal about every one who comes
      near Pennicote, because it is so seldom there is any one new. But I
      remember, when I asked Gwendolen what she thought of Mr. Deronda, she
      said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, Anna: but I think his hair is dark.&rsquo;
      That was her droll way of answering: she was always so lively. It is
      really rather wonderful that I should come to hear so much about him, all
      through Mr. Hans knowing Rex, and then my having the pleasure of knowing
      you,&rdquo; Anna ended, looking at Mrs. Meyrick with a shy grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pleasure is on our side too; but the wonder would have been, if
      you had come to this house without hearing of Mr. Deronda&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t
      it, Mirah?&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah smiled acquiescently, but had nothing to say. A confused discontent
      took possession of her at the mingling of names and images to which she
      had been listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son calls Mrs. Grandcourt the Vandyke duchess,&rdquo; continued
      Mrs. Meyrick, turning again to Anna; &ldquo;he thinks her so striking and
      picturesque.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anna. &ldquo;Gwendolen was always so beautiful&mdash;people
      fell dreadfully in love with her. I thought it a pity, because it made
      them unhappy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you like Mr. Grandcourt, the happy lover?&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Meyrick, who, in her way, was as much interested as Mab in the hints
      she had been hearing of vicissitude in the life of a widow with daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa approved of Gwendolen&rsquo;s accepting him, and my aunt says
      he is very generous,&rdquo; said Anna, beginning with a virtuous intention
      of repressing her own sentiments; but then, unable to resist a rare
      occasion for speaking them freely, she went on&mdash;&ldquo;else I should
      have thought he was not very nice&mdash;rather proud, and not at all
      lively, like Gwendolen. I should have thought some one younger and more
      lively would have suited her better. But, perhaps, having a brother who
      seems to us better than any one makes us think worse of others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till you see Mr. Deronda,&rdquo; said Mab, nodding
      significantly. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s brother will do after him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our brothers <i>must</i> do for people&rsquo;s husbands,&rdquo;
      said Kate, curtly, &ldquo;because they will not get Mr. Deronda. No woman
      will do for him to marry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No woman ought to want him to marry him,&rdquo; said Mab, with
      indignation. &ldquo;<i>I</i> never should. Fancy finding out that he had a
      tailor&rsquo;s bill, and used boot-hooks, like Hans. Who ever thought of
      his marrying?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;When I drew a wedding for a
      frontispiece to &lsquo;Hearts and Diamonds,&rsquo; I made a sort of
      likeness to him for the bridegroom, and I went about looking for a grand
      woman who would do for his countess, but I saw none that would not be poor
      creatures by the side of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have seen this Mrs. Grandcourt then,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Meyrick. &ldquo;Hans says that she and Mr. Deronda set each other off when
      they are side by side. She is tall and fair. But you know her, Mirah&mdash;you
      can always say something descriptive. What do <i>you</i> think of Mrs.
      Grandcourt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she is the <i>Princess of Eboli</i> in <i>Don Carlos</i>,&rdquo;
      said Mirah, with a quick intensity. She was pursuing an association in her
      own mind not intelligible to her hearers&mdash;an association with a
      certain actress as well as the part she represented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your comparison is a riddle for me, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Meyrick, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said that Mrs. Grandcourt was tall and fair,&rdquo; continued
      Mirah, slightly paler. &ldquo;That is quite true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s quick eye and ear detected something unusual, but
      immediately explained it to herself. Fine ladies had often wounded Mirah
      by caprices of manner and intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Grandcourt had thought of having lessons of Mirah,&rdquo; she
      said turning to Anna. &ldquo;But many have talked of having lessons, and
      then have found no time. Fashionable ladies have too much work to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the chat went on without further insistence on the <i>Princess of
      Eboli</i>. That comparison escaped Mirah&rsquo;s lips under the urgency of
      a pang unlike anything she had felt before. The conversation from the
      beginning had revived unpleasant impressions, and Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s
      suggestion of Gwendolen&rsquo;s figure by the side of Deronda&rsquo;s had
      the stinging effect of a voice outside her, confirming her secret
      conviction that this tall and fair woman had some hold on his lot. For a
      long while afterward she felt as if she had had a jarring shock through
      her frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, putting her cheek against her brother&rsquo;s shoulder as
      she was sitting by him, while he sat propped up in bed under a new
      difficulty of breathing, she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ezra, does it ever hurt your love for Mr. Deronda that so much of
      his life was all hidden away from you&mdash;that he is amongst persons and
      cares about persons who are all so unlike us&mdash;I mean unlike you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, assuredly no,&rdquo; said Mordecai. &ldquo;Rather it is a
      precious thought to me that he has a preparation which I lacked, and is an
      accomplished Egyptian.&rdquo; Then, recollecting that his words had
      reference which his sister must not yet understand, he added, &ldquo;I
      have the more to give him, since his treasure differs from mine. That is a
      blessedness in friendship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah mused a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it would be a trial to your love for
      him if that other part of his life were like a crowd in which he had got
      entangled, so that he was carried away from you&mdash;I mean in his
      thoughts, and not merely carried out of sight as he is now&mdash;and not
      merely for a little while, but continually. How should you bear that! Our
      religion commands us to bear. But how should you bear it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not well, my sister&mdash;not well; but it will never happen,&rdquo;
      said Mordecai, looking at her with a tender smile. He thought that her
      heart needed comfort on his account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah said no more. She mused over the difference between her own state of
      mind and her brother&rsquo;s, and felt her comparative pettiness. Why
      could she not be completely satisfied with what satisfied his larger
      judgment? She gave herself no fuller reason than a painful sense of
      unfitness&mdash;in what? Airy possibilities to which she could give no
      outline, but to which one name and one figure gave the wandering
      persistency of a blot in her vision. Here lay the vaguer source of the
      hidden sadness rendered noticeable to Hans by some diminution of that
      sweet ease, that ready joyousness of response in her speech and smile,
      which had come with the new sense of freedom and safety, and had made her
      presence like the freshly-opened daisies and clear bird-notes after the
      rain. She herself regarded her uneasiness as a sort of ingratitude and
      dullness of sensibility toward the great things that had been given her in
      her new life; and whenever she threw more energy than usual into her
      singing, it was the energy of indignation against the shallowness of her
      own content. In that mood she once said, &ldquo;Shall I tell you what is
      the difference between you and me, Ezra? You are a spring in the drought,
      and I am an acorn-cup; the waters of heaven fill me, but the least little
      shake leaves me empty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what has shaken thee?&rdquo; said Mordecai. He fell into this
      antique form of speech habitually in talking to his sister and to the
      Cohen children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thoughts,&rdquo; said Mirah; &ldquo;thoughts that come like the
      breeze and shake me&mdash;bad people, wrong things, misery&mdash;and how
      they might touch our life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must take our portion, Mirah. It is there. On whose shoulder
      would we lay it, that we might be free?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The one voluntary sign she made of her inward care was this distant
      allusion.

      CHAPTER LIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;My desolation does begin to make
  A better life.&rdquo;
       &mdash;SHAKESPEARE: <i>Antony and Cleopatra.</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      Before Deronda was summoned to a second interview with his mother, a day
      had passed in which she had only sent him a message to say that she was
      not yet well enough to receive him again; but on the third morning he had
      a note saying, &ldquo;I leave to-day. Come and see me at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was shown into the same room as before; but it was much darkened with
      blinds and curtains. The Princess was not there, but she presently
      entered, dressed in a loose wrap of some soft silk, in color a dusky
      orange, her head again with black lace floating about it, her arms showing
      themselves bare from under her wide sleeves. Her face seemed even more
      impressive in the sombre light, the eyes larger, the lines more vigorous.
      You might have imagined her a sorceress who would stretch forth her
      wonderful hand and arm to mix youth-potions for others, but scorned to mix
      them for herself, having had enough of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her arms on her son&rsquo;s shoulders at once, and kissed him on
      both cheeks, then seated herself among her cushions with an air of assured
      firmness and dignity unlike her fitfulness in their first interview, and
      told Deronda to sit down by her. He obeyed, saying, &ldquo;You are quite
      relieved now, I trust?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am at ease again. Is there anything more that you would like
      to ask me?&rdquo; she said, with the matter of a queen rather than of a
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I find the house in Genoa where you used to live with my
      grandfather?&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, with a deprecating movement of her arm,
      &ldquo;it is pulled down&mdash;not to be found. But about our family, and
      where my father lived at various times&mdash;you will find all that among
      the papers in the chest, better than I can tell you. My father, I told
      you, was a physician. My mother was a Morteira. I used to hear all those
      things without listening. You will find them all. I was born amongst them
      without my will. I banished them as soon as I could.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda tried to hide his pained feeling, and said, &ldquo;Anything else
      that I should desire to know from you could only be what it is some
      satisfaction to your own feeling to tell me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have told you everything that could be demanded of me,&rdquo;
      said the Princess, looking coldly meditative. It seemed as if she had
      exhausted her emotion in their former interview. The fact was, she had
      said to herself, &ldquo;I have done it all. I have confessed all. I will
      not go through it again. I will save myself from agitation.&rdquo; And she
      was acting out that scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to Deronda&rsquo;s nature the moment was cruel; it made the filial
      yearning of his life a disappointed pilgrimage to a shrine where there
      were no longer the symbols of sacredness. It seemed that all the woman
      lacking in her was present in him, as he said, with some tremor in his
      voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then are we to part and I never be anything to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better so,&rdquo; said the Princess, in a softer, mellower
      voice. &ldquo;There could be nothing but hard duty for you, even if it
      were possible for you to take the place of my son. You would not love me.
      Don&rsquo;t deny it,&rdquo; she said, abruptly, putting up her hand.
      &ldquo;I know what is the truth. You don&rsquo;t like what I did. You are
      angry with me. You think I robbed you of something. You are on your
      grandfather&rsquo;s side, and you will always have a condemnation of me in
      your heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda felt himself under a ban of silence. He rose from his seat by her,
      preferring to stand, if he had to obey that imperious prohibition of any
      tenderness. But his mother now looked up at him with a new admiration in
      her glance, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong to be angry with me. You are the better for what I
      did.&rdquo; After pausing a little, she added, abruptly, &ldquo;And now
      tell me what you shall do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean now, immediately,&rdquo; said Deronda; &ldquo;or as to
      the course of my future life?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean in the future. What difference will it make to you that I
      have told you about your birth?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very great difference,&rdquo; said Deronda, emphatically. &ldquo;I
      can hardly think of anything that would make a greater difference.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall you do then?&rdquo; said the Princess, with more
      sharpness. &ldquo;Make yourself just like your grandfather&mdash;be what
      he wished you&mdash;turn yourself into a Jew like him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is impossible. The effect of my education can never be done
      away with. The Christian sympathies in which my mind was reared can never
      die out of me,&rdquo; said Deronda, with increasing tenacity of tone.
      &ldquo;But I consider it my duty&mdash;it is the impulse of my feeling&mdash;to
      identify myself, as far as possible, with my hereditary people, and if I
      can see any work to be done for them that I can give my soul and hand to I
      shall choose to do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother had her eyes fixed on him with a wondering speculation,
      examining his face as if she thought that by close attention she could
      read a difficult language there. He bore her gaze very firmly, sustained
      by a resolute opposition, which was the expression of his fullest self.
      She bent toward him a little, and said, with a decisive emphasis,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in love with a Jewess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda colored and said, &ldquo;My reasons would be independent of any
      such fact.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know better. I have seen what men are,&rdquo; said the Princess,
      peremptorily. &ldquo;Tell me the truth. She is a Jewess who will not
      accept any one but a Jew. There <i>are</i> a few such,&rdquo; she added,
      with a touch of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda had that objection to answer which we all have known in speaking
      to those who are too certain of their own fixed interpretations to be
      enlightened by anything we may say. But besides this, the point
      immediately in question was one on which he felt a repugnance either to
      deny or affirm. He remained silent, and she presently said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love her as your father loved me, and she draws you after her
      as I drew him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Those words touched Deronda&rsquo;s filial imagination, and some
      tenderness in his glance was taken by his mother as an assent. She went on
      with rising passion: &ldquo;But I was leading him the other way. And now
      your grandfather is getting his revenge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Deronda, remonstrantly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let
      us think of it in that way. I will admit that there may come some benefit
      from the education you chose for me. I prefer cherishing the benefit with
      gratitude, to dwelling with resentment on the injury. I think it would
      have been right that I should have been brought up with the consciousness
      that I was a Jew, but it must always have been a good to me to have as
      wide an instruction and sympathy as possible. And now, you have restored
      me my inheritance&mdash;events have brought a fuller restitution than you
      could have made&mdash;you have been saved from robbing my people of my
      service and me of my duty: can you not bring your whole soul to consent to
      this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda paused in his pleading: his mother looked at him listeningly, as
      if the cadence of his voice were taking her ear, yet she shook her head
      slowly. He began again, even more urgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have told me that you sought what you held the best for me:
      open your heart to relenting and love toward my grandfather, who sought
      what he held the best for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for me, no,&rdquo; she said, shaking her head with more
      absolute denial, and folding her arms tightly. &ldquo;I tell you, he never
      thought of his daughter except as an instrument. Because I had wants
      outside his purpose, I was to be put in a frame and tortured. If that is
      the right law for the world, I will not say that I love it. If my acts
      were wrong&mdash;if it is God who is exacting from me that I should
      deliver up what I withheld&mdash;who is punishing me because I deceived my
      father and did not warn him that I should contradict his trust&mdash;well,
      I have told everything. I have done what I could. And <i>your</i> soul
      consents. That is enough. I have after all been the instrument my father
      wanted.&mdash;&lsquo;I desire a grandson who shall have a true Jewish
      heart. Every Jew should rear his family as if he hoped that a Deliverer
      might spring from it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In uttering these last sentences the Princess narrowed her eyes, waved her
      head up and down, and spoke slowly with a new kind of chest-voice, as if
      she were quoting unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were those my grandfather&rsquo;s words?&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; and you will find them written. I wanted to thwart him,&rdquo;
      said the Princess, with a sudden outburst of the passion she had shown in
      the former interview. Then she added more slowly, &ldquo;You would have me
      love what I have hated from the time I was so high&rdquo;&mdash;here she
      held her left hand a yard from the floor.&mdash;&ldquo;That can never be.
      But what does it matter? His yoke has been on me, whether I loved it or
      not. You are the grandson he wanted. You speak as men do&mdash;as if you
      felt yourself wise. What does it all mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tone was abrupt and scornful. Deronda, in his pained feeling, and
      under the solemn urgency of the moment, had to keep a clutching
      remembrance of their relationship, lest his words should become cruel. He
      began in a deep entreating tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, don&rsquo;t say that I feel myself wise. We are set in the
      midst of difficulties. I see no other way to get any clearness than by
      being truthful&mdash;not by keeping back facts which may&mdash;which
      should carry obligation within them&mdash;which should make the only
      guidance toward duty. No wonder if such facts come to reveal themselves in
      spite of concealments. The effects prepared by generations are likely to
      triumph over a contrivance which would bend them all to the satisfaction
      of self. Your will was strong, but my grandfather&rsquo;s trust which you
      accepted and did not fulfill&mdash;what you call his yoke&mdash;is the
      expression of something stronger, with deeper, farther-spreading roots,
      knit into the foundations of sacredness for all men. You renounced me&mdash;you
      still banish me&mdash;as a son&rdquo;&mdash;there was an involuntary
      movement of indignation in Deronda&rsquo;s voice&mdash;&ldquo;But that
      stronger Something has determined that I shall be all the more the
      grandson whom also you willed to annihilate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother was watching him fixedly, and again her face gathered
      admiration. After a moment&rsquo;s silence she said, in a low, persuasive
      tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down again,&rdquo; and he obeyed, placing himself beside her.
      She laid her hand on his shoulder and went on,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You rebuke me. Well&mdash;I am the loser. And you are angry because
      I banish you. What could you do for me but weary your own patience? Your
      mother is a shattered woman. My sense of life is little more than a sense
      of what was&mdash;except when the pain is present. You reproach me that I
      parted with you. I had joy enough without you then. Now you are come back
      to me, and I cannot make you a joy. Have you the cursing spirit of the Jew
      in you? Are you not able to forgive me? Shall you be glad to think that I
      am punished because I was not a Jewish mother to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you ask me that?&rdquo; said Deronda, remonstrantly.
      &ldquo;Have I not besought you that I might now at least be a son to you?
      My grief is that you have declared me helpless to comfort you. I would
      give up much that is dear for the sake of soothing your anguish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall give up nothing,&rdquo; said his mother, with the hurry
      of agitation. &ldquo;You shall be happy. You shall let me think of you as
      happy. I shall have done you no harm. You have no reason to curse me. You
      shall feel for me as they feel for the dead whom they say prayers for&mdash;you
      shall long that I may be freed from all suffering&mdash;from all
      punishment. And I shall see you instead of always seeing your grandfather.
      Will any harm come to me because I broke his trust in the daylight after
      he was gone into darkness? I cannot tell:&mdash;if you think <i>Kaddish</i>
      will help me&mdash;say it, say it. You will come between me and the dead.
      When I am in your mind, you will look as you do now&mdash;always as if you
      were a tender son&mdash;always&mdash;as if I had been a tender mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed resolved that her agitation should not conquer her, but he felt
      her hand trembling on his shoulder. Deep, deep compassion hemmed in all
      words. With a face of beseeching he put his arm around her and pressed her
      head tenderly under his. They sat so for some moments. Then she lifted her
      head again and rose from her seat with a great sigh, as if in that breath
      she were dismissing a weight of thoughts. Deronda, standing in front of
      her, felt that the parting was near. But one of her swift alternations had
      come upon his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she beautiful?&rdquo; she said, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said Deronda, changing color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman you love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a moment for deliberate explanation. He was obliged to say,
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not ambitious?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I think not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one who must have a path of her own?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think her nature is not given to make great claims.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not like that?&rdquo; said the Princess, taking from her
      wallet a miniature with jewels around it, and holding it before her son.
      It was her own in all the fire of youth, and as Deronda looked at it with
      admiring sadness, she said, &ldquo;Had I not a rightful claim to be
      something more than a mere daughter and mother? The voice and the genius
      matched the face. Whatever else was wrong, acknowledge that I had a right
      to be an artist, though my father&rsquo;s will was against it. My nature
      gave me a charter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do acknowledge that,&rdquo; said Deronda, looking from the
      miniature to her face, which even in its worn pallor had an expression of
      living force beyond anything that the pencil could show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take the portrait?&rdquo; said the Princess, more gently.
      &ldquo;If she is a kind woman, teach her to think of me kindly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be grateful for the portrait,&rdquo; said Deronda, &ldquo;but&mdash;I
      ought to say, I have no assurance that she whom I love will have any love
      for me. I have kept silence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who and what is she?&rdquo; said the mother. The question seemed a
      command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was brought up as a singer for the stage,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      with inward reluctance. &ldquo;Her father took her away early from her
      mother, and her life has been unhappy. She is very young&mdash;only
      twenty. Her father wished to bring her up in disregard&mdash;even in
      dislike of her Jewish origin, but she has clung with all her affection to
      the memory of her mother and the fellowship of her people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, like you. She is attached to the Judaism she knows nothing of,&rdquo;
      said the Princess, peremptorily. &ldquo;That is poetry&mdash;fit to last
      through an opera night. Is she fond of her artist&rsquo;s life&mdash;is
      her singing worth anything?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her singing is exquisite. But her voice is not suited to the stage.
      I think that the artist&rsquo;s life has been made repugnant to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, she is made for you then. Sir Hugo said you were bitterly
      against being a singer, and I can see that you would never have let
      yourself be merged in a wife, as your father was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat,&rdquo; said Deronda, emphatically&mdash;&ldquo;I repeat
      that I have no assurance of her love for me, of the possibility that we
      can ever be united. Other things&mdash;painful issues may lie before me. I
      have always felt that I should prepare myself to renounce, not cherish
      that prospect. But I suppose I might feel so of happiness in general.
      Whether it may come or not, one should try and prepare one&rsquo;s self to
      do without it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel in that way?&rdquo; said his mother, laying her hands
      on his shoulders, and perusing his face, while she spoke in a low
      meditative tone, pausing between her sentences. &ldquo;Poor boy!&mdash;&mdash;I
      wonder how it would have been if I had kept you with me&mdash;&mdash;whether
      you would have turned your heart to the old things against mine&mdash;&mdash;and
      we should have quarreled&mdash;&mdash;your grandfather would have been in
      you&mdash;&mdash;and you would have hampered my life with your young
      growth from the old root.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think my affection might have lasted through all our quarreling,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, saddened more and more, &ldquo;and that would not have
      hampered&mdash;surely it would have enriched your life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not then, not then&mdash;&mdash;I did not want it then&mdash;&mdash;I
      might have been glad of it now,&rdquo; said the mother, with a bitter
      melancholy, &ldquo;if I could have been glad of anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you love your other children, and they love you?&rdquo; said
      Deronda, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she answered, as to a question about a matter of
      course, while she folded her arms again. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;she
      added in a deeper tone,&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;I am not a loving woman. That
      is the truth. It is a talent to love&mdash;I lack it. Others have loved me&mdash;and
      I have acted their love. I know very well what love makes of men and women&mdash;it
      is subjection. It takes another for a larger self, enclosing this one,&rdquo;&mdash;she
      pointed to her own bosom. &ldquo;I was never willingly subject to any man.
      Men have been subject to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the man who was subject was the happier of the two,&rdquo;
      said Deronda&mdash;not with a smile, but with a grave, sad sense of his
      mother&rsquo;s privation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;but I <i>was</i> happy&mdash;for a few years I was
      happy. If I had not been afraid of defeat and failure, I might have gone
      on. I miscalculated. What then? It is all over. Another life! Men talk of
      &lsquo;another life,&rsquo; as if it only began on the other side of the
      grave. I have long entered on another life.&rdquo; With the last words she
      raised her arms till they were bare to the elbow, her brow was contracted
      in one deep fold, her eyes were closed, her voice was smothered: in her
      dusky flame-colored garment, she looked like a dreamed visitant from some
      region of departed mortals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda&rsquo;s feeling was wrought to a pitch of acuteness in which he
      was no longer quite master of himself. He gave an audible sob. His mother
      opened her eyes, and letting her hands again rest on his shoulders, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my son, good-bye. We shall hear no more of each other.
      Kiss me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He clasped his arms round her neck, and they kissed each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda did not know how he got out of the room. He felt an older man. All
      his boyish yearnings and anxieties about his mother had vanished. He had
      gone through a tragic experience which must forever solemnize his life and
      deepen the significance of the acts by which he bound himself to others.

      CHAPTER LIV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;The unwilling brain
  Feigns often what it would not; and we trust
  Imagination with such phantasies
  As the tongue dares not fashion into words;
  Which have no words, their horror makes them dim
  To the mind&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;
                                           &mdash;SHELLEY.
</pre>
    <p>
      Madonna Pia, whose husband, feeling himself injured by her, took her to
      his castle amid the swampy flats of the Maremma and got rid of her there,
      makes a pathetic figure in Dante&rsquo;s Purgatory, among the sinners who
      repented at the last and desire to be remembered compassionately by their
      fellow-countrymen. We know little about the grounds of mutual discontent
      between the Siennese couple, but we may infer with some confidence that
      the husband had never been a very delightful companion, and that on the
      flats of the Maremma his disagreeable manners had a background which threw
      them out remarkably; whence in his desire to punish his wife to the
      upmost, the nature of things was so far against him that in relieving
      himself of her he could not avoid making the relief mutual. And thus,
      without any hardness to the poor Tuscan lady, who had her deliverance long
      ago, one may feel warranted in thinking of her with a less sympathetic
      interest than of the better known Gwendolen who, instead of being
      delivered from her errors on earth and cleansed from their effect in
      purgatory, is at the very height of her entanglement in those fatal meshes
      which are woven within more closely than without, and often make the
      inward torture disproportionate to what is discernable as outward cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      In taking his wife with him on a yachting expedition, Grandcourt had no
      intention to get rid of her; on the contrary, he wanted to feel more
      securely that she was his to do as he liked with, and to make her feel it
      also. Moreover, he was himself very fond of yachting: its dreamy
      do-nothing absolutism, unmolested by social demands, suited his
      disposition, and he did not in the least regard it as an equivalent for
      the dreariness of the Maremma. He had his reasons for carrying Gwendolen
      out of reach, but they were not reasons that can seem black in the mere
      statement. He suspected a growing spirit of opposition in her, and his
      feeling about the sentimental inclination she betrayed for Deronda was
      what in another man he would have called jealousy. In himself it seemed
      merely a resolution to put an end to such foolery as must have been going
      on in that prearranged visit of Deronda&rsquo;s which he had divined and
      interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Grandcourt might have pleaded that he was perfectly justified in
      taking care that his wife should fulfill the obligations she had accepted.
      Her marriage was a contract where all the ostensible advantages were on
      her side, and it was only of those advantages that her husband should use
      his power to hinder her from any injurious self committal or unsuitable
      behavior. He knew quite well that she had not married him&mdash;had not
      overcome her repugnance to certain facts&mdash;out of love to him
      personally; he had won her by the rank and luxuries he had to give her,
      and these she had got: he had fulfilled his side of the contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gwendolen, we know, was thoroughly aware of the situation. She could
      not excuse herself by saying that there had been a tacit part of the
      contract on her side&mdash;namely, that she meant to rule and have her own
      way. With all her early indulgence in the disposition to dominate, she was
      not one of the narrow-brained women who through life regard all their own
      selfish demands as rights, and every claim upon themselves as an injury.
      She had a root of conscience in her, and the process of purgatory had
      begun for her on the green earth: she knew that she had been wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now enter into the soul of this young creature as she found herself,
      with the blue Mediterranean dividing her from the world, on the tiny
      plank-island of a yacht, the domain of the husband to whom she felt that
      she had sold herself, and had been paid the strict price&mdash;nay, paid
      more than she had dared to ask in the handsome maintenance of her mother:&mdash;the
      husband to whom she had sold her truthfulness and sense of justice, so
      that he held them throttled into silence, collared and dragged behind him
      to witness what he would, without remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had she to complain of? The yacht was of the prettiest; the cabin
      fitted up to perfection, smelling of cedar, soft-cushioned, hung with
      silk, expanded with mirrors; the crew such as suited an elegant toy, one
      of them having even ringlets, as well as a bronze complexion and fine
      teeth; and Mr. Lush was not there, for he had taken his way back to
      England as soon as he had seen all and everything on board. Moreover,
      Gwendolen herself liked the sea: it did not make her ill; and to observe
      the rigging of the vessel and forecast the necessary adjustments was a
      sort of amusement that might have gratified her activity and enjoyment of
      imaginary rule; the weather was fine, and they were coasting southward,
      where even the rain-furrowed, heat-cracked clay becomes gem-like with
      purple shadows, and where one may float between blue and blue in an
      open-eyed dream that the world has done with sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what can still that hunger of the heart which sickens the eye for
      beauty, and makes sweet-scented ease an oppression? What sort of Moslem
      paradise would quiet the terrible fury of moral repulsion and cowed
      resistance which, like an eating pain intensifying into torture,
      concentrates the mind in that poisonous misery? While Gwendolen, throned
      on her cushions at evening, and beholding the glory of sea and sky
      softening as if with boundless love around her, was hoping that Grandcourt
      in his march up and down was not going to pause near her, not going to
      look at her or speak to her, some woman, under a smoky sky, obliged to
      consider the price of eggs in arranging her dinner, was listening for the
      music of a footstep that would remove all risk from her foretaste of joy;
      some couple, bending cheek by cheek, over a bit of work done by the one
      and delighted in by the other, were reckoning the earnings that would make
      them rich enough for a holiday among the furze and heather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Grandcourt the least conception of what was going on in the breast of
      his wife? He conceived that she did not love him; but was that necessary?
      She was under his power, and he was not accustomed to soothe himself, as
      some cheerfully-disposed persons are, with the conviction that he was very
      generally and justly beloved. But what lay quite away from his conception
      was, that she could have any special repulsion for him personally. How
      could she? He himself knew what personal repulsion was&mdash;nobody
      better; his mind was much furnished with a sense of what brutes his
      fellow-creatures were, both masculine and feminine; what odious
      familiarities they had, what smirks, what modes of flourishing their
      handkerchiefs, what costume, what lavender water, what bulging eyes, and
      what foolish notions of making themselves agreeable by remarks which were
      not wanted. In this critical view of mankind there was an affinity between
      him and Gwendolen before their marriage, and we know that she had been
      attractingly wrought upon by the refined negations he presented to her.
      Hence he understood her repulsion for Lush. But how was he to understand
      or conceive her present repulsion for Henleigh Grandcourt? Some men bring
      themselves to believe, and not merely maintain, the non-existence of an
      external world; a few others believe themselves objects of repulsion to a
      woman without being told so in plain language. But Grandcourt did not
      belong to this eccentric body of thinkers. He had all his life had reason
      to take a flattering view of his own attractiveness, and to place himself
      in fine antithesis to the men who, he saw at once, must be revolting to a
      woman of taste. He had no idea of moral repulsion, and could not have
      believed, if he had been told it, that there may be a resentment and
      disgust which will gradually make beauty more detestable than ugliness,
      through exasperation at that outward virtue in which hateful things can
      flaunt themselves or find a supercilious advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, then, could Grandcourt divine what was going on in Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      breast?
    </p>
    <p>
      For their behavior to each other scandalized no observer&mdash;not even
      the foreign maid, warranted against sea-sickness; nor Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      own experienced valet: still less the picturesque crew, who regarded them
      as a model couple in high life. Their companionship consisted chiefly in a
      well-bred silence. Grandcourt had no humorous observations at which
      Gwendolen could refuse to smile, no chit-chat to make small occasions of
      dispute. He was perfectly polite in arranging an additional garment over
      her when needful, and in handing her any object that he perceived her to
      need, and she could not fall into the vulgarity of accepting or rejecting
      such politeness rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt put up his telescope and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
      plantation of sugar-canes at the foot of that rock; should you like to
      look?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen said, &ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; remembering that she must try
      and interest herself in sugar-canes as something outside her personal
      affairs. Then Grandcourt would walk up and down and smoke for a long
      while, pausing occasionally to point out a sail on the horizon, and at
      last would seat himself and look at Gwendolen with his narrow immovable
      gaze, as if she were part of the complete yacht; while she, conscious of
      being looked at was exerting her ingenuity not to meet his eyes. At dinner
      he would remark that the fruit was getting stale, and they must put in
      somewhere for more; or, observing that she did not drink the wine, he
      asked her if she would like any other kind better. A lady was obliged to
      respond to these things suitably; and even if she had not shrunk from
      quarrelling on other grounds, quarreling with Grandcourt was impossible;
      she might as well have made angry remarks to a dangerous serpent
      ornamentally coiled in her cabin without invitation. And what sort of
      dispute could a woman of any pride and dignity begin on a yacht?
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt had intense satisfaction in leading his wife captive after this
      fashion; it gave their life on a small scale a royal representation and
      publicity in which every thing familiar was got rid of, and every body
      must do what was expected of them whatever might be their private protest&mdash;the
      protest (kept strictly private) adding to the piquancy of despotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Gwendolen, who even in the freedom of her maiden time, had had very
      faint glimpses of any heroism or sublimity, the medium that now thrust
      itself everywhere before her view was this husband and her relation to
      him. The beings closest to us, whether in love or hate, are often
      virtually our interpreters of the world, and some feather-headed gentleman
      or lady whom in passing we regret to take as legal tender for a human
      being, may be acting as a melancholy theory of life in the minds of those
      who live with them&mdash;like a piece of yellow and wavy glass that
      distorts form and makes color an affliction. Their trivial sentences,
      their petty standards, their low suspicions, their loveless <i>ennui</i>,
      may be making somebody else&rsquo;s life no better than a promenade
      through a pantheon of ugly idols. Gwendolen had that kind of window before
      her, affecting the distant equally with the near. Some unhappy wives are
      soothed by the possibility that they may become mothers; but Gwendolen
      felt that to desire a child for herself would have been a consenting to
      the completion of the injury she had been guilty of. She was reduced to
      dread lest she should become a mother. It was not the image of a new
      sweetly-budding life that came as a vision of deliverance from the
      monotony of distaste: it was an image of another sort. In the irritable,
      fluctuating stages of despair, gleams of hope came in the form of some
      possible accident. To dwell on the benignity of accident was a refuge from
      worse temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The embitterment of hatred is often as unaccountable to onlookers as the
      growth of devoted love, and it not only seems but is really out of direct
      relation with any outward causes to be alleged. Passion is of the nature
      of seed, and finds nourishment within, tending to a predominance which
      determines all currents toward itself, and makes the whole life its
      tributary. And the intensest form of hatred is that rooted in fear, which
      compels to silence and drives vehemence into a constructive
      vindictiveness, an imaginary annihilation of the detested object,
      something like the hidden rites of vengeance with which the persecuted
      have made a dark vent for their rage, and soothed their suffering into
      dumbness. Such hidden rites went on in the secrecy of Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      mind, but not with soothing effect&mdash;rather with the effect of a
      struggling terror. Side by side with the dread of her husband had grown
      the self-dread, which urged her to flee from the pursuing images wrought
      by her pent-up impulse. The vision of her past wrong-doing, and what it
      had brought on her, came with a pale ghastly illumination over every
      imagined deed that was a rash effort at freedom, such as she had made in
      her marriage. Moreover, she had learned to see all her acts through the
      impression they would make on Deronda: whatever relief might come to her,
      she could not sever it from the judgment of her that would be created in
      his mind. Not one word of flattery, of indulgence, of dependence on her
      favor, could be fastened on by her in all their intercourse, to weaken his
      restraining power over her (in this way Deronda&rsquo;s effort over
      himself was repaid); and amid the dreary uncertainties of her spoiled life
      the possible remedies that lay in his mind, nay, the remedy that lay in
      her feeling for him, made her only hope. He seemed to her a
      terrible-browed angel, from whom she could not think of concealing any
      deed so as to win an ignorant regard from him: it belonged to the nature
      of their relation that she should be truthful, for his power over her had
      begun in the raising of a self-discontent which could be satisfied only by
      genuine change. But in no concealment had she now any confidence: her
      vision of what she had to dread took more decidedly than ever the form of
      some fiercely impulsive deed, committed as in a dream that she would
      instantaneously wake from to find the effects real though the images had
      been false: to find death under her hands, but instead of darkness,
      daylight; instead of satisfied hatred, the dismay of guilt; instead of
      freedom, the palsy of a new terror&mdash;a white dead face from which she
      was forever trying to flee and forever held back. She remembered Deronda&rsquo;s
      words: they were continually recurring in her thought,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn your fear into a safeguard. Keep your dread fixed on the idea
      of increasing your remorse. * * * Take your fear as a safeguard. It is
      like quickness of hearing. It may make consequences passionately present
      to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was. In Gwendolen&rsquo;s consciousness temptation and dread met
      and stared like two pale phantoms, each seeing itself in the other&mdash;each
      obstructed by its own image; and all the while her fuller self beheld the
      apparitions and sobbed for deliverance from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inarticulate prayers, no more definite than a cry, often swept out from
      her into the vast silence, unbroken except by her husband&rsquo;s
      breathing or the plash of the wave or the creaking of the masts; but if
      ever she thought of definite help, it took the form of Deronda&rsquo;s
      presence and words, of the sympathy he might have for her, of the
      direction he might give her. It was sometimes after a white-lipped
      fierce-eyed temptation with murdering fingers had made its demon-visit
      that these best moments of inward crying and clinging for rescue would
      come to her, and she would lie with wide-open eyes in which the rising
      tears seemed a blessing, and the thought, &ldquo;I will not mind if I can
      keep from getting wicked,&rdquo; seemed an answer to the indefinite
      prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the days passed, taking with them light breezes beyond and about the
      Balearic Isles, and then to Sardinia, and then with gentle change
      persuading them northward again toward Corsica. But this floating,
      gentle-wafted existence, with its apparently peaceful influences, was
      becoming as bad as a nightmare to Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long are we to be yachting?&rdquo; she ventured to ask one day
      after they had been touching at Ajaccio, and the mere fact of change in
      going ashore had given her a relief from some of the thoughts which seemed
      now to cling about the very rigging of the vessel, mix with the air in the
      red silk cabin below, and make the smell of the sea odious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else should we do?&rdquo; said Grandcourt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not tired of it. I don&rsquo;t see why we shouldn&rsquo;t stay out any
      length of time. There&rsquo;s less to bore one in this way. And where
      would you go to? I&rsquo;m sick of foreign places. And we shall have
      enough of Ryelands. Would you rather be at Ryelands?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, indifferently, finding all places
      alike undescribable as soon as she imagined herself and her husband in
      them. &ldquo;I only wondered how long you would like this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like yachting longer than anything else,&rdquo; said Grandcourt;
      &ldquo;and I had none last year. I suppose you are beginning to tire of
      it. Women are so confoundedly whimsical. They expect everything to give
      way to them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no!&rdquo; said Gwendolen, letting out her scorn in a
      flute-like tone. &ldquo;I never expect you to give way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; said Grandcourt, with his inward voice,
      looking at her, and then choosing an orange&mdash;for they were at table.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made up her mind to a length of yachting that she could not see
      beyond; but the next day, after a squall which had made her rather ill for
      the first time, he came down to her and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been the devil&rsquo;s own work in the night. The
      skipper says we shall have to stay at Genoa for a week while things are
      set right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind that?&rdquo; said Gwendolen, who lay looking very white
      amidst her white drapery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so. Who wants to be broiling at Genoa?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a change,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, made a little
      incautious by her languor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want any change. Besides, the place is
      intolerable; and one can&rsquo;t move along the roads. I shall go out in a
      boat, as I used to do, and manage it myself. One can get a few hours every
      day in that way instead of striving in a damnable hotel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a prospect which held hope in it. Gwendolen thought of hours when
      she would be alone, since Grandcourt would not want to take her in the
      said boat, and in her exultation at this unlooked-for relief, she had
      wild, contradictory fancies of what she might do with her freedom&mdash;that
      &ldquo;running away&rdquo; which she had already innumerable times seen to
      be a worse evil than any actual endurance, now finding new arguments as an
      escape from her worse self. Also, visionary relief on a par with the fancy
      of a prisoner that the night wind may blow down the wall of his prison and
      save him from desperate devices, insinuated itself as a better
      alternative, lawful to wish for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fresh current of expectation revived her energies, and enabled her to
      take all things with an air of cheerfulness and alacrity that made a
      change marked enough to be noticed by her husband. She watched through the
      evening lights to the sinking of the moon with less of awed loneliness
      than was habitual to her&mdash;nay, with a vague impression that in this
      mighty frame of things there might be some preparation of rescue for her.
      Why not?&mdash;since the weather had just been on her side. This
      possibility of hoping, after her long fluctuation amid fears, was like a
      first return of hunger to the long-languishing patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was waked the next morning by the casting of the anchor in the port of
      Genoa&mdash;waked from a strangely-mixed dream in which she felt herself
      escaping over the Mont Cenis, and wondering to find it warmer even in the
      moonlight on the snow, till suddenly she met Deronda, who told her to go
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an hour or so from that dream she actually met Deronda. But it was on
      the palatial staircase of the <i>Italia</i>, where she was feeling warm in
      her light woolen dress and straw hat; and her husband was by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a start of surprise in Deronda before he could raise his hat and
      pass on. The moment did not seem to favor any closer greeting, and the
      circumstances under which they had last parted made him doubtful whether
      Grandcourt would be civilly inclined to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doubt might certainly have been changed into a disagreeable certainty,
      for Grandcourt on this unaccountable appearance of Deronda at Genoa of all
      places, immediately tried to conceive how there could have been an
      arrangement between him and Gwendolen. It is true that before they were
      well in their rooms, he had seen how difficult it was to shape such an
      arrangement with any probability, being too cool-headed to find it at once
      easily credible that Gwendolen had not only while in London hastened to
      inform Deronda of the yachting project, but had posted a letter to him
      from Marseilles or Barcelona, advising him to travel to Genoa in time for
      the chance of meeting her there, or of receiving a letter from her telling
      of some other destination&mdash;all which must have implied a miraculous
      foreknowledge in her, and in Deronda a bird-like facility in flying about
      and perching idly. Still he was there, and though Grandcourt would not
      make a fool of himself by fabrications that others might call
      preposterous, he was not, for all that, disposed to admit fully that
      Deronda&rsquo;s presence was, so far as Gwendolen was concerned, a mere
      accident. It was a disgusting fact; that was enough; and no doubt she was
      well pleased. A man out of temper does not wait for proofs before feeling
      toward all things animate and inanimate as if they were in a conspiracy
      against him, but at once threshes his horse or kicks his dog in
      consequence. Grandcourt felt toward Gwendolen and Deronda as if he knew
      them to be in a conspiracy against him, and here was an event in league
      with them. What he took for clearly certain&mdash;and so far he divined
      the truth&mdash;was that Gwendolen was now counting on an interview with
      Deronda whenever her husband&rsquo;s back was turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat taking his coffee at a convenient angle for observing her, he
      discerned something which he felt sure was the effect of a secret delight&mdash;some
      fresh ease in moving and speaking, some peculiar meaning in her eyes,
      whatever she looked on. Certainly her troubles had not marred her beauty.
      Mrs. Grandcourt was handsomer than Gwendolen Harleth: her grace and
      expression were informed by a greater variety of inward experience, giving
      new play to her features, new attitudes in movement and repose; her whole
      person and air had the nameless something which often makes a woman more
      interesting after marriage than before, less confident that all things are
      according to her opinion, and yet with less of deer-like shyness&mdash;more
      fully a human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning the benefits of the voyage seemed to be suddenly revealing
      themselves in a new elasticity of mien. As she rose from the table and put
      her two heavily-jewelled hands on each side of her neck, according to her
      wont, she had no art to conceal that sort of joyous expectation which
      makes the present more bearable than usual, just as when a man means to go
      out he finds it easier to be amiable to the family for a quarter of an
      hour beforehand. It is not impossible that a terrier whose pleasure was
      concerned would perceive those amiable signs and know their meaning&mdash;know
      why his master stood in a peculiar way, talked with alacrity, and even had
      a peculiar gleam in his eye, so that on the least movement toward the
      door, the terrier would scuttle to be in time. And, in dog fashion,
      Grandcourt discerned the signs of Gwendolen&rsquo;s expectation,
      interpreting them with the narrow correctness which leaves a world of
      unknown feeling behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;just ring, please, and tell Gibbs to order some dinner for
      us at three,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, as he too rose, took out a cigar, and
      then stretched his hand toward the hat that lay near. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      going to send Angus to find a little sailing-boat for us to go out in; one
      that I can manage, with you at the tiller. It&rsquo;s uncommonly pleasant
      these fine evenings&mdash;the least boring of anything we can do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen turned cold. There was not only the cruel disappointment; there
      was the immediate conviction that her husband had determined to take her
      because he would not leave her out of his sight; and probably this dual
      solitude in a boat was the more attractive to him because it would be
      wearisome to her. They were not on the plank-island; she felt it the more
      possible to begin a contest. But the gleaming content had died out of her.
      There was a change in her like that of a glacier after sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather not go in the boat,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Take
      some one else with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; if you don&rsquo;t go, I shall not go,&rdquo; said
      Grandcourt. &ldquo;We shall stay suffocating here, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to go in a boat,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a sudden change,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, with a slight
      sneer. &ldquo;But, since you decline, we shall stay indoors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid down his hat again, lit his cigar, and walked up and down the
      room, pausing now and then to look out of the windows. Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      temper told her to persist. She knew very well now that Grandcourt would
      not go without her; but if he must tyrannize over her, he should not do it
      precisely in the way he would choose. She would oblige him to stay in the
      hotel. Without speaking again, she passed into the adjoining bedroom and
      threw herself into a chair with her anger, seeing no purpose or issue&mdash;only
      feeling that the wave of evil had rushed back upon her, and dragged her
      away from her momentary breathing-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Grandcourt came in with his hat on, but threw it off and sat
      down sideways on a chair nearly in front of her, saying, in his
      superficial drawl,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come round yet? or do you find it agreeable to be out of
      temper. You make things uncommonly pleasant for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you want to make them unpleasant for <i>me</i>?&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, getting helpless again, and feeling the hot tears rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, will you be good enough to say what it is you have to complain
      of?&rdquo; said Grandcourt, looking into her eyes, and using his most
      inward voice. &ldquo;Is it that I stay indoors when you stay?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She could give no answer. The sort of truth that made any excuse for her
      anger could not be uttered. In the conflict of despair and humiliation she
      began to sob, and the tears rolled down her cheeks&mdash;a form of
      agitation which she had never shown before in her husband&rsquo;s
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope this is useful,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, after a moment or
      two. &ldquo;All I can say is, it&rsquo;s most confoundedly unpleasant.
      What the devil women can see in this kind of thing, I don&rsquo;t know. <i>You</i>
      see something to be got by it, of course. All I can see is, that we shall
      be shut up here when we might have been having a pleasant sail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go, then,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, impetuously. &ldquo;Perhaps
      we shall be drowned.&rdquo; She began to sob again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This extraordinary behavior, which had evidently some relation to Deronda,
      gave more definiteness to Grandcourt&rsquo;s conclusions. He drew his
      chair quite close in front of her, and said, in a low tone, &ldquo;Just be
      quiet and listen, will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be a magical effect in this close vicinity. Gwendolen
      shrank and ceased to sob. She kept her eyelids down and clasped her hands
      tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us understand each other,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, in the same
      tone. &ldquo;I know very well what this nonsense means. But if you suppose
      I am going to let you make a fool of me, just dismiss that notion from
      your mind. What are you looking forward to, if you can&rsquo;t behave
      properly as my wife? There is disgrace for you, if you like to have it,
      but I don&rsquo;t know anything else; and as to Deronda, it&rsquo;s quite
      clear that he hangs back from you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all false!&rdquo; said Gwendolen, bitterly. &ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t in the least imagine what is in my mind. I have seen enough of
      the disgrace that comes in that way. And you had better leave me at
      liberty to speak with any one I like. It will be better for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will allow me to judge of that,&rdquo; said Grandcourt, rising
      and moving to a little distance toward the window, but standing there
      playing with his whiskers as if he were awaiting something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s words had so clear and tremendous a meaning for herself
      that she thought they must have expressed it to Grandcourt, and had no
      sooner uttered them than she dreaded their effect. But his soul was
      garrisoned against presentiments and fears: he had the courage and
      confidence that belong to domination, and he was at that moment feeling
      perfectly satisfied that he held his wife with bit and bridle. By the time
      they had been married a year she would cease to be restive. He continued
      standing with his air of indifference, till she felt her habitual stifling
      consciousness of having an immovable obstruction in her life, like the
      nightmare of beholding a single form that serves to arrest all passage
      though the wide country lies open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What decision have you come to?&rdquo; he said, presently looking
      at her. &ldquo;What orders shall I give?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let us go,&rdquo; said Gwendolen. The walls had begun to be an
      imprisonment, and while there was breath in this man he would have the
      mastery over her. His words had the power of thumb-screws and the cold
      touch of the rock. To resist was to act like a stupid animal unable to
      measure results.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the boat was ordered. She even went down to the quay again with him to
      see it before midday. Grandcourt had recovered perfect quietude of temper,
      and had a scornful satisfaction in the attention given by the nautical
      groups to the <i>milord</i>, owner of the handsome yacht which had just
      put in for repairs, and who being an Englishman was naturally so at home
      on the sea that he could manage a sail with the same ease that he could
      manage a horse. The sort of exultation he had discerned in Gwendolen this
      morning she now thought that she discerned in him; and it was true that he
      had set his mind on this boating, and carried out his purpose as something
      that people might not expect him to do, with the gratified impulse of a
      strong will which had nothing better to exert itself upon. He had
      remarkable physical courage, and was proud of it&mdash;or rather he had a
      great contempt for the coarser, bulkier men who generally had less.
      Moreover, he was ruling that Gwendolen should go with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when they came down again at five o&rsquo;clock, equipped for their
      boating, the scene was as good as a theatrical representation for all
      beholders. This handsome, fair-skinned English couple, manifesting the
      usual eccentricity of their nation, both of them proud, pale, and calm,
      without a smile on their faces, moving like creatures who were fulfilling
      a supernatural destiny&mdash;it was a thing to go out and see, a thing to
      paint. The husband&rsquo;s chest, back, and arms, showed very well in his
      close-fitting dress, and the wife was declared to be a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some suggestions were proffered concerning a possible change in the
      breeze, and the necessary care in putting about, but Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      manner made the speakers understand that they were too officious, and that
      he knew better than they.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen, keeping her impassable air, as they moved away from the strand,
      felt her imagination obstinately at work. She was not afraid of any
      outward dangers&mdash;she was afraid of her own wishes which were taking
      shapes possible and impossible, like a cloud of demon-faces. She was
      afraid of her own hatred, which under the cold iron touch that had
      compelled her to-day had gathered a fierce intensity. As she sat guiding
      the tiller under her husband&rsquo;s eyes, doing just what he told her,
      the strife within her seemed like her own effort to escape from herself.
      She clung to the thought of Deronda: she persuaded herself that he would
      not go away while she was there&mdash;he knew that she needed help. The
      sense that he was there would save her from acting out the evil within.
      And yet quick, quick, came images, plans of evil that would come again and
      seize her in the night, like furies preparing the deed that they would
      straightway avenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were taken out of the port and carried eastward by a gentle breeze.
      Some clouds tempered the sunlight, and the hour was always deepening
      toward the supreme beauty of evening. Sails larger and smaller changed
      their aspect like sensitive things, and made a cheerful companionship,
      alternately near and far. The grand city shone more vaguely, the mountains
      looked out above it, and there was stillness as in an island sanctuary.
      Yet suddenly Gwendolen let her hands fall, and said in a scarcely audible
      tone, &ldquo;God help me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said Grandcourt, not distinguishing the
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, rousing herself from her
      momentary forgetfulness and resuming the ropes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you find this pleasant?&rdquo; said Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You admit now we couldn&rsquo;t have done anything better?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I see nothing better. I think we shall go on always, like
      the Flying Dutchman,&rdquo; said Gwendolen wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandcourt gave her one of his narrow examining glances, and then said,
      &ldquo;If you like, we can go to Spezia in the morning, and let them take
      us up there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I shall like nothing better than this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well: we&rsquo;ll do the same to-morrow. But we must be
      turning in soon. I shall put about.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER LV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;Ritorna a tua scienza
  Che vuol, quanto la cosa e più perfetta
  Più senta il bene, e cosi la doglienza.&rdquo;
                                          &mdash;DANTE.
</pre>
    <p>
      When Deronda met Gwendolen and Grandcourt on the staircase, his mind was
      seriously preoccupied. He had just been summoned to the second interview
      with his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two hours after his parting from her he knew that the Princess
      Halm-Eberstein had left the hotel, and so far as the purpose of his
      journey to Genoa was concerned, he might himself have set off on his way
      to Mainz, to deliver the letter from Joseph Kalonymos, and get possession
      of the family chest. But mixed mental conditions, which did not resolve
      themselves into definite reasons, hindered him from departure. Long after
      the farewell he was kept passive by a weight of retrospective feeling. He
      lived again, with the new keenness of emotive memory, through the exciting
      scenes which seemed past only in the sense of preparation for their actual
      presence in his soul. He allowed himself in his solitude to sob, with
      perhaps more than a woman&rsquo;s acuteness of compassion, over that woman&rsquo;s
      life so near to his, and yet so remote. He beheld the world changed for
      him by the certitude of ties that altered the poise of hopes and fears,
      and gave him a new sense of fellowship, as if under cover of the night he
      had joined the wrong band of wanderers, and found with the rise of morning
      that the tents of his kindred were grouped far off. He had a quivering
      imaginative sense of close relation to the grandfather who had been
      animated by strong impulses and beloved thoughts, which were now perhaps
      being roused from their slumber within himself. And through all this
      passionate meditation Mordecai and Mirah were always present, as beings
      who clasped hands with him in sympathetic silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of such quick, responsive fibre was Deronda made, under that mantle of
      self-controlled reserve into which early experience had thrown so much of
      his young strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the persistent ringing of a bell as a signal reminded him of the hour
      he thought of looking into <i>Bradshaw</i>, and making the brief necessary
      preparations for starting by the next train&mdash;thought of it, but made
      no movement in consequence. Wishes went to Mainz and what he was to get
      possession of there&mdash;to London and the beings there who made the
      strongest attachments of his life; but there were other wishes that clung
      in these moments to Genoa, and they kept him where he was by that force
      which urges us to linger over an interview that carries a presentiment of
      final farewell or of overshadowing sorrow. Deronda did not formally say,
      &ldquo;I will stay over to-night, because it is Friday, and I should like
      to go to the evening service at the synagogue where they must all have
      gone; and besides, I may see the Grandcourts again.&rdquo; But simply,
      instead of packing and ringing for his bill, he sat doing nothing at all,
      while his mind went to the synagogue and saw faces there probably little
      different from those of his grandfather&rsquo;s time, and heard the
      Spanish-Hebrew liturgy which had lasted through the seasons of wandering
      generations like a plant with wandering seed, that gives the far-off lands
      a kinship to the exile&rsquo;s home&mdash;while, also, his mind went
      toward Gwendolen, with anxious remembrance of what had been, and with a
      half-admitted impression that it would be hardness in him willingly to go
      away at once without making some effort, in spite of Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      probable dislike, to manifest the continuance of his sympathy with her
      since their abrupt parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state of mind he deferred departure, ate his dinner without sense
      of flavor, rose from it quickly to find the synagogue, and in passing the
      porter asked if Mr. and Mrs. Grandcourt were still in the hotel, and what
      was the number of their apartment. The porter gave him the number, but
      added that they were gone out boating. That information had somehow power
      enough over Deronda to divide his thoughts with the memories wakened among
      the sparse <i>talithim</i> and keen dark faces of worshippers whose way of
      taking awful prayers and invocations with the easy familiarity which might
      be called Hebrew dyed Italian, made him reflect that his grandfather,
      according to the Princess&rsquo;s hints of his character, must have been
      almost as exceptional a Jew as Mordecai. But were not men of ardent zeal
      and far-reaching hope everywhere exceptional? the men who had the visions
      which, as Mordecai said, were the creators and feeders of the world&mdash;moulding
      and feeding the more passive life which without them would dwindle and
      shrivel into the narrow tenacity of insects, unshaken by thoughts beyond
      the reach of their antennae. Something of a mournful impatience perhaps
      added itself to the solicitude about Gwendolen (a solicitude that had room
      to grow in his present release from immediate cares) as an incitement to
      hasten from the synagogue and choose to take his evening walk toward the
      quay, always a favorite haunt with him, and just now attractive with the
      possibility that he might be in time to see the Grandcourts come in from
      their boating. In this case, he resolved that he would advance to greet
      them deliberately, and ignore any grounds that the husband might have for
      wishing him elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had set behind a bank of cloud, and only a faint yellow light was
      giving its farewell kisses to the waves, which were agitated by an active
      breeze. Deronda, sauntering slowly within sight of what took place on the
      strand, observed the groups there concentrating their attention on a
      sailing-boat which was advancing swiftly landward, being rowed by two men.
      Amidst the clamorous talk in various languages, Deronda held it the surer
      means of getting information not to ask questions, but to elbow his way to
      the foreground and be an unobstructed witness of what was occurring.
      Telescopes were being used, and loud statements made that the boat held
      somebody who had been drowned. One said it was the <i>milord</i> who had
      gone out in a sailing boat; another maintained that the prostrate figure
      he discerned was <i>miladi</i>; a Frenchman who had no glass would rather
      say that it was <i>milord</i> who had probably taken his wife out to drown
      her, according to the national practice&mdash;a remark which an English
      skipper immediately commented on in our native idiom (as nonsense which&mdash;had
      undergone a mining operation), and further dismissed by the decision that
      the reclining figure was a woman. For Deronda, terribly excited by
      fluctuating fears, the strokes of the oars as he watched them were divided
      by swift visions of events, possible and impossible, which might have
      brought about this issue, or this broken-off fragment of an issue, with a
      worse half undisclosed&mdash;if this woman apparently snatched from the
      waters were really Mrs. Grandcourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But soon there was no longer any doubt: the boat was being pulled to land,
      and he saw Gwendolen half raising herself on her hands, by her own effort,
      under her heavy covering of tarpaulin and pea-jackets&mdash;pale as one of
      the sheeted dead, shivering, with wet hair streaming, a wild amazed
      consciousness in her eyes, as if she had waked up in a world where some
      judgment was impending, and the beings she saw around were coming to seize
      her. The first rower who jumped to land was also wet through, and ran off;
      the sailors, close about the boat, hindered Deronda from advancing, and he
      could only look on while Gwendolen gave scared glances, and seemed to
      shrink with terror as she was carefully, tenderly helped out, and led on
      by the strong arms of those rough, bronzed men, her wet clothes clinging
      about her limbs, and adding to the impediment of her weakness. Suddenly
      her wandering eyes fell on Deronda, standing before her, and immediately,
      as if she had been expecting him and looking for him, she tried to stretch
      out her arms, which were held back by her supporters, saying, in a muffled
      voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is come, it is come! He is dead!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; said Deronda, in a tone of authority; &ldquo;quiet
      yourself.&rdquo; Then to the men who were assisting her, &ldquo;I am a
      connection of this lady&rsquo;s husband. If you will get her on to the <i>Italia</i>
      as quickly as possible, I will undertake everything else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed behind to hear from the remaining boatman that her husband had
      gone down irrecoverably, and that his boat was left floating empty. He and
      his comrade had heard a cry, had come up in time to see the lady jump in
      after her husband, and had got her out fast enough to save her from much
      damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, Deronda hastened to the hotel to assure himself that the best
      medical help would be provided; and being satisfied on this point, he
      telegraphed the event to Sir Hugo, begging him to come forthwith, and also
      to Mr. Gascoigne, whose address at the rectory made his nearest known way
      of getting the information to Gwendolen&rsquo;s mother. Certain words of
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s in the past had come back to him with the effectiveness
      of an inspiration: in moments of agitated confession she had spoken of her
      mother&rsquo;s presence, as a possible help, if she could have had it.

  &ldquo;The pang, the curse with which they died,
    Had never passed away:
  I could not draw my eyes from theirs,
    Nor lift them up to pray.&rdquo;

</pre>
    <p>
      Deronda did not take off his clothes that night. Gwendolen, after
      insisting on seeing him again before she would consent to be undressed,
      had been perfectly quiet, and had only asked him, with a whispering,
      repressed eagerness, to promise that he would come to her when she sent
      for him in the morning. Still, the possibility that a change might come
      over her, the danger of a supervening feverish condition, and the
      suspicion that something in the late catastrophe was having an effect
      which might betray itself in excited words, acted as a foreboding within
      him. He mentioned to her attendant that he should keep himself ready to be
      called if there were any alarming change of symptoms, making it understood
      by all concerned that he was in communication with her friends in England,
      and felt bound meanwhile to take all care on her behalf&mdash;a position
      which it was the easier for him to assume, because he was well known to
      Grandcourt&rsquo;s valet, the only old servant who had come on the late
      voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when fatigue from the strangely various emotion of the day at last
      sent Deronda to sleep, he remained undisturbed except by the morning
      dreams, which came as a tangled web of yesterday&rsquo;s events, and
      finally waked him, with an image drawn by his pressing anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, it was morning, and there had been no summons&mdash;an augury which
      cheered him while he made his toilet, and reflected that it was too early
      to send inquiries. Later, he learned that she had passed a too wakeful
      night, but had shown no violent signs of agitation, and was at last
      sleeping. He wondered at the force that dwelt in this creature, so alive
      to dread; for he had an irresistible impression that even under the
      effects of a severe physical shock she was mastering herself with a
      determination of concealment. For his own part, he thought that his
      sensibilities had been blunted by what he had been going through in the
      meeting with his mother: he seemed to himself now to be only fulfilling
      claims, and his more passionate sympathy was in abeyance. He had lately
      been living so keenly in an experience quite apart from Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      lot, that his present cares for her were like a revisiting of scenes
      familiar in the past, and there was not yet a complete revival of the
      inward response to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile he employed himself in getting a formal, legally recognized
      statement from the fishermen who had rescued Gwendolen. Few details came
      to light. The boat in which Grandcourt had gone out had been found
      drifting with its sail loose, and had been towed in. The fishermen thought
      it likely that he had been knocked overboard by the flapping of the sail
      while putting about, and that he had not known how to swim; but, though
      they were near, their attention had been first arrested by a cry which
      seemed like that of a man in distress, and while they were hastening with
      their oars, they heard a shriek from the lady, and saw her jump in.
    </p>
    <p>
      On re-entering the hotel, Deronda was told that Gwendolen had risen, and
      was desiring to see him. He was shown into a room darkened by blinds and
      curtains, where she was seated with a white shawl wrapped round her,
      looking toward the opening door like one waiting uneasily. But her long
      hair was gathered up and coiled carefully, and, through all, the blue
      stars in her ears had kept their place: as she started impulsively to her
      full height, sheathed in her white shawl, her face and neck not less
      white, except for a purple line under her eyes, her lips a little apart
      with the peculiar expression of one accused and helpless, she looked like
      the unhappy ghost of that Gwendolen Harleth whom Deronda had seen turning
      with firm lips and proud self-possession from her losses at the gaming
      table. The sight pierced him with pity, and the effects of all their past
      relations began to revive within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beseech you to rest&mdash;not to stand,&rdquo; said Deronda, as
      he approached her; and she obeyed, falling back into her chair again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sit down near me?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to speak
      very low.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in a large arm-chair, and he drew a small one near to her side.
      The action seemed to touch her peculiarly: turning her pale face full upon
      his, which was very near, she said, in the lowest audible tone, &ldquo;You
      know I am a guilty woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda himself turned paler as he said, &ldquo;I know nothing.&rdquo; He
      did not dare to say more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo; She uttered this with the same undertoned
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Deronda, in a mournful suspense which made him
      reluctant to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His face will not be seen above the water again,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, in a tone that was not louder, but of a suppressed eagerness,
      while she held both her hands clenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by any one else&mdash;only by me&mdash;a dead face&mdash;I
      shall never get away from it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with an inward voice of desperate self-repression that she spoke
      these last words, while she looked away from Deronda toward something at a
      distance from her on the floor. She was seeing the whole event&mdash;her
      own acts included&mdash;through an exaggerating medium of excitement and
      horror? Was she in a state of delirium into which there entered a sense of
      concealment and necessity for self-repression? Such thoughts glanced
      through Deronda as a sort of hope. But imagine the conflict of feeling
      that kept him silent. She was bent on confession, and he dreaded hearing
      her confession. Against his better will he shrank from the task that was
      laid on him: he wished, and yet rebuked the wish as cowardly, that she
      could bury her secrets in her own bosom. He was not a priest. He dreaded
      the weight of this woman&rsquo;s soul flung upon his own with imploring
      dependence. But she spoke again, hurriedly, looking at him,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not say that I ought to tell the world? you will not say
      that I ought to be disgraced? I could not do it. I could not bear it. I
      cannot have my mother know. Not if I were dead. I could not have her know.
      I must tell you; but you will not say that any one else should know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can say nothing in my ignorance,&rdquo; said Deronda, mournfully,
      &ldquo;except that I desire to help you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you from the beginning&mdash;as soon as I could&mdash;I told
      you I was afraid of myself.&rdquo; There was a piteous pleading in the low
      murmur in which Deronda turned his ear only. Her face afflicted him too
      much. &ldquo;I felt a hatred in me that was always working like an evil
      spirit&mdash;contriving things. Everything I could do to free myself came
      into my mind; and it got worse&mdash;all things got worse. That is why I
      asked you to come to me in town. I thought then I would tell you the worst
      about myself. I tried. But I could not tell everything. And <i>he</i> came
      in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, while a shudder passed through her; but soon went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you everything now. Do you think a woman who cried, and
      prayed, and struggled to be saved from herself, could be a murderess?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; said Deronda, in a deep, shaken voice, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      torture me needlessly. You have not murdered him. You threw yourself into
      the water with the impulse to save him. Tell me the rest afterward. This
      death was an accident that you could not have hindered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be impatient with me.&rdquo; The tremor, the childlike
      beseeching in these words compelled Deronda to turn his head and look at
      her face. The poor quivering lips went on. &ldquo;You said&mdash;you used
      to say&mdash;you felt more for those who had done something wicked and
      were miserable; you said they might get better&mdash;they might be
      scourged into something better. If you had not spoken in that way,
      everything would have been worse. I <i>did</i> remember all you said to
      me. It came to me always. It came to me at the very last&mdash;that was
      the reason why I&mdash;But now, if you cannot bear with me when I tell you
      everything&mdash;if you turn away from me and forsake me, what shall I do?
      Am I worse than I was when you found me and wanted to make me better? All
      the wrong I have done was in me then&mdash;and more&mdash;and more&mdash;if
      you had not come and been patient with me. And now&mdash;will you forsake
      me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands, which had been so tightly clenched some minutes before, were
      now helplessly relaxed and trembling on the arm of her chair. Her
      quivering lips remained parted as she ceased speaking. Deronda could not
      answer; he was obliged to look away. He took one of her hands, and clasped
      it as if they were going to walk together like two children: it was the
      only way in which he could answer, &ldquo;I will not forsake you.&rdquo;
      And all the while he felt as if he were putting his name to a blank paper
      which might be filled up terribly. Their attitude, his adverted face with
      its expression of a suffering which he was solemnly resolved to undergo,
      might have told half the truth of the situation to a beholder who had
      suddenly entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      That grasp was an entirely new experience to Gwendolen: she had never
      before had from any man a sign of tenderness which her own being had
      needed, and she interpreted its powerful effect on her into a promise of
      inexhaustible patience and constancy. The stream of renewed strength made
      it possible for her to go on as she had begun&mdash;with that fitful,
      wandering confession where the sameness of experience seems to nullify the
      sense of time or of order in events. She began again in a fragmentary way,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All sorts of contrivances in my mind&mdash;but all so difficult.
      And I fought against them&mdash;I was terrified at them&mdash;I saw his
      dead face&rdquo;&mdash;here her voice sank almost to a whisper close to
      Deronda&rsquo;s ear&mdash;&ldquo;ever so long ago I saw it and I wished
      him to be dead. And yet it terrified me. I was like two creatures. I could
      not speak&mdash;I wanted to kill&mdash;it was as strong as thirst&mdash;and
      then directly&mdash;I felt beforehand I had done something dreadful,
      unalterable&mdash;that would make me like an evil spirit. And it came&mdash;it
      came.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent a moment or two, as if her memory had lost itself in a web
      where each mesh drew all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had all been in my mind when I first spoke to you&mdash;when we
      were at the Abbey. I had done something then. I could not tell you that.
      It was the only thing I did toward carrying out my thoughts. They went
      about over everything; but they all remained like dreadful dreams&mdash;all
      but one. I did one act&mdash;and I never undid it&mdash;it is there still&mdash;as
      long ago as when we were at Ryelands. There it was&mdash;something my
      fingers longed for among the beautiful toys in the cabinet in my boudoir&mdash;small
      and sharp like a long willow leaf in a silver sheath. I locked it in the
      drawer of my dressing-case. I was continually haunted with it and how I
      should use it. I fancied myself putting it under my pillow. But I never
      did. I never looked at it again. I dared not unlock the drawer: it had a
      key all to itself; and not long ago, when we were in the yacht, I dropped
      the key into the deep water. It was my wish to drop it and deliver myself.
      After that I began to think how I could open the drawer without the key:
      and when I found we were to stay at Genoa, it came into my mind that I
      could get it opened privately at the hotel. But then, when we were going
      up the stairs, I met you; and I thought I should talk to you alone and
      tell you this&mdash;everything I could not tell you in town; and then I
      was forced to go out in the boat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sob had for the first time risen with the last words, and she sank back
      in her chair. The memory of that acute disappointment seemed for the
      moment to efface what had come since. Deronda did not look at her, but he
      said, insistently,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it has all remained in your imagination. It has gone on only in
      your thought. To the last the evil temptation has been resisted?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. The tears had rolled down her cheeks. She pressed her
      handkerchief against them and sat upright. She was summoning her
      resolution; and again, leaning a little toward Deronda&rsquo;s ear, she
      began in a whisper,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I will tell you everything as God knows it. I will tell you
      no falsehood; I will tell you the exact truth. What should I do else? I
      used to think I could never be wicked. I thought of wicked people as if
      they were a long way off me. Since then I have been wicked. I have felt
      wicked. And everything has been a punishment to me&mdash;all the things I
      used to wish for&mdash;it is as if they had been made red-hot. The very
      daylight has often been a punishment to me. Because&mdash;you know&mdash;I
      ought not to have married. That was the beginning of it. I wronged some
      one else. I broke my promise. I meant to get pleasure for myself, and it
      all turned to misery. I wanted to make my gain out of another&rsquo;s loss&mdash;you
      remember?&mdash;it was like roulette&mdash;and the money burned into me.
      And I could not complain. It was as if I had prayed that another should
      lose and I should win. And I had won, I knew it all&mdash;I knew I was
      guilty. When we were on the sea, and I lay awake at night in the cabin, I
      sometimes felt that everything I had done lay open without excuse&mdash;nothing
      was hidden&mdash;how could anything be known to me only?&mdash;it was not
      my own knowledge, it was God&rsquo;s that had entered into me, and even
      the stillness&mdash;everything held a punishment for me&mdash;everything
      but you. I always thought that you would not want me to be punished&mdash;you
      would have tried and helped me to be better. And only thinking of that
      helped me. You will not change&mdash;you will not want to punish me now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a sob had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; groaned Deronda. But he sat motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      This long wandering with the conscious-stricken one over her past was
      difficult to bear, but he dared not again urge her with a question. He
      must let her mind follow its own need. She unconsciously left intervals in
      her retrospect, not clearly distinguishing between what she said and what
      she had only an inward vision of. Her next words came after such an
      interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That all made it so hard when I was forced to go in the boat.
      Because when I saw you it was an unexpected joy, and I thought I could
      tell you everything&mdash;about the locked-up drawer and what I had not
      told you before. And if I had told you, and knew it was in your mind, it
      would have less power over me. I hoped and trusted in that. For after all
      my struggles and my crying, the hatred and rage, the temptation that
      frightened me, the longing, the thirst for what I dreaded, always came
      back. And that disappointment&mdash;when I was quite shut out from
      speaking to you, and was driven to go in the boat&mdash;brought all the
      evil back, as if I had been locked in a prison with it and no escape. Oh,
      it seems so long ago now since I stepped into that boat! I could have
      given up everything in that moment, to have the forked lightning for a
      weapon to strike him dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the compressed fierceness that she was recalling seemed to find
      its way into her undertoned utterance. After a little silence she said,
      with agitated hurry,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he were here again, what should I do? I cannot wish him here&mdash;and
      yet I cannot bear his dead face. I was a coward. I ought to have borne
      contempt. I ought to have gone away&mdash;gone and wandered like a beggar
      rather than stay to feel like a fiend. But turn where I would there was
      something I could not bear. Sometimes I thought he would kill <i>me</i> if
      I resisted his will. But now&mdash;his dead face is there, and I cannot
      bear it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly loosing Deronda&rsquo;s hand, she started up, stretching her arms
      to their full length upward, and said with a sort of moan,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been a cruel woman! What can <i>I</i> do but cry for help?
      <i>I</i> am sinking. Die&mdash;die&mdash;you are forsaken&mdash;go down,
      go down into darkness. Forsaken&mdash;no pity&mdash;<i>I</i> shall be
      forsaken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank in her chair again and broke into sobs. Even Deronda had no place
      in her consciousness at that moment. He was completely unmanned. Instead
      of finding, as he had imagined, that his late experience had dulled his
      susceptibility to fresh emotion, it seemed that the lot of this young
      creature, whose swift travel from her bright rash girlhood into this agony
      of remorse he had had to behold in helplessness, pierced him the deeper
      because it came close upon another sad revelation of spiritual conflict:
      he was in one of those moments when the very anguish of passionate pity
      makes us ready to choose that we will know pleasure no more, and live only
      for the stricken and afflicted. He had risen from his seat while he
      watched that terrible outburst&mdash;which seemed the more awful to him
      because, even in this supreme agitation, she kept the suppressed voice of
      one who confesses in secret. At last he felt impelled to turn his back
      toward her and walk to a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently there was stillness. Her mind had opened to the sense that
      he had gone away from her. When Deronda turned round to approach her
      again, he saw her face bent toward him, her eyes dilated, her lips parted.
      She was an image of timid forlorn beseeching&mdash;too timid to entreat in
      words while he kept himself aloof from her. Was she forsaken by him&mdash;now&mdash;already?
      But his eyes met hers sorrowfully&mdash;met hers for the first time fully
      since she had said, &ldquo;You know I am a guilty woman,&rdquo; and that
      full glance in its intense mournfulness seemed to say, &ldquo;I know it,
      but I shall all the less forsake you.&rdquo; He sat down by her side again
      in the same attitude&mdash;without turning his face toward her and without
      again taking her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more Gwendolen was pierced, as she had been by his face of sorrow at
      the Abbey, with a compunction less egoistic than that which urged her to
      confess, and she said, in a tone of loving regret,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make you very unhappy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda gave an indistinct &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; just shrinking together and
      changing his attitude a little. Then he had gathered resolution enough to
      say clearly, &ldquo;There is no question of being happy or unhappy. What I
      most desire at this moment is what will most help you. Tell me all you
      feel it a relief to tell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Devoted as these words were, they widened his spiritual distance from her,
      and she felt it more difficult to speak: she had a vague need of getting
      nearer to that compassion which seemed to be regarding her from a halo of
      superiority, and the need turned into an impulse to humble herself more.
      She was ready to throw herself on her knees before him; but no&mdash;her
      wonderfully mixed consciousness held checks on that impulse, and she was
      kept silent and motionless by the pressure of opposing needs. Her
      stillness made Deronda at last say,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are too weary. Shall I go away, and come again whenever
      you wish it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Gwendolen&mdash;the dread of his leaving her
      bringing back her power of speech. She went on with her low-toned
      eagerness, &ldquo;I want to tell you what it was that came over me in that
      boat. I was full of rage at being obliged to go&mdash;full of rage&mdash;and
      I could do nothing but sit there like a galley slave. And then we got away&mdash;out
      of the port&mdash;into the deep&mdash;and everything was still&mdash;and
      we never looked at each other, only he spoke to order me&mdash;and the
      very light about me seemed to hold me a prisoner and force me to sit as I
      did. It came over me that when I was a child I used to fancy sailing away
      into a world where people were not forced to live with any one they did
      not like&mdash;I did not like my father-in-law to come home. And now, I
      thought, just the opposite had come to me. I had stepped into a boat, and
      my life was a sailing and sailing away&mdash;gliding on and no help&mdash;always
      into solitude with <i>him</i>, away from deliverance. And because I felt
      more helpless than ever, my thoughts went out over worse things&mdash;I
      longed for worse things&mdash;I had cruel wishes&mdash;I fancied
      impossible ways of&mdash;I did not want to die myself; I was afraid of our
      being drowned together. If it had been any use I should have prayed&mdash;I
      should have prayed that something might befall him. I should have prayed
      that he might sink out of my sight and leave me alone. I knew no way of
      killing him there, but I did, I did kill him in my thoughts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank into silence for a minute, submerged by the weight of memory
      which no words could represent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yet, all the while I felt that I was getting more wicked. And
      what had been with me so much, came to me just then&mdash;what you once
      said&mdash;about dreading to increase my wrong-doing and my remorse&mdash;I
      should hope for nothing then. It was all like a writing of fire within me.
      Getting wicked was misery&mdash;being shut out forever from knowing what
      you&mdash;what better lives were. That had always been coming back to me
      then&mdash;but yet with a despair&mdash;a feeling that it was no use&mdash;evil
      wishes were too strong. I remember then letting go the tiller and saying
      &lsquo;God help me!&rsquo; But then I was forced to take it again and go
      on; and the evil longings, the evil prayers came again and blotted
      everything else dim, till, in the midst of them&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
      how it was&mdash;he was turning the sail&mdash;there was a gust&mdash;he
      was struck&mdash;I know nothing&mdash;I only know that I saw my wish
      outside me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to speak more hurriedly, and in more of a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him sink, and my heart gave a leap as if it were going out of
      me. I think I did not move. I kept my hands tight. It was long enough for
      me to be glad, and yet to think it was no use&mdash;he would come up
      again. And he <i>was</i> come&mdash;farther off&mdash;the boat had moved.
      It was all like lightning. &lsquo;The rope!&rsquo; he called out in a
      voice&mdash;not his own&mdash;I hear it now&mdash;and I stooped for the
      rope&mdash;I felt I must&mdash;I felt sure he could swim, and he would
      come back whether or not, and I dreaded him. That was in my mind&mdash;he
      would come back. But he was gone down again, and I had the rope in my hand&mdash;no,
      there he was again&mdash;his face above the water&mdash;and he cried again&mdash;and
      I held my hand, and my heart said, &lsquo;Die!&rsquo;&mdash;and he sank;
      and I felt &lsquo;It is done&mdash;I am wicked, I am lost!&mdash;and I had
      the rope in my hand&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I thought&mdash;I was
      leaping away from myself&mdash;I would have saved him then. I was leaping
      from my crime, and there it was&mdash;close to me as I fell&mdash;there
      was the dead face&mdash;dead, dead. It can never be altered. That was what
      happened. That was what I did. You know it all. It can never be altered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank back in her chair, exhausted with the agitation of memory and
      speech. Deronda felt the burden on his spirit less heavy than the
      foregoing dread. The word &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; had held a possibility of
      interpretations worse than the fact; and Gwendolen&rsquo;s confession, for
      the very reason that her conscience made her dwell on the determining
      power of her evil thoughts, convinced him the more that there had been
      throughout a counterbalancing struggle of her better will. It seemed
      almost certain that her murderous thought had had no outward effect&mdash;that,
      quite apart from it, the death was inevitable. Still, a question as to the
      outward effectiveness of a criminal desire dominant enough to impel even a
      momentary act, cannot alter our judgment of the desire; and Deronda shrank
      from putting that question forward in the first instance. He held it
      likely that Gwendolen&rsquo;s remorse aggravated her inward guilt, and
      that she gave the character of decisive action to what had been an
      inappreciably instantaneous glance of desire. But her remorse was the
      precious sign of a recoverable nature; it was the culmination of that
      self-disapproval which had been the awakening of a new life within her; it
      marked her off from the criminals whose only regret is failure in securing
      their evil wish. Deronda could not utter one word to diminish that sacred
      aversion to her worst self&mdash;that thorn-pressure which must come with
      the crowning of the sorrowful better, suffering because of the worse. All
      this mingled thought and feeling kept him silent; speech was too momentous
      to be ventured on rashly. There were no words of comfort that did not
      carry some sacrilege. If he had opened his lips to speak, he could only
      have echoed, &ldquo;It can never be altered&mdash;it remains unaltered, to
      alter other things.&rdquo; But he was silent and motionless&mdash;he did
      not know how long&mdash;before he turned to look at her, and saw her sunk
      back with closed eyes, like a lost, weary, storm-beaten white doe, unable
      to rise and pursue its unguided way. He rose and stood before her. The
      movement touched her consciousness, and she opened her eyes with a slight
      quivering that seemed like fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must rest now. Try to rest: try to sleep. And may I see you
      again this evening&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;when you have had some rest? Let
      us say no more now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears came, and she could not answer except by a slight movement of
      the head. Deronda rang for attendance, spoke urgently of the necessity
      that she should be got to rest, and then left her.

      CHAPTER LVII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;The unripe grape, the ripe, and the dried. All things are changes,
    not into nothing, but into that which is not at present.&rdquo;&mdash;MARCUS
    AURELIUS.

    Deeds are the pulse of Time, his beating life,
    And righteous or unrighteous, being done,
    Must throb in after-throbs till Time itself
    Be laid in darkness, and the universe
    Quiver and breathe upon no mirror more.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the evening she sent for him again. It was already near the hour at
      which she had been brought in from the sea the evening before, and the
      light was subdued enough with blinds drawn up and windows open. She was
      seated gazing fixedly on the sea, resting her cheek on her hand, looking
      less shattered than when he had left her, but with a deep melancholy in
      her expression which as Deronda approached her passed into an anxious
      timidity. She did not put out her hand, but said, &ldquo;How long ago it
      is!&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;Will you sit near me again a little while?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed himself by her side as he had done before, and seeing that she
      turned to him with that indefinable expression which implies a wish to say
      something, he waited for her to speak. But again she looked toward the
      window silently, and again turned with the same expression, which yet did
      not issue in speech. There was some fear hindering her, and Deronda,
      wishing to relieve her timidity, averted his face. Presently he heard her
      cry imploringly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not say that any one else should know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most decidedly not,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;There is no action
      that ought to be taken in consequence. There is no injury that could be
      righted in that way. There is no retribution that any mortal could
      apportion justly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so still during a pause that she seemed to be holding her breath
      before she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I had not had that murderous will&mdash;that moment&mdash;if
      I had thrown the rope on the instant&mdash;perhaps it would have hindered
      death?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I think not,&rdquo; said Deronda, slowly. &ldquo;If it
      were true that he could swim, he must have been seized with cramp. With
      your quickest, utmost effort, it seems impossible that you could have done
      anything to save him. That momentary murderous will cannot, I think, have
      altered the course of events. Its effect is confined to the motives in
      your own breast. Within ourselves our evil will is momentous, and sooner
      or later it works its way outside us&mdash;it may be in the vitiation that
      breeds evil acts, but also it may be in the self-abhorrence that stings us
      into better striving.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am saved from robbing others&mdash;there are others&mdash;they
      will have everything&mdash;they will have what they ought to have. I knew
      that some time before I left town. You do not suspect me of wrong desires
      about those things?&rdquo; She spoke hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not thought of them,&rdquo; said Deronda; &ldquo;I was
      thinking too much of the other things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t quite know the beginning of it all,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, slowly, as if she were overcoming her reluctance. &ldquo;There
      was some one else he ought to have married. And I knew it, and I told her
      I would not hinder it. And I went away&mdash;that was when you first saw
      me. But then we became poor all at once, and I was very miserable, and I
      was tempted. I thought, &lsquo;I shall do as I like and make everything
      right.&rsquo; I persuaded myself. And it was all different. It was all
      dreadful. Then came hatred and wicked thoughts. That was how it all came.
      I told you I was afraid of myself. And I did what you told me&mdash;I did
      try to make my fear a safeguard. I thought of what would be if I&mdash;I
      felt what would come&mdash;how I should dread the morning&mdash;wishing it
      would be always night&mdash;and yet in the darkness always seeing
      something&mdash;seeing death. If you did not know how miserable I was, you
      might&mdash;but now it has all been no use. I can care for nothing but
      saving the rest from knowing&mdash;poor mamma, who has never been happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence again before she said with a repressed sob&mdash;&ldquo;You
      cannot bear to look at me any more. You think I am too wicked. You do not
      believe that I can become any better&mdash;worth anything&mdash;worthy
      enough&mdash;I shall always be too wicked to&mdash;&rdquo; The voice broke
      off helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda&rsquo;s heart was pierced. He turned his eyes on her poor
      beseeching face and said, &ldquo;I believe that you may become worthier
      than you have ever yet been&mdash;worthy to lead a life that may be a
      blessing. No evil dooms us hopelessly except the evil we love, and desire
      to continue in, and make no effort to escape from. You <i>have</i> made
      efforts&mdash;you will go on making them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you were the beginning of them. You must not forsake me,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, leaning with her clasped hands on the arm of her chair and
      looking at him, while her face bore piteous traces of the life-experience
      concentrated in the twenty-four hours&mdash;that new terrible life lying
      on the other side of the deed which fulfills a criminal desire. &ldquo;I
      will bear any penance. I will lead any life you tell me. But you must not
      forsake me. You must be near. If you had been near me&mdash;if I could
      have said everything to you, I should have been different. You will not
      forsake me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could never be my impulse to forsake you,&rdquo; said Deronda
      promptly, with that voice which, like his eyes, had the unintentional
      effect of making his ready sympathy seem more personal and special than it
      really was. And in that moment he was not himself quite free from a
      foreboding of some such self-committing effect. His strong feeling for
      this stricken creature could not hinder rushing images of future
      difficulty. He continued to meet her appealing eyes as he spoke, but it
      was with the painful consciousness that to her ear his words might carry a
      promise which one day would seem unfulfilled: he was making an indefinite
      promise to an indefinite hope. Anxieties, both immediate and distant,
      crowded on his thought, and it was under their influence that, after a
      moment&rsquo;s silence, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect Sir Hugo Mallinger to arrive by to-morrow night at least;
      and I am not without hope that Mrs. Davilow may shortly follow him. Her
      presence will be the greatest comfort to you&mdash;it will give you a
      motive to save her from unnecessary pain?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;I will try. And you will not go away?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till after Sir Hugo has come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we shall all go to England?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as possible,&rdquo; said Deronda, not wishing to enter into
      particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen looked toward the window again with an expression which seemed
      like a gradual awakening to new thoughts. The twilight was perceptibly
      deepening, but Deronda could see a movement in her eyes and hands such as
      accompanies a return of perception in one who has been stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will always be with Sir Hugo now!&rdquo; she said presently,
      looking at him. &ldquo;You will always live at the Abbey&mdash;or else at
      Diplow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite uncertain where I shall live,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      coloring.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was warned by his changed color that she had spoken too rashly, and
      fell silent. After a little while she began, again looking away,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible to think how my life will go on. I think now it
      would be better for me to be poor and obliged to work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New promptings will come as the days pass. When you are among your
      friends again, you will discern new duties,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;Make
      it a task now to get as well and calm&mdash;as much like yourself as you
      can, before&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before my mother comes,&rdquo; said Gwendolen. &ldquo;Ah! I must be
      changed. I have not looked at myself. Should you have known me,&rdquo; she
      added, turning toward him, &ldquo;if you had met me now?&mdash;should you
      have known me for the one you saw at Leubronn?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I should have known you,&rdquo; said Deronda, mournfully.
      &ldquo;The outside change is not great. I should have seen at once that it
      was you, and that you had gone through some great sorrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wish now that you had never seen me; don&rsquo;t wish
      that,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, imploringly, while the tears gathered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should despise myself for wishing it,&rdquo; said Deronda.
      &ldquo;How could I know what I was wishing? We must find our duties in
      what comes to us, not in what we imagine might have been. If I took to
      foolish wishing of that sort, I should wish&mdash;not that I had never
      seen you, but that I had been able to save you from this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have saved me from worse,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, in a sobbing
      voice. &ldquo;I should have been worse if it had not been for you. If you
      had not been good, I should have been more wicked than I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be better for me to go now,&rdquo; said Deronda, worn in
      spirit by the perpetual strain of this scene. &ldquo;Remember what we said
      of your task&mdash;to get well and calm before other friends come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose as he spoke, and she gave him her hand submissively. But when he
      had left her she sank on her knees, in hysterical crying. The distance
      between them was too great. She was a banished soul&mdash;beholding a
      possible life which she had sinned herself away from.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was found in this way, crushed on the floor. Such grief seemed natural
      in a poor lady whose husband had been drowned in her presence.

  &ldquo;Much adoe there was, God wot;
  He wold love and she wold not.&rdquo;
                    &mdash;NICHOLAS BRETON.
</pre>
    <p>
      Extension, we know, is a very imperfect measure of things; and the length
      of the sun&rsquo;s journeying can no more tell us how life has advanced
      than the acreage of a field can tell us what growths may be active within
      it. A man may go south, and, stumbling over a bone, may meditate upon it
      till he has found a new starting-point for anatomy; or eastward, and
      discover a new key to language telling a new story of races; or he may
      head an expedition that opens new continental pathways, get himself maimed
      in body, and go through a whole heroic poem of resolve and endurance; and
      at the end of a few months he may come back to find his neighbors
      grumbling at the same parish grievance as before, or to see the same
      elderly gentleman treading the pavement in discourse with himself, shaking
      his head after the same percussive butcher&rsquo;s boy, and pausing at the
      same shop-window to look at the same prints. If the swiftest thinking has
      about the pace of a greyhound, the slowest must be supposed to move, like
      the limpet, by an apparent sticking, which after a good while is discerned
      to be a slight progression. Such differences are manifest in the variable
      intensity which we call human experience, from the revolutionary rush of
      change which makes a new inner and outer life, to that quiet recurrence of
      the familiar, which has no other epochs than those of hunger and the
      heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of this contrast was seen in the year&rsquo;s experience which
      had turned the brilliant, self-confident Gwendolen Harleth of the Archery
      Meeting into the crushed penitent impelled to confess her unworthiness
      where it would have been her happiness to be held worthy; while it had
      left her family in Pennicote without deeper change than that of some
      outward habits, and some adjustment of prospects and intentions to reduced
      income, fewer visits, and fainter compliments. The rectory was as pleasant
      a home as before: and the red and pink peonies on the lawn, the rows of
      hollyhocks by the hedges, had bloomed as well this year as last: the
      rector maintained his cheerful confidence in the good will of patrons and
      his resolution to deserve it by diligence in the fulfillment of his
      duties, whether patrons were likely to hear of it or not; doing nothing
      solely with an eye to promotion except, perhaps, the writing of two
      ecclesiastical articles, which having no signature, were attributed to
      some one else, except by the patrons who had a special copy sent them, and
      these certainly knew the author but did not read the articles. The rector,
      however, chewed no poisonous cud of suspicion on this point: he made
      marginal notes on his own copies to render them a more interesting loan,
      and was gratified that the Archdeacon and other authorities had nothing to
      say against the general tenor of his argument. Peaceful authorship!&mdash;living
      in the air of the fields and downs, and not in the thrice-breathed breath
      of criticism&mdash;bringing no Dantesque leanness; rather, assisting
      nutrition by complacency, and perhaps giving a more suffusive sense of
      achievement than the production of a whole <i>Divina Commedia</i>. Then
      there was the father&rsquo;s recovered delight in his favorite son, which
      was a happiness outweighing the loss of eighteen hundred a year. Of
      whatever nature might be the hidden change wrought in Rex by the
      disappointment of his first love, it was apparently quite secondary to
      that evidence of more serious ambition which dated from the family
      misfortune; indeed, Mr. Gascoigne was inclined to regard the little affair
      which had caused him so much anxiety the year before as an evaporation of
      superfluous moisture, a kind of finish to the baking process which the
      human dough demands. Rex had lately come down for a summer visit to the
      rectory, bringing Anna home, and while he showed nearly the old liveliness
      with his brothers and sisters, he continued in his holiday the habits of
      the eager student, rising early in the morning and shutting himself up
      early in the evenings to carry on a fixed course of study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t repent the choice of the law as a profession, Rex?&rdquo;
      said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no profession I would choose before it,&rdquo; said Rex.
      &ldquo;I should like to end my life as a first-rate judge, and help to
      draw up a code. I reverse the famous dictum. I should say, &lsquo;Give me
      something to do with making the laws, and let who will make the songs.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to stow in an immense amount of rubbish, I suppose&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the worst of it,&rdquo; said the rector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that law-rubbish is worse than any other sort. It
      is not so bad as the rubbishy literature that people choke their minds
      with. It doesn&rsquo;t make one so dull. Our wittiest men have often been
      lawyers. Any orderly way of looking at things as cases and evidence seems
      to me better than a perpetual wash of odds and ends bearing on nothing in
      particular. And then, from a higher point of view, the foundations and the
      growth of law make the most interesting aspects of philosophy and history.
      Of course there will be a good deal that is troublesome, drudging, perhaps
      exasperating. But the great prizes in life can&rsquo;t be won easily&mdash;I
      see that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my boy, the best augury of a man&rsquo;s success in his
      profession is that he thinks it the finest in the world. But I fancy it so
      with most work when a man goes into it with a will. Brewitt, the
      blacksmith, said to me the other day that his &lsquo;prentice had no mind
      to his trade; &lsquo;and yet, sir,&rsquo; said Brewitt, &lsquo;what would
      a young fellow have if he doesn&rsquo;t like the blacksmithing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector cherished a fatherly delight, which he allowed to escape him
      only in moderation. Warham, who had gone to India, he had easily borne
      parting with, but Rex was that romance of later life which a man sometimes
      finds in a son whom he recognizes as superior to himself, picturing a
      future eminence for him according to a variety of famous examples. It was
      only to his wife that he said with decision: &ldquo;Rex will be a
      distinguished man, Nancy, I am sure of it&mdash;as sure as Paley&rsquo;s
      father was about his son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Paley an old bachelor?&rdquo; said Mrs. Gascoigne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is hardly to the point, my dear,&rdquo; said the rector, who
      did not remember that irrelevant detail. And Mrs. Gascoigne felt that she
      had spoken rather weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This quiet trotting of time at the rectory was shared by the group who had
      exchanged the faded dignity of Offendene for the low white house not a
      mile off, well enclosed with evergreens, and known to the villagers, as
      &ldquo;Jodson&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Mrs. Davilow&rsquo;s delicate face showed
      only a slight deepening of its mild melancholy, her hair only a few more
      silver lines, in consequence of the last year&rsquo;s trials; the four
      girls had bloomed out a little from being less in the shade; and the good
      Jocosa preserved her serviceable neutrality toward the pleasures and
      glories of the world as things made for those who were not &ldquo;in a
      situation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The low narrow drawing-room, enlarged by two quaint projecting windows,
      with lattices wide open on a July afternoon to the scent of monthly roses,
      the faint murmurs of the garden, and the occasional rare sound of hoofs
      and wheels seeming to clarify the succeeding silence, made rather a
      crowded, lively scene, Rex and Anna being added to the usual group of six.
      Anna, always a favorite with her younger cousins, had much to tell of her
      new experience, and the acquaintances she had made in London, and when on
      her first visit she came alone, many questions were asked her about
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s house in Grosvenor Square, what Gwendolen herself had
      said, and what any one else had said about Gwendolen. Had Anna been to see
      Gwendolen after she had known about the yacht? No:&mdash;an answer which
      left speculation free concerning everything connected with that
      interesting unknown vessel beyond the fact that Gwendolen had written just
      before she set out to say that Mr. Grandcourt and she were going yachting
      on the Mediterranean, and again from Marseilles to say that she was sure
      to like the yachting, the cabins were very elegant, and she would probably
      not send another letter till she had written quite a long diary filled
      with <i>dittos</i>. Also, this movement of Mr. and Mrs. Grandcourt had
      been mentioned in &ldquo;the newspaper;&rdquo; so that altogether this new
      phase of Gwendolen&rsquo;s exalted life made a striking part of the
      sisters&rsquo; romance, the book-devouring Isabel throwing in a corsair or
      two to make an adventure that might end well.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Rex was present, the girls, according to instructions, never
      started this fascinating topic, and to-day there had only been animated
      descriptions of the Meyricks and their extraordinary Jewish friends, which
      caused some astonished questioning from minds to which the idea of live
      Jews, out of a book, suggested a difference deep enough to be almost
      zoological, as of a strange race in Pliny&rsquo;s Natural History that
      might sleep under the shade of its own ears. Bertha could not imagine what
      Jews believed now; and she had a dim idea that they rejected the Old
      Testament since it proved the New; Miss Merry thought that Mirah and her
      brother could &ldquo;never have been properly argued with,&rdquo; and the
      amiable Alice did not mind what the Jews believed, she was sure she
      &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t bear them.&rdquo; Mrs. Davilow corrected her by
      saying that the great Jewish families who were in society were quite what
      they ought to be both in London and Paris, but admitted that the commoner
      unconverted Jews were objectionable; and Isabel asked whether Mirah talked
      just as they did, or whether you might be with her and not find out that
      she was a Jewess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rex, who had no partisanship with the Israelites, having made a
      troublesome acquaintance with the minutiae of their ancient history in the
      form of &ldquo;cram,&rdquo; was amusing himself by playfully exaggerating
      the notion of each speaker, while Anna begged them all to understand that
      he was only joking, when the laughter was interrupted by the bringing in
      of a letter for Mrs. Davilow. A messenger had run with it in great haste
      from the rectory. It enclosed a telegram, and as Mrs. Davilow read and
      re-read it in silence and agitation, all eyes were turned on her with
      anxiety, but no one dared to speak. Looking up at last and seeing the
      young faces &ldquo;painted with fear,&rdquo; she remembered that they
      might be imagining something worse than the truth, something like her own
      first dread which made her unable to understand what was written, and she
      said, with a sob which was half relief,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dears, Mr. Grandcourt&mdash;&rdquo; She paused an instant, and
      then began again, &ldquo;Mr. Grandcourt is drowned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rex started up as if a missile had been suddenly thrown into the room. He
      could not help himself, and Anna&rsquo;s first look was at him. But then,
      gathering some self-command while Mrs. Davilow was reading what the rector
      had written on the enclosing paper, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I do anything, aunt? Can I carry any word to my father from
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear. Tell him I will be ready&mdash;he is very good. He says
      he will go with me to Genoa&mdash;he will be here at half-past six. Jocosa
      and Alice, help me to get ready. She is safe&mdash;Gwendolen is safe&mdash;but
      she must be ill. I am sure she must be very ill. Rex, dear&mdash;Rex and
      Anna&mdash;go and and tell your father I will be quite ready. I would not
      for the world lose another night. And bless him for being ready so soon. I
      can travel night and day till we get there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rex and Anna hurried away through the sunshine which was suddenly solemn
      to them, without uttering a word to each other: she chiefly possessed by
      solicitude about any reopening of his wound, he struggling with a
      tumultuary crowd of thoughts that were an offence against his better will.
      The tumult being undiminished when they were at the rectory gate, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nannie, I will leave you to say everything to my father. If he
      wants me immediately, let me know. I shall stay in the shrubbery for ten
      minutes&mdash;only ten minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Who has been quite free from egoistic escapes of the imagination,
      picturing desirable consequences on his own future in the presence of
      another&rsquo;s misfortune, sorrow, or death? The expected promotion or
      legacy is the common type of a temptation which makes speech and even
      prayer a severe avoidance of the most insistent thoughts, and sometimes
      raises an inward shame, a self-distaste that is worse than any other form
      of unpleasant companionship. In Rex&rsquo;s nature the shame was
      immediate, and overspread like an ugly light all the hurrying images of
      what might come, which thrust themselves in with the idea that Gwendolen
      was again free&mdash;overspread them, perhaps, the more persistently
      because every phantasm of a hope was quickly nullified by a more
      substantial obstacle. Before the vision of &ldquo;Gwendolen free&rdquo;
      rose the impassable vision of &ldquo;Gwendolen rich, exalted, courted;&rdquo;
      and if in the former time, when both their lives were fresh, she had
      turned from his love with repugnance, what ground was there for supposing
      that her heart would be more open to him in the future?
    </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts, which he wanted to master and suspend, were like a
      tumultuary ringing of opposing chimes that he could not escape from by
      running. During the last year he had brought himself into a state of calm
      resolve, and now it seemed that three words had been enough to undo all
      that difficult work, and cast him back into the wretched fluctuations of a
      longing which he recognized as simply perturbing and hopeless. And at this
      moment the activity of such longing had an untimeliness that made it
      repulsive to his better self. Excuse poor Rex; it was not much more than
      eighteen months since he had been laid low by an archer who sometimes
      touches his arrow with a subtle, lingering poison. The disappointment of a
      youthful passion has effects as incalculable as those of small-pox which
      may make one person plain and a genius, another less plain and more
      foolish, another plain without detriment to his folly, and leave perhaps
      the majority without obvious change. Everything depends&mdash;not on the
      mere fact of disappointment, but&mdash;on the nature affected and the
      force that stirs it. In Rex&rsquo;s well-endowed nature, brief as the hope
      had been, the passionate stirring had gone deep, and the effect of
      disappointment was revolutionary, though fraught with a beneficent new
      order which retained most of the old virtues; in certain respects he
      believed that it had finally determined the bias and color of his life.
      Now, however, it seemed that his inward peace was hardly more than that of
      republican Florence, and his heart no better than the alarm-bell that made
      work slack and tumult busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rex&rsquo;s love had been of that sudden, penetrating, clinging sort which
      the ancients knew and sung, and in singing made a fashion of talk for many
      moderns whose experience has by no means a fiery, demonic character. To
      have the consciousness suddenly steeped with another&rsquo;s personality,
      to have the strongest inclinations possessed by an image which retains its
      dominance in spite of change and apart from worthiness&mdash;nay, to feel
      a passion which clings faster for the tragic pangs inflicted by a cruel,
      reorganized unworthiness&mdash;is a phase of love which in the feeble and
      common-minded has a repulsive likeness to his blind animalism insensible
      to the higher sway of moral affinity or heaven-lit admiration. But when
      this attaching force is present in a nature not of brutish
      unmodifiableness, but of a human dignity that can risk itself safely, it
      may even result in a devotedness not unfit to be called divine in a higher
      sense than the ancient. Phlegmatic rationality stares and shakes its head
      at these unaccountable prepossessions, but they exist as undeniably as the
      winds and waves, determining here a wreck and there a triumphant voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sort of passion had nested in the sweet-natured, strong Rex, and he
      had made up his mind to its companionship, as if it had been an object
      supremely dear, stricken dumb and helpless, and turning all the future of
      tenderness into a shadow of the past. But he had also made up his mind
      that his life was not to be pauperized because he had had to renounce one
      sort of joy; rather, he had begun life again with a new counting-up of the
      treasures that remained to him, and he had even felt a release of power
      such as may come from ceasing to be afraid of your own neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, here he was pacing the shrubbery, angry with himself that the
      sense of irrevocableness in his lot, which ought in reason to have been as
      strong as ever, had been shaken by a change of circumstances that could
      make no change in relation to him. He told himself the truth quite
      roughly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would never love me; and that is not the question&mdash;I could
      never approach her as a lover in her present position. I am exactly of no
      consequence at all, and am not likely to be of much consequence till my
      head is turning gray. But what has that to do with it? She would not have
      me on any terms, and I would not ask her. It is a meanness to be thinking
      about it now&mdash;no better than lurking about the battle-field to strip
      the dead; but there never was more gratuitous sinning. I have nothing to
      gain there&mdash;absolutely nothing. Then why can&rsquo;t I face the
      facts, and behave as they demand, instead of leaving my father to suppose
      that there are matters he can&rsquo;t speak to me about, though I might be
      useful in them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The last thought made one wave with the impulse that sent Rex walking
      firmly into the house and through the open door of the study, where he saw
      his father packing a traveling-desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I be of any use, sir?&rdquo; said Rex, with rallied courage, as
      his father looked up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy; when I&rsquo;m gone, just see to my letters, and
      answer where necessary, and send me word of everything. Dymock will manage
      the parish very well, and you will stay with your mother, or, at least, go
      up and down again, till I come back, whenever that may be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will hardly be very long, sir, I suppose,&rdquo; said Rex,
      beginning to strap a railway rug. &ldquo;You will perhaps bring my cousin
      back to England?&rdquo; He forced himself to speak of Gwendolen for the
      first time, and the rector noticed the epoch with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; he answered, taking the subject as a
      matter-of-course between them. &ldquo;Perhaps her mother may stay there
      with her, and I may come back very soon. This telegram leaves us in
      ignorance which is rather anxious. But no doubt the arrangements of the
      will lately made are satisfactory, and there may possibly be an heir yet
      to be born. In any case, I feel confident that Gwendolen will be liberally&mdash;I
      should expect, splendidly&mdash;provided for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been a great shock for her,&rdquo; said Rex, getting
      more resolute after the first twinge had been borne. &ldquo;I suppose he
      was a devoted husband.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt of it,&rdquo; said the rector, in his most decided manner.
      &ldquo;Few men of his position would have come forward as he did under the
      circumstances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rex had never seen Grandcourt, had never been spoken to about him by any
      one of the family, and knew nothing of Gwendolen&rsquo;s flight from her
      suitor to Leubronn. He only knew that Grandcourt, being very much in love
      with her, had made her an offer in the first weeks of her sudden poverty,
      and had behaved very handsomely in providing for her mother and sisters.
      That was all very natural and what Rex himself would have liked to do.
      Grandcourt had been a lucky fellow, and had had some happiness before he
      got drowned. Yet Rex wondered much whether Gwendolen had been in love with
      the successful suitor, or had only forborne to tell him that she hated
      being made love to.

      CHAPTER LIX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I count myself in nothing else so happy
  As in a soul remembering my good friends.&rdquo;
                                   &mdash;SHAKESPEARE.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sir Hugo Mallinger was not so prompt in starting for Genoa as Mr.
      Gascoigne had been, and Deronda on all accounts would not take his
      departure until he had seen the baronet. There was not only Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      death, but also the late crisis in his own life to make reasons why his
      oldest friend would desire to have the unrestrained communication of
      speech with him, for in writing he had not felt able to give any details
      concerning the mother who had come and gone like an apparition. It was not
      till the fifth evening that Deronda, according to telegram, waited for Sir
      Hugo at the station, where he was to arrive between eight and nine; and
      while he was looking forward to the sight of the kind, familiar face,
      which was part of his earliest memories, something like a smile, in spite
      of his late tragic experience, might have been detected in his eyes and
      the curve of his lips at the idea of Sir Hugo&rsquo;s pleasure in being
      now master of his estates, able to leave them to his daughters, or at
      least&mdash;according to a view of inheritance which had just been
      strongly impressed on Deronda&rsquo;s imagination&mdash;to take makeshift
      feminine offspring as intermediate to a satisfactory heir in a grandson.
      We should be churlish creatures if we could have no joy in our
      fellow-mortals&rsquo; joy, unless it were in agreement with our theory of
      righteous distribution and our highest ideal of human good: what sour
      corners our mouths would get&mdash;our eyes, what frozen glances! and all
      the while our own possessions and desires would not exactly adjust
      themselves to our ideal. We must have some comradeship with imperfection;
      and it is, happily, possible to feel gratitude even where we discern a
      mistake that may have been injurious, the vehicle of the mistake being an
      affectionate intention prosecuted through a life-time of kindly offices.
      Deronda&rsquo;s feeling and judgment were strongly against the action of
      Sir Hugo in making himself the agent of a falsity&mdash;yes, a falsity: he
      could give no milder name to the concealment under which he had been
      reared. But the baronet had probably had no clear knowledge concerning the
      mother&rsquo;s breach of trust, and with his light, easy way of taking
      life, had held it a reasonable preference in her that her son should be
      made an English gentleman, seeing that she had the eccentricity of not
      caring to part from her child, and be to him as if she were not. Daniel&rsquo;s
      affectionate gratitude toward Sir Hugo made him wish to find grounds of
      excuse rather than blame; for it is as possible to be rigid in principle
      and tender in blame, as it is to suffer from the sight of things hung
      awry, and yet to be patient with the hanger who sees amiss. If Sir Hugo in
      his bachelorhood had been beguiled into regarding children chiefly as a
      product intended to make life more agreeable to the full-grown, whose
      convenience alone was to be consulted in the disposal of them&mdash;why,
      he had shared an assumption which, if not formally avowed, was massively
      acted on at that date of the world&rsquo;s history; and Deronda, with all
      his keen memory of the painful inward struggle he had gone through in his
      boyhood, was able also to remember the many signs that his experience had
      been entirely shut out from Sir Hugo&rsquo;s conception. Ignorant kindness
      may have the effect of cruelty; but to be angry with it as if it were
      direct cruelty would be an ignorant <i>un</i>kindness, the most remote
      from Deronda&rsquo;s large imaginative lenience toward others. And perhaps
      now, after the searching scenes of the last ten days, in which the curtain
      had been lifted for him from the secrets of lives unlike his own, he was
      more than ever disposed to check that rashness of indignation or
      resentment which has an unpleasant likeness to the love of punishing. When
      he saw Sir Hugo&rsquo;s familiar figure descending from the railway
      carriage, the life-long affection which had been well accustomed to make
      excuses, flowed in and submerged all newer knowledge that might have
      seemed fresh ground for blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Dan,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, with a serious fervor, grasping
      Deronda&rsquo;s hand. He uttered no other words of greeting; there was too
      strong a rush of mutual consciousness. The next thing was to give orders
      to the courier, and then to propose walking slowly in the mild evening,
      there being no hurry to get to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have taken my journey easily, and am in excellent condition,&rdquo;
      he said, as he and Deronda came out under the starlight, which was still
      faint with the lingering sheen of day. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hurry in
      setting off, because I wanted to inquire into things a little, and so I
      got sight of your letter to Lady Mallinger before I started. But now, how
      is the widow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting calmer,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;She seems to be
      escaping the bodily illness that one might have feared for her, after her
      plunge and terrible excitement. Her uncle and mother came two days ago,
      and she is being well taken care of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any prospect of an heir being born?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what Mr. Gascoigne said to me, I conclude not. He spoke as if
      it were a question whether the widow would have the estates for her life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not be much of a wrench to her affections, I fancy, this
      loss of the husband?&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, looking round at Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The suddenness of the death has been a great blow to her,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, quietly evading the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether Grandcourt gave her any notion what were the
      provisions of his will?&rdquo; said Sir Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what they are, sir?&rdquo; parried Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said the baronet, quickly. &ldquo;Gad! if there
      is no prospect of a legitimate heir, he has left everything to a boy he
      had by a Mrs. Glasher; you know nothing about the affair, I suppose, but
      she was a sort of wife to him for a good many years, and there are three
      older children&mdash;girls. The boy is to take his father&rsquo;s name; he
      is Henleigh already, and he is to be Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt. The
      Mallinger will be of no use to him, I am happy to say; but the young dog
      will have more than enough with his fourteen years&rsquo; minority&mdash;no
      need to have had holes filled up with my fifty thousand for Diplow that he
      had no right to: and meanwhile my beauty, the young widow, is to put up
      with a poor two thousand a year and the house at Gadsmere&mdash;a nice
      kind of banishment for her if she chose to shut herself up there, which I
      don&rsquo;t think she will. The boy&rsquo;s mother has been living there
      of late years. I&rsquo;m perfectly disgusted with Grandcourt. I don&rsquo;t
      know that I&rsquo;m obliged to think the better of him because he&rsquo;s
      drowned, though, so far as my affairs are concerned, nothing in his life
      became him like the leaving it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion he did wrong when he married this wife&mdash;not in
      leaving his estates to the son,&rdquo; said Deronda, rather dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say nothing against his leaving the land to the lad,&rdquo; said
      Sir Hugo; &ldquo;but since he had married this girl he ought to have given
      her a handsome provision, such as she could live on in a style fitted to
      the rank he had raised her to. She ought to have had four or five thousand
      a year and the London house for her life; that&rsquo;s what I should have
      done for her. I suppose, as she was penniless, her friends couldn&rsquo;t
      stand out for a settlement, else it&rsquo;s ill trusting to the will a man
      may make after he&rsquo;s married. Even a wise man generally lets some
      folly ooze out of him in his will&mdash;my father did, I know; and if a
      fellow has any spite or tyranny in him, he&rsquo;s likely to bottle off a
      good deal for keeping in that sort of document. It&rsquo;s quite clear
      Grandcourt meant that his death should put an extinguisher on his wife, if
      she bore him no heir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, in the other case, I suppose everything would have been
      reversed&mdash;illegitimacy would have had the extinguisher?&rdquo; said
      Deronda, with some scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely&mdash;Gadsmere and the two thousand. It&rsquo;s queer.
      One nuisance is that Grandcourt has made me an executor; but seeing he was
      the son of my only brother, I can&rsquo;t refuse to act. And I shall mind
      it less if I can be of any use to the widow. Lush thinks she was not in
      ignorance about the family under the rose, and the purport of the will. He
      hints that there was no very good understanding between the couple. But I
      fancy you are the man who knew most about what Mrs. Grandcourt felt or did
      not feel&mdash;eh, Dan?&rdquo; Sir Hugo did not put this question with his
      usual jocoseness, but rather with a lowered tone of interested inquiry;
      and Deronda felt that any evasion would be misinterpreted. He answered
      gravely,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was certainly not happy. They were unsuited to each other. But
      as to the disposal of the property&mdash;from all I have seen of her, I
      should predict that she will be quite contented with it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she is not much like the rest of her sex; that&rsquo;s all I
      can say,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, with a slight shrug. &ldquo;However, she
      ought to be something extraordinary, for there must be an entanglement
      between your horoscope and hers&mdash;eh? When that tremendous telegram
      came, the first thing Lady Mallinger said was, &lsquo;How very strange
      that it should be Daniel who sends it!&rsquo; But I have had something of
      the same sort in my own life. I was once at a foreign hotel where a lady
      had been left by her husband without money. When I heard of it, and came
      forward to help her, who should she be but an early flame of mine, who had
      been fool enough to marry an Austrian baron with a long mustache and short
      affection? But it was an affair of my own that called me there&mdash;nothing
      to do with knight-errantry, any more than you coming to Genoa had to do
      with the Grandcourts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a little while. Sir Hugo had begun to talk of the
      Grandcourts as the less difficult subject between himself and Deronda; but
      they were both wishing to overcome a reluctance to perfect frankness on
      the events which touched their relation to each other. Deronda felt that
      his letter, after the first interview with his mother, had been rather a
      thickening than a breaking of the ice, and that he ought to wait for the
      first opening to come from Sir Hugo. Just when they were about to lose
      sight of the port, the baronet turned, and pausing as if to get a last
      view, said in a tone of more serious feeling&mdash;&ldquo;And about the
      main business of your coming to Genoa, Dan? You have not been deeply
      pained by anything you have learned, I hope? There is nothing that you
      feel need change your position in any way? You know, whatever happens to
      you must always be of importance to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desire to meet your goodness by perfect confidence, sir,&rdquo;
      said Deronda. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t answer those questions truly by a
      simple yes or no. Much that I have heard about the past has pained me. And
      it has been a pain to meet and part with my mother in her suffering state,
      as I have been compelled to do. But it is no pain&mdash;it is rather a
      clearing up of doubts for which I am thankful, to know my parentage. As to
      the effect on my position, there will be no change in my gratitude to you,
      sir, for the fatherly care and affection you have always shown me. But to
      know that I was born a Jew, may have a momentous influence on my life,
      which I am hardly able to tell you of at present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda spoke the last sentence with a resolve that overcame some
      diffidence. He felt that the differences between Sir Hugo&rsquo;s nature
      and his own would have, by-and-by, to disclose themselves more markedly
      than had ever yet been needful. The baronet gave him a quick glance, and
      turned to walk on. After a few moments&rsquo; silence, in which he had
      reviewed all the material in his memory which would enable him to
      interpret Deronda&rsquo;s words, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have long expected something remarkable from you, Dan; but, for
      God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t go into any eccentricities! I can tolerate
      any man&rsquo;s difference of opinion, but let him tell it me without
      getting himself up as a lunatic. At this stage of the world, if a man
      wants to be taken seriously, he must keep clear of melodrama. Don&rsquo;t
      misunderstand me. I am not suspecting you of setting up any lunacy on your
      own account. I only think you might easily be led arm in arm with a
      lunatic, especially if he wanted defending. You have a passion for people
      who are pelted, Dan. I&rsquo;m sorry for them too; but so far as company
      goes, it&rsquo;s a bad ground of selection. However, I don&rsquo;t ask you
      to anticipate your inclination in anything you have to tell me. When you
      make up your mind to a course that requires money, I have some sixteen
      thousand pounds that have been accumulating for you over and above what
      you have been having the interest of as income. And now I am come, I
      suppose you want to get back to England as soon as you can?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go first to Mainz to get away a chest of my grandfather&rsquo;s,
      and perhaps to see a friend of his,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;Although
      the chest has been lying there these twenty years, I have an unreasonable
      sort of nervous eagerness to get it away under my care, as if it were more
      likely now than before that something might happen to it. And perhaps I am
      the more uneasy, because I lingered after my mother left, instead of
      setting out immediately. Yet I can&rsquo;t regret that I was here&mdash;else
      Mrs. Grandcourt would have had none but servants to act for her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, with a flippancy which was an
      escape of some vexation hidden under his more serious speech; &ldquo;I
      hope you are not going to set a dead Jew above a living Christian.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda colored, and repressed a retort. They were just turning into the
      <i>Italia</i>.

      CHAPTER LX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;But I shall say no more of this at this time; for this is to be felt
    and not to be talked of; and they who never touched it with their
    fingers may secretly perhaps laugh at it in their hearts and be never
    the wiser.&rdquo;&mdash;JEREMY TAYLOR.

    The Roman Emperor in the legend put to death ten learned Israelites to
    avenge the sale of Joseph by his brethren. And there have always been
    enough of his kidney, whose piety lies in punishing who can see the
    justice of grudges but not of gratitude. For you shall never convince
    the stronger feeling that it hath not the stronger reason, or incline
    him who hath no love to believe that there is good ground for loving.
    As we may learn from the order of word-making, wherein <i>love</i>
    precedeth <i>lovable</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      When Deronda presented his letter at the banking-house in the <i>Schuster
      Strasse</i> at Mainz, and asked for Joseph Kalonymos, he was presently
      shown into an inner room, where, seated at a table arranging open letters,
      was the white-bearded man whom he had seen the year before in the
      synagogue at Frankfort. He wore his hat&mdash;it seemed to be the same old
      felt hat as before&mdash;and near him was a packed portmanteau with a wrap
      and overcoat upon it. On seeing Deronda enter he rose, but did not advance
      or put out his hand. Looking at him with small penetrating eyes which
      glittered like black gems in the midst of his yellowish face and white
      hair, he said in German,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! It is now you who seek me, young man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I seek you with gratitude, as a friend of my grandfather&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, &ldquo;and I am under an obligation to you for giving
      yourself much trouble on my account.&rdquo; He spoke without difficulty in
      that liberal German tongue which takes many strange accents to its
      maternal bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kalonymos now put out his hand and said cordially, &ldquo;So you are no
      longer angry at being something more than an Englishman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary. I thank you heartily for helping to save me from
      remaining in ignorance of my parentage, and for taking care of the chest
      that my grandfather left in trust for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, sit down,&rdquo; said Kalonymos, in a quick undertone,
      seating himself again, and pointing to a chair near him. Then deliberately
      laying aside his hat and showing a head thickly covered, with white hair,
      he stroked and clutched his beard while he looked examiningly at the young
      face before him. The moment wrought strongly on Deronda&rsquo;s
      imaginative susceptibility: in the presence of one linked still in zealous
      friendship with the grandfather whose hope had yearned toward him when he
      was unborn, and who, though dead, was yet to speak with him in those
      written memorials which, says Milton, &ldquo;contain a potency of life in
      them to be as active as that soul whose progeny they are,&rdquo; he seemed
      to himself to be touching the electric chain of his own ancestry; and he
      bore the scrutinizing look of Kalonymos with a delighted awe, something
      like what one feels in the solemn commemoration of acts done long ago but
      still telling markedly on the life of to-day. Impossible for men of duller
      fibre&mdash;men whose affection is not ready to diffuse itself through the
      wide travel of imagination, to comprehend, perhaps even to credit this
      sensibility of Deronda&rsquo;s; but it subsisted, like their own dullness,
      notwithstanding their lack of belief in it&mdash;and it gave his face an
      expression which seemed very satisfactory to the observer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said in Hebrew, quoting from one of the fine hymns in the Hebrew
      liturgy, &ldquo;As thy goodness has been great to the former generations,
      even so may it be to the latter.&rdquo; Then after pausing a little he
      began, &ldquo;Young man, I rejoice that I was not yet set off again on my
      travels, and that you are come in time for me to see the image of my
      friend as he was in his youth&mdash;no longer perverted from the
      fellowship of your people&mdash;no longer shrinking in proud wrath from
      the touch of him who seemed to be claiming you as a Jew. You come with
      thankfulness yourself to claim the kindred and heritage that wicked
      contrivance would have robbed you of. You come with a willing soul to
      declare, &lsquo;I am the grandson of Daniel Charisi.&rsquo; Is it not so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly it is,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;But let me say that I
      should at no time have been inclined to treat a Jew with incivility simply
      because he was a Jew. You can understand that I shrank from saying to a
      stranger, &lsquo;I know nothing of my mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sin, a sin!&rdquo; said Kalonymos, putting up his hand and
      closing his eyes in disgust. &ldquo;A robbery of our people&mdash;as when
      our youths and maidens were reared for the Roman Edom. But it is
      frustrated. I have frustrated it. When Daniel Charisi&mdash;may his Rock
      and his Redeemer guard him!&mdash;when Daniel Charisi was a stripling and
      I was a lad little above his shoulder, we made a solemn vow always to be
      friends. He said, &lsquo;Let us bind ourselves with duty, as if we were
      sons of the same mother.&rsquo; That was his bent from first to last&mdash;as
      he said, to fortify his soul with bonds. It was a saying of his, &lsquo;Let
      us bind love with duty; for duty is the love of law; and law is the nature
      of the Eternal.&rsquo; So we bound ourselves. And though we were much
      apart in our later life, the bond has never been broken. When he was dead,
      they sought to rob him; but they could not rob him of me. I rescued that
      remainder of him which he had prized and preserved for his offspring. And
      I have restored to him the offspring they had robbed him of. I will bring
      you the chest forthwith.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kalonymos left the room for a few minutes, and returned with a clerk who
      carried the chest, set it down on the floor, drew off a leather cover, and
      went out again. It was not very large, but was made heavy by ornamental
      bracers and handles of gilt iron. The wood was beautifully incised with
      Arabic lettering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; said Kalonymos, returning to his seat. &ldquo;And here
      is the curious key,&rdquo; he added, taking it from a small leathern bag.
      &ldquo;Bestow it carefully. I trust you are methodic and wary.&rdquo; He
      gave Deronda the monitory and slightly suspicious look with which age is
      apt to commit any object to the keeping of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be more careful of this than of any other property,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, smiling and putting the key in his breast-pocket. &ldquo;I
      never before possessed anything that was a sign to me of so much cherished
      hope and effort. And I shall never forget that the effort was partly
      yours. Have you time to tell me more of my grandfather? Or shall I be
      trespassing in staying longer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay yet a while. In an hour and eighteen minutes I start for
      Trieste,&rdquo; said Kalonymos, looking at his watch, &ldquo;and presently
      my sons will expect my attention. Will you let me make you known to them,
      so that they may have the pleasure of showing hospitality to my friend&rsquo;s
      grandson? They dwell here in ease and luxury, though I choose to be a
      wanderer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be glad if you will commend me to their acquaintance for
      some future opportunity,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;There are pressing
      claims calling me to England&mdash;friends who may be much in need of my
      presence. I have been kept away from them too long by unexpected
      circumstances. But to know more of you and your family would be motive
      enough to bring me again to Mainz.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Me you will hardly find, for I am beyond my threescore years
      and ten, and I am a wanderer, carrying my shroud with me. But my sons and
      their children dwell here in wealth and unity. The days are changed for us
      since Karl the Great fetched my ancestors from Italy to bring some
      tincture of knowledge to our rough German brethren. I and my
      contemporaries have had to fight for it too. Our youth fell on evil days;
      but this we have won; we increase our wealth in safety, and the learning
      of all Germany is fed and fattened by Jewish brains&mdash;though they keep
      not always their Jewish hearts. Have you been left altogether ignorant of
      your people&rsquo;s life, young man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Deronda, &ldquo;I have lately, before I had any
      true suspicion of my parentage, been led to study everything belonging to
      their history with more interest than any other subject. It turns out that
      I have been making myself ready to understand my grandfather a little.&rdquo;
      He was anxious less the time should be consumed before this circuitous
      course of talk could lead them back to the topic he most cared about. Age
      does not easily distinguish between what it needs to express and what
      youth needs to know&mdash;distance seeming to level the objects of memory;
      and keenly active as Joseph Kalonymos showed himself, an inkstand in the
      wrong place would have hindered his imagination from getting to Beyrout:
      he had been used to unite restless travel with punctilious observation.
      But Deronda&rsquo;s last sentence answered its purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So&mdash;you would perhaps have been such a man as he if your
      education had not hindered; for you are like him in features:&mdash;yet
      not altogether, young man. He had an iron will in his face: it braced up
      everybody about him. When he was quite young he had already got one deep
      upright line in his brow. I see none of that in you. Daniel Charisi used
      to say, &lsquo;Better, a wrong will than a wavering; better a steadfast
      enemy than an uncertain friend; better a false belief than no belief at
      all.&rsquo; What he despised most was indifference. He had longer reasons
      than I can give you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet his knowledge was not narrow?&rdquo; said Deronda, with a tacit
      reference to the usual excuse for indecision&mdash;that it comes from
      knowing too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Narrow? no,&rdquo; said Kalonymos, shaking his head with a
      compassionate smile &ldquo;From his childhood upward, he drank in learning
      as easily as the plant sucks up water. But he early took to medicine and
      theories about life and health. He traveled to many countries, and spent
      much of his substance in seeing and knowing. What he used to insist on was
      that the strength and wealth of mankind depended on the balance of
      separateness and communication, and he was bitterly against our people
      losing themselves among the Gentiles; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no better,&rsquo;
      said he, &lsquo;than the many sorts of grain going back from their variety
      into sameness.&rsquo; He mingled all sorts of learning; and in that he was
      like our Arabic writers in the golden time. We studied together, but he
      went beyond me. Though we were bosom friends, and he poured himself out to
      me, we were as different as the inside and outside of the bowl. I stood up
      for two notions of my own: I took Charisi&rsquo;s sayings as I took the
      shape of the trees: they were there, not to be disputed about. It came to
      the same thing in both of us; we were both faithful Jews, thankful not to
      be Gentiles. And since I was a ripe man, I have been what I am now, for
      all but age&mdash;loving to wander, loving transactions, loving to behold
      all things, and caring nothing about hardship. Charisi thought continually
      of our people&rsquo;s future: he went with all his soul into that part of
      our religion: I, not. So we have freedom, I am content. Our people
      wandered before they were driven. Young man when I am in the East, I lie
      much on deck and watch the greater stars. The sight of them satisfies me.
      I know them as they rise, and hunger not to know more. Charisi was
      satisfied with no sight, but pieced it out with what had been before and
      what would come after. Yet we loved each other, and as he said, he bound
      our love with duty; we solemnly pledged ourselves to help and defend each
      other to the last. I have fulfilled my pledge.&rdquo; Here Kalonymos rose,
      and Deronda, rising also, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in being faithful to him you have caused justice to be done to
      me. It would have been a robbery of me too that I should never have known
      of the inheritance he had prepared for me. I thank you with my whole soul.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be worthy of him, young man. What is your vocation?&rdquo; This
      question was put with a quick abruptness which embarrassed Deronda, who
      did not feel it quite honest to allege his law-reading as a vocation. He
      answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say that I have any.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get one, get one. The Jew must be diligent. You will call yourself
      a Jew and profess the faith of your fathers?&rdquo; said Kalonymos,
      putting his hand on Deronda&rsquo;s shoulder and looking sharply in his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall call myself a Jew,&rdquo; said Deronda, deliberately,
      becoming slightly paler under the piercing eyes of his questioner. &ldquo;But
      I will not say that I shall profess to believe exactly as my fathers have
      believed. Our fathers themselves changed the horizon of their belief and
      learned of other races. But I think I can maintain my grandfather&rsquo;s
      notion of separateness with communication. I hold that my first duty is to
      my own people, and if there is anything to be done toward restoring or
      perfecting their common life, I shall make that my vocation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened to Deronda at that moment, as it has often happened to others,
      that the need for speech made an epoch in resolve. His respect for the
      questioner would not let him decline to answer, and by the necessity to
      answer he found out the truth for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you argue and you look forward&mdash;you are Daniel Charisi&rsquo;s
      grandson,&rdquo; said Kalonymos, adding a benediction in Hebrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that they parted; and almost as soon as Deronda was in London, the
      aged man was again on shipboard, greeting the friendly stars without any
      eager curiosity.

      CHAPTER LXI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Within the gentle heart Love shelters him,
    As birds within the green shade of the grove.
  Before the gentle heart, in Nature&rsquo;s scheme,
    Love was not, nor the gentle heart ere Love.&rdquo;
             &mdash;GUIDO GUINICELLI (<i>Rossetti&rsquo;s Translation</i>).
</pre>
    <p>
      There was another house besides the white house at Pennicote, another
      breast besides Rex Gascoigne&rsquo;s, in which the news of Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      death caused both strong agitation and the effort to repress it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Hans Meyrick&rsquo;s habit to send or bring in the <i>Times</i> for
      his mother&rsquo;s reading. She was a great reader of news, from the
      widest-reaching politics to the list of marriages; the latter, she said,
      giving her the pleasant sense of finishing the fashionable novels without
      having read them, and seeing the heroes and heroines happy without knowing
      what poor creatures they were. On a Wednesday, there were reasons why Hans
      always chose to bring the paper, and to do so about the time that Mirah
      had nearly ended giving Mab her weekly lesson, avowing that he came then
      because he wanted to hear Mirah sing. But on the particular Wednesday now
      in question, after entering the house as quietly as usual with his
      latch-key, he appeared in the parlor, shaking the <i>Times</i> aloft with
      a crackling noise, in remorseless interruption of Mab&rsquo;s attempt to
      render <i>Lascia ch&rsquo;io pianga</i> with a remote imitation of her
      teacher. Piano and song ceased immediately; Mirah, who had been playing
      the accompaniment, involuntarily started up and turned round, the
      crackling sound, after the occasional trick of sounds, having seemed to
      her something thunderous; and Mab said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O-o-o, Hans! why do you bring a more horrible noise than my
      singing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is the wonderful news?&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick, who
      was the only other person in the room. &ldquo;Anything about Italy&mdash;anything
      about the Austrians giving up Venice?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing about Italy, but something from Italy,&rdquo; said Hans,
      with a peculiarity in his tone and manner which set his mother
      interpreting. Imagine how some of us feel and behave when an event, not
      disagreeable seems to be confirming and carrying out our private
      constructions. We say, &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; in a pregnant tone
      to some innocent person who has not embarked his wisdom in the same boat
      with ours, and finds our information flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing bad?&rdquo; said Mrs. Meyrick anxiously, thinking
      immediately of Deronda; and Mirah&rsquo;s heart had been already clutched
      by the same thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not bad for anybody we care much about,&rdquo; said Hans, quickly;
      &ldquo;rather uncommonly lucky, I think. I never knew anybody die
      conveniently before. Considering what a dear gazelle I am, I am constantly
      wondering to find myself alive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh me, Hans!&rdquo; said Mab, impatiently, &ldquo;if you must talk
      of yourself, let it be behind your own back. What <i>is</i> it that has
      happened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duke Alfonso is drowned, and the Duchess is alive, that&rsquo;s
      all,&rdquo; said Hans, putting the paper before Mrs. Meyrick, with his
      finger against a paragraph. &ldquo;But more than all is&mdash;Deronda was
      at Genoa in the same hotel with them, and he saw her brought in by the
      fishermen who had got her out of the water time enough to save her from
      any harm. It seems they saw her jump in after her husband, which was a
      less judicious action than I should have expected of the Duchess. However
      Deronda is a lucky fellow in being there to take care of her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah had sunk on the music stool again, with her eyelids down and her
      hands tightly clasped; and Mrs. Meyrick, giving up the paper to Mab, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing! she must have been fond of her husband to jump in after
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an inadvertence&mdash;a little absence of mind,&rdquo; said
      Hans, creasing his face roguishly, and throwing himself into a chair not
      far from Mirah. &ldquo;Who can be fond of a jealous baritone, with
      freezing glances, always singing asides?&mdash;that was the husband&rsquo;s
      <i>rôle</i>, depend upon it. Nothing can be neater than his getting
      drowned. The Duchess is at liberty now to marry a man with a fine head of
      hair, and glances that will melt instead of freezing her. And I shall be
      invited to the wedding.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mirah started from her sitting posture, and fixing her eyes on Hans,
      with an angry gleam in them, she said, in a deeply-shaken voice of
      indignation,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hans, you ought not to speak in that way. Mr. Deronda would not
      like you to speak so. Why will you say he is lucky&mdash;why will you use
      words of that sort about life and death&mdash;when what is life to one is
      death to another? How do you know it would be lucky if he loved Mrs.
      Grandcourt? It might be a great evil to him. She would take him away from
      my brother&mdash;I know she would. Mr. Deronda would not call that lucky
      to pierce my brother&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All three were struck with the sudden transformation. Mirah&rsquo;s face,
      with a look of anger that might have suited Ithuriel, pale, even to the
      lips that were usually so rich of tint, was not far from poor Hans, who
      sat transfixed, blushing under it as if he had been a girl, while he said,
      nervously,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a fool and a brute, and I withdraw every word. I&rsquo;ll go
      and hang myself like Judas&mdash;if it&rsquo;s allowable to mention him.&rdquo;
      Even in Hans&rsquo;s sorrowful moments, his improvised words had
      inevitably some drollery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mirah&rsquo;s anger was not appeased: how could it be? She had burst
      into indignant speech as creatures in intense pain bite and make their
      teeth meet even through their own flesh, by way of making their agony
      bearable. She said no more, but, seating herself at the piano, pressed the
      sheet of music before her, as if she thought of beginning to play again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mab who spoke, while Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s face seemed to reflect
      some of Hans&rsquo; discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mirah is quite right to scold you, Hans. You are always taking Mr.
      Deronda&rsquo;s name in vain. And it is horrible, joking in that way about
      his marrying Mrs. Grandcourt. Men&rsquo;s minds must be very black, I
      think,&rdquo; ended Mab, with much scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true, my dear,&rdquo; said Hans, in a low tone, rising and
      turning on his heel to walk toward the back window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had better go on, Mab; you have not given your full time to the
      lesson,&rdquo; said Mirah, in a higher tone than usual. &ldquo;Will you
      sing this again, or shall I sing it to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please sing it to me,&rdquo; said Mab, rejoiced to take no more
      notice of what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mirah immediately sang <i>Lascia ch&rsquo;io pianga</i>, giving forth
      its melodious sobs and cries with new fullness and energy. Hans paused in
      his walk and leaned against the mantel-piece, keeping his eyes carefully
      away from his mother&rsquo;s. When Mirah had sung her last note and
      touched the last chord, she rose and said, &ldquo;I must go home now. Ezra
      expects me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave her hand silently to Mrs. Meyrick and hung back a little, not
      daring to look at her, instead of kissing her, as usual. But the little
      mother drew Mirah&rsquo;s face down to hers, and said, soothingly, &ldquo;God
      bless you, my dear.&rdquo; Mirah felt that she had committed an offense
      against Mrs. Meyrick by angrily rebuking Hans, and mixed with the rest of
      her suffering was the sense that she had shown something like a proud
      ingratitude, an unbecoming assertion of superiority. And her friend had
      divined this compunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Hans had seized his wide-awake, and was ready to open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Hans,&rdquo; said Mab, with what was really a sister&rsquo;s
      tenderness cunningly disguised, &ldquo;you are not going to walk home with
      Mirah. I am sure she would rather not. You are so dreadfully disagreeable
      to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go to take care of her, if she does not forbid me,&rdquo;
      said Hans, opening the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah said nothing, and when he had opened the outer door for her and
      closed it behind him, he walked by her side unforbidden. She had not the
      courage to begin speaking to him again&mdash;conscious that she had
      perhaps been unbecomingly severe in her words to him, yet finding only
      severer words behind them in her heart. Besides, she was pressed upon by a
      crowd of thoughts thrusting themselves forward as interpreters of that
      consciousness which still remained unaltered to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hans, on his side, had a mind equally busy. Mirah&rsquo;s anger had waked
      in him a new perception, and with it the unpleasant sense that he was a
      dolt not to have had it before. Suppose Mirah&rsquo;s heart were entirely
      preoccupied with Deronda in another character than that of her own and her
      brother&rsquo;s benefactor; the supposition was attended in Hans&rsquo;s
      mind with anxieties which, to do him justice, were not altogether selfish.
      He had a strong persuasion, which only direct evidence to the contrary
      could have dissipated, and that was that there was a serious attachment
      between Deronda and Mrs. Grandcourt; he had pieced together many fragments
      of observation, and gradually gathered knowledge, completed by what his
      sisters had heard from Anna Gascoigne, which convinced him not only that
      Mrs. Grandcourt had a passion for Deronda, but also, notwithstanding his
      friend&rsquo;s austere self-repression, that Deronda&rsquo;s
      susceptibility about her was the sign of concealed love. Some men, having
      such a conviction, would have avoided allusions that could have roused
      that susceptibility; but Hans&rsquo;s talk naturally fluttered toward
      mischief, and he was given to a form of experiment on live animals which
      consisted in irritating his friends playfully. His experiments had ended
      in satisfying him that what he thought likely was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, any susceptibility Deronda had manifested about a lover&rsquo;s
      attentions being shown to Mirah, Hans took to be sufficiently accounted
      for by the alleged reason, namely, her dependent position; for he credited
      his friend with all possible unselfish anxiety for those whom he could
      rescue and protect. And Deronda&rsquo;s insistence that Mirah would never
      marry one who was not a Jew necessarily seemed to exclude himself, since
      Hans shared the ordinary opinion, which he knew nothing to disturb, that
      Deronda was the son of Sir Hugo Mallinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he felt himself in clearness about the state of Deronda&rsquo;s
      affections; but now, the events which really struck him as concurring
      toward the desirable union with Mrs. Grandcourt, had called forth a flash
      of revelation from Mirah&mdash;a betrayal of her passionate feeling on
      this subject which had made him melancholy on her account as well as his
      own&mdash;yet on the whole less melancholy than if he had imagined Deronda&rsquo;s
      hopes fixed on her. It is not sublime, but it is common, for a man to see
      the beloved object unhappy because his rival loves another, with more
      fortitude and a milder jealousy than if he saw her entirely happy in his
      rival. At least it was so with the mercurial Hans, who fluctuated between
      the contradictory states of feeling, wounded because Mirah was wounded,
      and of being almost obliged to Deronda for loving somebody else. It was
      impossible for him to give Mirah any direct sign of the way in which he
      had understood her anger, yet he longed that his speechless companionship
      should be eloquent in a tender, penitent sympathy which is an admissible
      form of wooing a bruised heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the two went side by side in a companionship that yet seemed an
      agitated communication, like that of two chords whose quick vibrations lie
      outside our hearing. But when they reached the door of Mirah&rsquo;s home,
      and Hans said &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; putting out his hand with an
      appealing look of penitence, she met the look with melancholy gentleness,
      and said, &ldquo;Will you not come in and see my brother?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hans could not but interpret this invitation as a sign of pardon. He had
      not enough understanding of what Mirah&rsquo;s nature had been wrought
      into by her early experience, to divine how the very strength of her late
      excitement had made it pass more quickly into the resolute acceptance of
      pain. When he had said, &ldquo;If you will let me,&rdquo; and they went in
      together, half his grief was gone, and he was spinning a little romance of
      how his devotion might make him indispensable to Mirah in proportion as
      Deronda gave his devotion elsewhere. This was quite fair, since his friend
      was provided for according to his own heart; and on the question of
      Judaism Hans felt thoroughly fortified:&mdash;who ever heard in tale or
      history that a woman&rsquo;s love went in the track of her race and
      religion? Moslem and Jewish damsels were always attracted toward
      Christians, and now if Mirah&rsquo;s heart had gone forth too
      precipitately toward Deronda, here was another case in point. Hans was
      wont to make merry with his own arguments, to call himself a Giaour, and
      antithesis the sole clue to events; but he believed a little in what he
      laughed at. And thus his bird-like hope, constructed on the lightest
      principles, soared again in spite of heavy circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Mordecai looking singularly happy, holding a closed letter in
      his hand, his eyes glowing with a quiet triumph which in his emaciated
      face gave the idea of a conquest over assailing death. After the greeting
      between him and Hans, Mirah put her arm round her brother&rsquo;s neck and
      looked down at the letter in his hand, without the courage to ask about
      it, though she felt sure that it was the cause of his happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter from Daniel Deronda,&rdquo; said Mordecai, answering her
      look. &ldquo;Brief&mdash;only saying that he hopes soon to return.
      Unexpected claims have detained him. The promise of seeing him again is
      like the bow in the cloud to me,&rdquo; continued Mordecai, looking at
      Hans; &ldquo;and to you it must be a gladness. For who has two friends
      like him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While Hans was answering Mirah slipped away to her own room; but not to
      indulge in any outburst of the passion within her. If the angels, once
      supposed to watch the toilet of women, had entered the little chamber with
      her and let her shut the door behind them, they would only have seen her
      take off her hat, sit down and press her hands against her temples as if
      she had suddenly reflected that her head ached; then rise to dash cold
      water on her eyes and brow and hair till her backward curls were full of
      crystal beads, while she had dried her brow and looked out like a
      freshly-opened flower from among the dewy tresses of the woodland; then
      give deep sighs of relief, and putting on her little slippers, sit still
      after that action for a couple of minutes, which seemed to her so long, so
      full of things to come, that she rose with an air of recollection, and
      went down to make tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of the old life had returned. She had been used to remember that
      she must learn her part, must go to rehearsal, must act and sing in the
      evening, must hide her feelings from her father; and the more painful her
      life grew, the more she had been used to hide. The force of her nature had
      long found its chief action in resolute endurance, and to-day the violence
      of feeling which had caused the first jet of anger had quickly transformed
      itself into a steady facing of trouble, the well-known companion of her
      young years. But while she moved about and spoke as usual, a close
      observer might have discerned a difference between this apparent calm,
      which was the effect of restraining energy, and the sweet genuine calm of
      the months when she first felt a return of her infantine happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who have been indulged by fortune and have always thought of
      calamity as what happens to others, feel a blind incredulous rage at the
      reversal of their lot, and half believe that their wild cries will alter
      the course of the storm. Mirah felt no such surprise when familiar Sorrow
      came back from brief absence, and sat down with her according to the old
      use and wont. And this habit of expecting trouble rather than joy,
      hindered her from having any persistent belief in opposition to the
      probabilities which were not merely suggested by Hans, but were supported
      by her own private knowledge and long-growing presentiment. An attachment
      between Deronda and Mrs. Grandcourt, to end in their future marriage, had
      the aspect of a certainty for her feeling. There had been no fault in him:
      facts had ordered themselves so that there was a tie between him and this
      woman who belonged to another world than hers and Ezra&rsquo;s&mdash;nay,
      who seemed another sort of being than Deronda, something foreign that
      would be a disturbance in his life instead of blending with it. Well, well&mdash;but
      if it could have been deferred so as to make no difference while Ezra was
      there! She did not know all the momentousness of the relation between
      Deronda and her brother, but she had seen, and instinctively felt enough
      to forebode its being incongruous with any close tie to Mrs. Grandcourt;
      at least this was the clothing that Mirah first gave to her mortal
      repugnance. But in the still, quick action of her consciousness, thoughts
      went on like changing states of sensation unbroken by her habitual acts;
      and this inward language soon said distinctly that the mortal repugnance
      would remain even if Ezra were secured from loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have read about and sung about and seen acted, is happening
      to me&mdash;this that I am feeling is the love that makes jealousy;&rdquo;
      so impartially Mirah summed up the charge against herself. But what
      difference could this pain of hers make to any one else? It must remain as
      exclusively her own, and hidden, as her early yearning and devotion to her
      lost mother. But unlike that devotion, it was something that she felt to
      be a misfortune of her nature&mdash;a discovery that what should have been
      pure gratitude and reverence had sunk into selfish pain, that the feeling
      she had hitherto delighted to pour out in words was degraded into
      something she was ashamed to betray&mdash;an absurd longing that she who
      had received all and given nothing should be of importance where she was
      of no importance&mdash;an angry feeling toward another woman who possessed
      the good she wanted. But what notion, what vain reliance could it be that
      had lain darkly within her and was now burning itself into sight as
      disappointment and jealousy? It was as if her soul had been steeped in
      poisonous passion by forgotten dreams of deep sleep, and now flamed out in
      this unaccountable misery. For with her waking reason she had never
      entertained what seemed the wildly unfitting thought that Deronda could
      love her. The uneasiness she had felt before had been comparatively vague
      and easily explained as part of a general regret that he was only a
      visitant in her and her brother&rsquo;s world, from which the world where
      his home lay was as different as a portico with lights and lacqueys was
      different from the door of a tent, where the only splendor came from the
      mysterious inaccessible stars. But her feeling was no longer vague: the
      cause of her pain&mdash;the image of Mrs. Grandcourt by Deronda&rsquo;s
      side, drawing him farther and farther into the distance, was as definite
      as pincers on her flesh. In the Psyche-mould of Mirah&rsquo;s frame there
      rested a fervid quality of emotion, sometimes rashly supposed to require
      the bulk of a Cleopatra; her impressions had the thoroughness and tenacity
      that give to the first selection of passionate feeling the character of a
      lifelong faithfulness. And now a selection had declared itself, which gave
      love a cruel heart of jealousy: she had been used to a strong repugnance
      toward certain objects that surrounded her, and to walk inwardly aloof
      from them while they touched her sense. And now her repugnance
      concentrated itself on Mrs. Grandcourt, of whom she involuntarily
      conceived more evil than she knew. &ldquo;I could bear everything that
      used to be&mdash;but this is worse&mdash;this is worse,&mdash;I used not
      to have horrible feelings!&rdquo; said the poor child in a loud whisper to
      her pillow. Strange that she should have to pray against any feeling which
      concerned Deronda!
    </p>
    <p>
      But this conclusion had been reached through an evening spent in attending
      to Mordecai, whose exaltation of spirit in the prospect of seeing his
      friend again, disposed him to utter many thoughts aloud to Mirah, though
      such communication was often interrupted by intervals apparently filled
      with an inward utterance that animated his eyes and gave an occasional
      silent action to his lips. One thought especially occupied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seest thou, Mirah,&rdquo; he said once, after a long silence,
      &ldquo;the <i>Shemah</i>, wherein we briefly confess the divine Unity, is
      the chief devotional exercise of the Hebrew; and this made our religion
      the fundamental religion for the whole world; for the divine Unity
      embraced as its consequence the ultimate unity of mankind. See, then&mdash;the
      nation which has been scoffed at for its separateness, has given a binding
      theory to the human race. Now, in complete unity a part possesses the
      whole as the whole possesses every part: and in this way human life is
      tending toward the image of the Supreme Unity: for as our life becomes
      more spiritual by capacity of thought, and joy therein, possession tends
      to become more universal, being independent of gross material contact; so
      that in a brief day the soul of man may know in fuller volume the good
      which has been and is, nay, is to come, than all he could possess in a
      whole life where he had to follow the creeping paths of the senses. In
      this moment, my sister, I hold the joy of another&rsquo;s future within
      me: a future which these eyes will not see, and which my spirit may not
      then recognize as mine. I recognize it now, and love it so, that I can lay
      down this poor life upon its altar and say: &lsquo;Burn, burn
      indiscernibly into that which shall be, which is my love and not me.&rsquo;
      Dost thou understand, Mirah?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little,&rdquo; said Mirah, faintly, &ldquo;but my mind is too
      poor to have felt it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Mordecai, rather insistently, &ldquo;women are
      specially framed for the love which feels possession in renouncing, and is
      thus a fit image of what I mean. Somewhere in the later <i>Midrash</i>, I
      think, is the story of a Jewish maiden who loved a Gentile king so well,
      that this was what she did:&mdash;she entered into prison and changed
      clothes with the woman who was beloved by the king, that she might deliver
      that woman from death by dying in her stead, and leave the king to be
      happy in his love which was not for her. This is the surpassing love, that
      loses self in the object of love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Ezra, no,&rdquo; said Mirah, with low-toned intensity, &ldquo;that
      was not it. She wanted the king when she was dead to know what she had
      done, and feel that she was better than the other. It was her strong self,
      wanting to conquer, that made her die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai was silent a little, and then argued,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might be, Mirah. But if she acted so, believing the king would
      never know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can make the story so in your mind, Ezra, because you are
      great, and like to fancy the greatest that could be. But I think it was
      not really like that. The Jewish girl must have had jealousy in her heart,
      and she wanted somehow to have the first place in the king&rsquo;s mind.
      That is what she would die for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister, thou hast read too many plays, where the writers delight
      in showing the human passions as indwelling demons, unmixed with the
      relenting and devout elements of the soul. Thou judgest by the plays, and
      not by thy own heart, which is like our mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah made no answer.

  &ldquo;Das Gluck ist eine leichte Dirne,

  Und kusst dich rasch und flattert fort

  Frau Ungluck hat im Gegentheile

                                      &mdash;HEINE.
</pre>
    <p>
      Something which Mirah had lately been watching for as the fulfilment of a
      threat, seemed now the continued visit of that familiar sorrow which had
      lately come back, bringing abundant luggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning out of Knightsbridge, after singing at a charitable morning
      concert in a wealthy house, where she had been recommended by Klesmer, and
      where there had been the usual groups outside to see the departing
      company, she began to feel herself dogged by footsteps that kept an even
      pace with her own. Her concert dress being simple black, over which she
      had thrown a dust cloak, could not make her an object of unpleasant
      attention, and render walking an imprudence; but this reflection did not
      occur to Mirah: another kind of alarm lay uppermost in her mind. She
      immediately thought of her father, and could no more look round than if
      she had felt herself tracked by a ghost. To turn and face him would be
      voluntarily to meet the rush of emotions which beforehand seemed
      intolerable. If it were her father he must mean to claim recognition, and
      he would oblige her to face him. She must wait for that compulsion. She
      walked on, not quickening her pace&mdash;of what use was that?&mdash;but
      picturing what was about to happen as if she had the full certainty that
      the man behind her was her father; and along with her picturing went a
      regret that she had given her word to Mrs. Meyrick not to use any
      concealment about him. The regret at last urged her, at least, to try and
      hinder any sudden betrayal that would cause her brother an unnecessary
      shock. Under the pressure of this motive, she resolved to turn before she
      reached her own door, and firmly will the encounter instead of merely
      submitting to it. She had already reached the entrance of the small square
      where her home lay, and had made up her mind to turn, when she felt her
      embodied presentiment getting closer to her, then slipping to her side,
      grasping her wrist, and saying, with a persuasive curl of accent, &ldquo;Mirah!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused at once without any start; it was the voice she expected, and
      she was meeting the expected eyes. Her face was as grave as if she had
      been looking at her executioner, while his was adjusted to the intention
      of soothing and propitiating her. Once a handsome face, with bright color,
      it was now sallow and deep-lined, and had that peculiar impress of
      impudent suavity which comes from courting favor while accepting
      disrespect. He was lightly made and active, with something of youth about
      him which made the signs of age seem a disguise; and in reality he was
      hardly fifty-seven. His dress was shabby, as when she had seen him before.
      The presence of this unreverend father now, more than ever, affected Mirah
      with the mingled anguish of shame and grief, repulsion and pity&mdash;more
      than ever, now that her own world was changed into one where there was no
      comradeship to fence him from scorn and contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, with a sad, tremulous voice, she said, &ldquo;It is you, father.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you run away from me, child?&rdquo; he began with rapid
      speech which was meant to have a tone of tender remonstrance, accompanied
      with various quick gestures like an abbreviated finger-language. &ldquo;What
      were you afraid of? You knew I never made you do anything against your
      will. It was for your sake I broke up your engagement in the Vorstadt,
      because I saw it didn&rsquo;t suit you, and you repaid me by leaving me to
      the bad times that came in consequence. I had made an easier engagement
      for you at the Vorstadt Theater in Dresden: I didn&rsquo;t tell you,
      because I wanted to take you by surprise. And you left me planted there&mdash;obliged
      to make myself scarce because I had broken contract. That was hard lines
      for me, after I had given up everything for the sake of getting you an
      education which was to be a fortune to you. What father devoted himself to
      his daughter more than I did to you? You know how I bore that
      disappointment in your voice, and made the best of it: and when I had
      nobody besides you, and was getting broken, as a man must who has had to
      fight his way with his brains&mdash;you chose that time to leave me. Who
      else was it you owed everything to, if not to me? and where was your
      feeling in return? For what my daughter cared, I might have died in a
      ditch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lapidoth stopped short here, not from lack of invention, but because he
      had reached a pathetic climax, and gave a sudden sob, like a woman&rsquo;s,
      taking out hastily an old yellow silk handkerchief. He really felt that
      his daughter had treated him ill&mdash;a sort of sensibility which is
      naturally strong in unscrupulous persons, who put down what is owing to
      them, without any <i>per contra</i>. Mirah, in spite of that sob, had
      energy enough not to let him suppose that he deceived her. She answered
      more firmly, though it was the first time she had ever used accusing words
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know why I left you, father; and I had reason to distrust you,
      because I felt sure that you had deceived my mother. If I could have
      trusted you, I would have stayed with you and worked for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never meant to deceive your mother, Mirah,&rdquo; said Lapidoth,
      putting back his handkerchief, but beginning with a voice that seemed to
      struggle against further sobbing. &ldquo;I meant to take you back to her,
      but chances hindered me just at the time, and then there came information
      of her death. It was better for you that I should stay where I was, and
      your brother could take care of himself. Nobody had any claim on me but
      you. I had word of your mother&rsquo;s death from a particular friend, who
      had undertaken to manage things for me, and I sent him over money to pay
      expenses. There&rsquo;s one chance to be sure&mdash;&rdquo; Lapidoth had
      quickly conceived that he must guard against something unlikely, yet
      possible&mdash;&ldquo;he may have written me lies for the sake of getting
      the money out of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah made no answer; she could not bear to utter the only true one&mdash;&ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t believe one word of what you say&rdquo;&mdash;and she simply
      showed a wish that they should walk on, feeling that their standing still
      might draw down unpleasant notice. Even as they walked along, their
      companionship might well have made a passer-by turn back to look at them.
      The figure of Mirah, with her beauty set off by the quiet, careful dress
      of an English lady, made a strange pendant to this shabby,
      foreign-looking, eager, and gesticulating man, who withal had an
      ineffaceable jauntiness of air, perhaps due to the bushy curls of his
      grizzled hair, the smallness of his hands and feet, and his light walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have done well for yourself, Mirah? <i>You</i> are in
      no want, I see,&rdquo; said the father, looking at her with emphatic
      examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good friends who found me in distress have helped me to get work,&rdquo;
      said Mirah, hardly knowing what she actually said, from being occupied
      with what she would presently have to say. &ldquo;I give lessons. I have
      sung in private houses. I have just been singing at a private concert.&rdquo;
      She paused, and then added, with significance, &ldquo;I have very good
      friends, who know all about me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would be ashamed they should see your father in this
      plight? No wonder. I came to England with no prospect, but the chance of
      finding you. It was a mad quest; but a father&rsquo;s heart is
      superstitious&mdash;feels a loadstone drawing it somewhere or other. I
      might have done very well, staying abroad: when I hadn&rsquo;t you to take
      care of, I could have rolled or settled as easily as a ball; but it&rsquo;s
      hard being lonely in the world, when your spirit&rsquo;s beginning to
      break. And I thought my little Mirah would repent leaving her father when
      she came to look back. I&rsquo;ve had a sharp pinch to work my way; I don&rsquo;t
      know what I shall come down to next. Talents like mine are no use in this
      country. When a man&rsquo;s getting out at elbows nobody will believe in
      him. I couldn&rsquo;t get any decent employ with my appearance. I&rsquo;ve
      been obliged to get pretty low for a shilling already.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah&rsquo;s anxiety was quick enough to imagine her father&rsquo;s
      sinking into a further degradation, which she was bound to hinder if she
      could. But before she could answer his string of inventive sentences,
      delivered with as much glibness as if they had been learned by rote, he
      added promptly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you live, Mirah?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, in this square. We are not far from the house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In lodgings?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one to take care of you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mirah again, looking full at the keen face which
      was turned toward hers&mdash;&ldquo;my brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The father&rsquo;s eyelids fluttered as if the lightning had come across
      them, and there was a slight movement of the shoulders. But he said, after
      a just perceptible pause: &ldquo;Ezra? How did you know&mdash;how did you
      find him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would take long to tell. Here we are at the door. My brother
      would not wish me to close it on you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah was already on the doorstep, but had her face turned toward her
      father, who stood below her on the pavement. Her heart had begun to beat
      faster with the prospect of what was coming in the presence of Ezra; and
      already in this attitude of giving leave to the father whom she had been
      used to obey&mdash;in this sight of him standing below her, with a
      perceptible shrinking from the admission which he had been indirectly
      asking for, she had a pang of the peculiar, sympathetic humiliation and
      shame&mdash;the stabbed heart of reverence&mdash;which belongs to a nature
      intensely filial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay a minute, <i>Liebchen</i>,&rdquo; said Lapidoth, speaking in a
      lowered tone; &ldquo;what sort of man has Ezra turned out?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good man&mdash;a wonderful man,&rdquo; said Mirah, with slow
      emphasis, trying to master the agitation which made her voice more
      tremulous as she went on. She felt urged to prepare her father for the
      complete penetration of himself which awaited him. &ldquo;But he was very
      poor when my friends found him for me&mdash;a poor workman. Once&mdash;twelve
      years ago&mdash;he was strong and happy, going to the East, which he loved
      to think of; and my mother called him back because&mdash;because she had
      lost me. And he went to her, and took care of her through great trouble,
      and worked for her till she died&mdash;died in grief. And Ezra, too, had
      lost his health and strength. The cold had seized him coming back to my
      mother, because she was forsaken. For years he has been getting weaker&mdash;always
      poor, always working&mdash;but full of knowledge, and great-minded. All
      who come near him honor him. To stand before him is like standing before a
      prophet of God&rdquo;&mdash;Mirah ended with difficulty, her heart
      throbbing&mdash;&ldquo;falsehoods are no use.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had cast down her eyes that she might not see her father while she
      spoke the last words&mdash;unable to bear the ignoble look of frustration
      that gathered in his face. But he was none the less quick in invention and
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mirah, <i>Liebchen</i>,&rdquo; he said, in the old caressing way,
      &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t you like me to make myself a little more
      respectable before my son sees me? If I had a little sum of money, I could
      fit myself out and come home to you as your father ought, and then I could
      offer myself for some decent place. With a good shirt and coat on my back,
      people would be glad enough to have me. I could offer myself for a
      courier, if I didn&rsquo;t look like a broken-down mountebank. I should
      like to be with my children, and forget and forgive. But you have never
      seen your father look like this before. If you had ten pounds at hand&mdash;or
      I could appoint you to bring it me somewhere&mdash;I could fit myself out
      by the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah felt herself under a temptation which she must try to overcome. She
      answered, obliging herself to look at him again,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to deny you what you ask, father; but I have
      given a promise not to do things for you in secret. It <i>is</i> hard to
      see you looking needy; but we will bear that for a little while; and then
      you can have new clothes, and we can pay for them.&rdquo; Her practical
      sense made her see now what was Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s wisdom in exacting a
      promise from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lapidoth&rsquo;s good humor gave way a little. He said, with a sneer,
      &ldquo;You are a hard and fast young lady&mdash;you have been learning
      useful virtues&mdash;keeping promises not to help your father with a pound
      or two when you are getting money to dress yourself in silk&mdash;your
      father who made an idol of you, and gave up the best part of his life to
      providing for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems cruel&mdash;I know it seems cruel,&rdquo; said Mirah,
      feeling this a worse moment than when she meant to drown herself. Her lips
      were suddenly pale. &ldquo;But, father, it is more cruel to break the
      promises people trust in. That broke my mother&rsquo;s heart&mdash;it has
      broken Ezra&rsquo;s life. You and I must eat now this bitterness from what
      has been. Bear it. Bear to come in and be cared for as you are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, then,&rdquo; said Lapidoth, almost turning on his heel
      away from this pale, trembling daughter, who seemed now to have got the
      inconvenient world to back her; but he quickly turned on it again, with
      his hands feeling about restlessly in his pockets, and said, with some
      return to his appealing tone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little cut up with all
      this, Mirah. I shall get up my spirits by to-morrow. If you&rsquo;ve a
      little money in your pocket, I suppose it isn&rsquo;t against your promise
      to give me a trifle&mdash;to buy a cigar with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah could not ask herself another question&mdash;could not do anything
      else than put her cold trembling hands in her pocket for her <i>portemonnaie</i>
      and hold it out. Lapidoth grasped it at once, pressed her fingers the
      while, said, &ldquo;Good-bye, my little girl&mdash;to-morrow then!&rdquo;
      and left her. He had not taken many steps before he looked carefully into
      all the folds of the purse, found two half-sovereigns and odd silver, and,
      pasted against the folding cover, a bit of paper on which Ezra had
      inscribed, in a beautiful Hebrew character, the name of his mother, the
      days of her birth, marriage, and death, and the prayer, &ldquo;May Mirah
      be delivered from evil.&rdquo; It was Mirah&rsquo;s liking to have this
      little inscription on many articles that she used. The father read it, and
      had a quick vision of his marriage day, and the bright, unblamed young
      fellow he was at that time; teaching many things, but expecting by-and-by
      to get money more easily by writing; and very fond of his beautiful bride
      Sara&mdash;crying when she expected him to cry, and reflecting every phase
      of her feeling with mimetic susceptibility. Lapidoth had traveled a long
      way from that young self, and thought of all that this inscription
      signified with an unemotional memory, which was like the ocular perception
      of a touch to one who has lost the sense of touch, or like morsels on an
      untasting palate, having shape and grain, but no flavor. Among the things
      we may gamble away in a lazy selfish life is the capacity for ruth,
      compunction, or any unselfish regret&mdash;which we may come to long for
      as one in slow death longs to feel laceration, rather than be conscious of
      a widening margin where consciousness once was. Mirah&rsquo;s purse was a
      handsome one&mdash;a gift to her, which she had been unable to reflect
      about giving away&mdash;and Lapidoth presently found himself outside of
      his reverie, considering what the purse would fetch in addition to the sum
      it contained, and what prospect there was of his being able to get more
      from his daughter without submitting to adopt a penitential form of life
      under the eyes of that formidable son. On such a subject his
      susceptibilities were still lively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mirah had entered the house with her power of reticence overcome
      by the cruelty of her pain. She found her brother quietly reading and
      sifting old manuscripts of his own, which he meant to consign to Deronda.
      In the reaction from the long effort to master herself, she fell down
      before him and clasped his knees, sobbing, and crying, &ldquo;Ezra, Ezra!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak. His alarm for her spending itself on conceiving the
      cause of her distress, the more striking from the novelty in her of this
      violent manifestation. But Mirah&rsquo;s own longing was to be able to
      speak and tell him the cause. Presently she raised her hand, and still
      sobbing, said brokenly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ezra, my father! our father! He followed me. I wanted him to come
      in. I said you would let him come in. And he said No, he would not&mdash;not
      now, but to-morrow. And he begged for money from me. And I gave him my
      purse, and he went away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah&rsquo;s words seemed to herself to express all the misery she felt
      in them. Her brother found them less grievous than his preconceptions, and
      said gently, &ldquo;Wait for calm, Mirah, and then tell me all,&rdquo;&mdash;putting
      off her hat and laying his hands tenderly on her head. She felt the
      soothing influence, and in a few minutes told him as exactly as she could
      all that had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not come to-morrow,&rdquo; said Mordecai. Neither of them
      said to the other what they both thought, namely, that he might watch for
      Mirah&rsquo;s outgoings and beg from her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seest thou,&rdquo; he presently added, &ldquo;our lot is the lot of
      Israel. The grief and the glory are mingled as the smoke and the flame. It
      is because we children have inherited the good that we feel the evil.
      These things are wedded for us, as our father was wedded to our mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The surroundings were of Brompton, but the voice might have come from a
      Rabbi transmitting the sentences of an elder time to be registered in <i>Babli</i>&mdash;by
      which (to our ears) affectionate-sounding diminutive is meant the
      voluminous Babylonian Talmud. &ldquo;The Omnipresent,&rdquo; said a Rabbi,
      &ldquo;is occupied in making marriages.&rdquo; The levity of the saying
      lies in the ear of him who hears it; for by marriages the speaker meant
      all the wondrous combinations of the universe whose issue makes our good
      and evil.

      CHAPTER LXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moses, trotz seiner Befeindung der Kunst, dennoch selber ein großer
      Künstler war und den wahren Künstlergeist besaß. Nur war dieser
      Künstlergeist bei ihm, wie bei seinen ägyptischen Landsleuten, nur auf das
      Kolossale und Unverwüstliche gerichtet. Aber nicht wie die Ägypter
      formierte er seine Kunstwerke aus Backstein und Gra- nit, sondern er baute
      Menschenpyramiden, er meisselte Menschenobelisken, er nahm einen armen
      Hirten- stamm und schuf daraus ein Volk, das ebenfalls den Jahrhunderten
      trotzen sollte . . .er schuf Israel!&rdquo; &mdash;HEINE: <i>Gestandnisse</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine the difference in Deronda&rsquo;s state of mind when he left
      England and when he returned to it. He had set out for Genoa in total
      uncertainty how far the actual bent of his wishes and affections would be
      encouraged&mdash;how far the claims revealed to him might draw him into
      new paths, far away from the tracks his thoughts had lately been pursuing
      with a consent of desire which uncertainty made dangerous. He came back
      with something like a discovered charter warranting the inherited right
      that his ambition had begun to yearn for: he came back with what was
      better than freedom&mdash;with a duteous bond which his experience had
      been preparing him to accept gladly, even if it had been attended with no
      promise of satisfying a secret passionate longing never yet allowed to
      grow into a hope. But now he dared avow to himself the hidden selection of
      his love. Since the hour when he left the house at Chelsea in full-hearted
      silence under the effect of Mirah&rsquo;s farewell look and words&mdash;their
      exquisite appealingness stirring in him that deep-laid care for womanhood
      which had begun when his own lip was like a girl&rsquo;s&mdash;her hold on
      his feeling had helped him to be blameless in word and deed under the
      difficult circumstances we know of. There seemed no likelihood that he
      could ever woo this creature who had become dear to him amidst
      associations that forbade wooing; yet she had taken her place in his soul
      as a beloved type&mdash;reducing the power of other fascination and making
      a difference in it that became deficiency. The influence had been
      continually strengthened. It had lain in the course of poor Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      lot that her dependence on Deronda tended to rouse in him the enthusiasm
      of self-martyring pity rather than of personal love, and his less
      constrained tenderness flowed with the fuller stream toward an indwelling
      image in all things unlike Gwendolen. Still more, his relation to Mordecai
      had brought with it a new nearness to Mirah which was not the less
      agitating because there was no apparent change in his position toward her;
      and she had inevitably been bound up in all the thoughts that made him
      shrink from an issue disappointing to her brother. This process had not
      gone on unconsciously in Deronda: he was conscious of it as we are of some
      covetousness that it would be better to nullify by encouraging other
      thoughts than to give it the insistency of confession even to ourselves:
      but the jealous fire had leaped out at Hans&rsquo;s pretensions, and when
      his mother accused him of being in love with a Jewess any evasion suddenly
      seemed an infidelity. His mother had compelled him to a decisive
      acknowledgment of his love, as Joseph Kalonymos had compelled him to a
      definite expression of his resolve. This new state of decision wrought on
      Deronda with a force which surprised even himself. There was a release of
      all the energy which had long been spent in self-checking and suppression
      because of doubtful conditions; and he was ready to laugh at his own
      impetuosity when, as he neared England on his way from Mainz, he felt the
      remaining distance more and more of an obstruction. It was as if he had
      found an added soul in finding his ancestry&mdash;his judgment no longer
      wandering in the mazes of impartial sympathy, but choosing, with that
      partiality which is man&rsquo;s best strength, the closer fellowship that
      makes sympathy practical&mdash;exchanging that bird&rsquo;s eye
      reasonableness which soars to avoid preference and loses all sense of
      quality for the generous reasonableness of drawing shoulder to shoulder
      with men of like inheritance. He wanted now to be again with Mordecai, to
      pour forth instead of restraining his feeling, to admit agreement and
      maintain dissent, and all the while to find Mirah&rsquo;s presence without
      the embarrassment of obviously seeking it, to see her in the light of a
      new possibility, to interpret her looks and words from a new
      starting-point. He was not greatly alarmed about the effect of Hans&rsquo;s
      attentions, but he had a presentiment that her feeling toward himself had
      from the first lain in a channel from which it was not likely to be
      diverted into love. To astonish a woman by turning into her lover when she
      has been thinking of you merely as a Lord Chancellor is what a man
      naturally shrinks from: he is anxious to create an easier transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      What wonder that Deronda saw no other course than to go straight from the
      London railway station to the lodgings in that small square in Brompton?
      Every argument was in favor of his losing no time. He had promised to run
      down the next day to see Lady Mallinger at the Abbey, and it was already
      sunset. He wished to deposit the precious chest with Mordecai, who would
      study its contents, both in his absence and in company with him; and that
      he should pay this visit without pause would gratify Mordecai&rsquo;s
      heart. Hence, and for other reasons, it gratified Deronda&rsquo;s heart.
      The strongest tendencies of his nature were rushing in one current&mdash;the
      fervent affectionateness which made him delight in meeting the wish of
      beings near to him, and the imaginative need of some far-reaching relation
      to make the horizon of his immediate, daily acts. It has to be admitted
      that in this classical, romantic, world-historic position of his, bringing
      as it were from its hiding-place his hereditary armor, he wore&mdash;but
      so, one must suppose, did the most ancient heroes, whether Semitic or
      Japhetic&mdash;the summer costume of his contemporaries. He did not
      reflect that the drab tints were becoming to him, for he rarely went to
      the expense of such thinking; but his own depth of coloring, which made
      the becomingness, got an added radiance in the eyes, a fleeting and
      returning glow in the skin, as he entered the house wondering what exactly
      he should find. He made his entrance as noiseless as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the evening of that same afternoon on which Mirah had had the
      interview with her father. Mordecai, penetrated by her grief, and also the
      sad memories which the incident had awakened, had not resumed his task of
      sifting papers: some of them had fallen scattered on the floor in the
      first moments of anxiety, and neither he nor Mirah had thought of laying
      them in order again. They had sat perfectly still together, not knowing
      how long; while the clock ticked on the mantelpiece, and the light was
      fading, Mirah, unable to think of the food that she ought to have been
      taking, had not moved since she had thrown off her dust-cloak and sat down
      beside Mordecai with her hand in his, while he had laid his head backward,
      with closed eyes and difficult breathing, looking, Mirah thought, as he
      would look when the soul within him could no longer live in its straitened
      home. The thought that his death might be near was continually visiting
      her when she saw his face in this way, without its vivid animation; and
      now, to the rest of her grief, was added the regret that she had been
      unable to control the violent outburst which had shaken him. She sat
      watching him&mdash;her oval cheeks pallid, her eyes with the sorrowful
      brilliancy left by young tears, her curls in as much disorder as a
      just-awakened child&rsquo;s&mdash;watching that emaciated face, where it
      might have been imagined that a veil had been drawn never to be lifted, as
      if it were her dead joy which had left her strong enough to live on in
      sorrow. And life at that moment stretched before Mirah with more than a
      repetition of former sadness. The shadow of the father was there, and more
      than that, a double bereavement&mdash;of one living as well as one dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the door was opened, and while none entered, a well-known voice
      said: &ldquo;Daniel Deronda&mdash;may he come in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! come!&rdquo; said Mordecai, immediately rising with an
      irradiated face and opened eyes&mdash;apparently as little surprised as if
      he had seen Deronda in the morning, and expected this evening visit; while
      Mirah started up blushing with confused, half-alarmed expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet when Deronda entered, the sight of him was like the clearness after
      rain: no clouds to come could hinder the cherishing beam of that moment.
      As he held out his right hand to Mirah, who was close to her brother&rsquo;s
      left, he laid his other hand on Mordecai&rsquo;s right shoulder, and stood
      so a moment, holding them both at once, uttering no word, but reading
      their faces, till he said anxiously to Mirah, &ldquo;Has anything
      happened?&mdash;any trouble?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk not of trouble now,&rdquo; said Mordecai, saving her from the
      need to answer. &ldquo;There is joy in your face&mdash;let the joy be
      ours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah thought, &ldquo;It is for something he cannot tell us.&rdquo; But
      they all sat down, Deronda drawing a chair close in front of Mordecai.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; he said, emphatically. &ldquo;I have a joy
      which will remain to us even in the worst trouble. I did not tell you the
      reason of my journey abroad, Mordecai, because&mdash;never mind&mdash;I
      went to learn my parentage. And you were right. I am a Jew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men clasped hands with a movement that seemed part of the flash
      from Mordecai&rsquo;s eyes, and passed through Mirah like an electric
      shock. But Deronda went on without pause, speaking from Mordecai&rsquo;s
      mind as much as from his own,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have the same people. Our souls have the same vocation. We shall
      not be separated by life or by death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai&rsquo;s answer was uttered in Hebrew, and in no more than a loud
      whisper. It was in the liturgical words which express the religious bond:
      &ldquo;Our God and the God of our fathers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The weight of feeling pressed too strongly on that ready-winged speech
      which usually moved in quick adaptation to every stirring of his fervor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah fell on her knees by her brother&rsquo;s side, and looked at his now
      illuminated face, which had just before been so deathly. The action was an
      inevitable outlet of the violent reversal from despondency to a gladness
      which came over her as solemnly as if she had been beholding a religious
      rite. For the moment she thought of the effect on her own life only
      through the effect on her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is not only that I am a Jew,&rdquo; Deronda went on,
      enjoying one of those rare moments when our yearnings and our acts can be
      completely one, and the real we behold is our ideal good; &ldquo;but I
      come of a strain that has ardently maintained the fellowship of our race&mdash;a
      line of Spanish Jews that has borne many students and men of practical
      power. And I possess what will give us a sort of communion with them. My
      grandfather, Daniel Charisi, preserved manuscripts, family records
      stretching far back, in the hope that they would pass into the hands of
      his grandson. And now his hope is fulfilled, in spite of attempts to
      thwart it by hiding my parentage from me. I possess the chest containing
      them, with his own papers, and it is down below in this house. I mean to
      leave it with you, Mordecai, that you may help me to study the
      manuscripts. Some of them I can read easily enough&mdash;those in Spanish
      and Italian. Others are in Hebrew, and, I think, Arabic; but there seem to
      be Latin translations. I was only able to look at them cursorily while I
      stayed at Mainz. We will study them together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda ended with that bright smile which, beaming out from the habitual
      gravity of his face, seemed a revelation (the reverse of the continual
      smile that discredits all expression). But when this happy glance passed
      from Mordecai to rest on Mirah, it acted like a little too much sunshine,
      and made her change her attitude. She had knelt under an impulse with
      which any personal embarrassment was incongruous, and especially any
      thoughts about how Mrs. Grandcourt might stand to this new aspect of
      things&mdash;thoughts which made her color under Deronda&rsquo;s glance,
      and rise to take her seat again in her usual posture of crossed hands and
      feet, with the effort to look as quiet as possible. Deronda, equally
      sensitive, imagined that the feeling of which he was conscious, had
      entered too much into his eyes, and had been repugnant to her. He was
      ready enough to believe that any unexpected manifestation might spoil her
      feeling toward him&mdash;and then his precious relation to brother and
      sister would be marred. If Mirah could have no love for him, any advances
      of love on his part would make her wretched in that continual contact with
      him which would remain inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      While such feelings were pulsating quickly in Deronda and Mirah, Mordecai,
      seeing nothing in his friend&rsquo;s presence and words but a blessed
      fulfillment, was already speaking with his old sense of enlargement in
      utterance,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daniel, from the first, I have said to you, we know not all the
      pathways. Has there not been a meeting among them, as of the operations in
      one soul, where an idea being born and breathing draws the elements toward
      it, and is fed and glows? For all things are bound together in that
      Omnipresence which is the place and habitation of the world, and events
      are of a glass wherethrough our eyes see some of the pathways. And if it
      seems that the erring and unloving wills of men have helped to prepare
      you, as Moses was prepared, to serve your people the better, that depends
      on another order than the law which must guide our footsteps. For the evil
      will of man makes not a people&rsquo;s good except by stirring the
      righteous will of man; and beneath all the clouds with which our thought
      encompasses the Eternal, this is clear&mdash;that a people can be blessed
      only by having counsellors and a multitude whose will moves in obedience
      to the laws of justice and love. For see, now, it was your loving will
      that made a chief pathway, and resisted the effect of evil; for, by
      performing the duties of brotherhood to my sister, and seeking out her
      brother in the flesh, your soul has been prepared to receive with gladness
      this message of the Eternal, &lsquo;behold the multitude of your brethren.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite true that you and Mirah have been my teachers,&rdquo;
      said Deronda. &ldquo;If this revelation had been made to me before I knew
      you both, I think my mind would have rebelled against it. Perhaps I should
      have felt then&mdash;&lsquo;If I could have chosen, I would not have been
      a Jew.&rsquo; What I feel now is&mdash;that my whole being is a consent to
      the fact. But it has been the gradual accord between your mind and mine
      which has brought about that full consent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment Deronda was speaking, that first evening in the book-shop
      was vividly in his remembrance, with all the struggling aloofness he had
      then felt from Mordecai&rsquo;s prophetic confidence. It was his nature to
      delight in satisfying to the utmost the eagerly-expectant soul, which
      seemed to be looking out from the face before him, like the long-enduring
      watcher who at last sees the mountain signal-flame; and he went on with
      fuller fervor,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is through your inspiration that I have discerned what may be my
      life&rsquo;s task. It is you who have given shape to what, I believe, was
      an inherited yearning&mdash;the effect of brooding, passionate thoughts in
      many ancestors&mdash;thoughts that seem to have been intensely present in
      my grandfather. Suppose the stolen offspring of some mountain tribe
      brought up in a city of the plain, or one with an inherited genius for
      painting, and born blind&mdash;the ancestral life would lie within them as
      a dim longing for unknown objects and sensations, and the spell-bound
      habit of their inherited frames would be like a cunningly-wrought musical
      instrument, never played on, but quivering throughout in uneasy mysterious
      meanings of its intricate structure that, under the right touch, gives
      music. Something like that, I think, has been my experience. Since I began
      to read and know, I have always longed for some ideal task, in which I
      might feel myself the heart and brain of a multitude&mdash;some social
      captainship, which would come to me as a duty, and not be striven for as a
      personal prize. You have raised the image of such a task for me&mdash;to
      bind our race together in spite of heresy. You have said to me&mdash;&lsquo;Our
      religion united us before it divided us&mdash;it made us a people before
      it made Rabbanites and Karaites.&rsquo; I mean to try what can be done
      with that union&mdash;I mean to work in your spirit. Failure will not be
      ignoble, but it would be ignoble for me not to try.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even as my brother that fed at the breasts of my mother,&rdquo;
      said Mordecai, falling back in his chair with a look of exultant repose,
      as after some finished labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      To estimate the effect of this ardent outpouring from Deronda we must
      remember his former reserve, his careful avoidance of premature assent or
      delusive encouragement, which gave to this decided pledge of himself a
      sacramental solemnity, both for his own mind and Mordecai&rsquo;s. On
      Mirah the effect was equally strong, though with a difference: she felt a
      surprise which had no place in her brother&rsquo;s mind, at Deronda&rsquo;s
      suddenly revealed sense of nearness to them: there seemed to be a breaking
      of day around her which might show her other facts unlike her forebodings
      in the darkness. But after a moment&rsquo;s silence Mordecai spoke again,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has begun already&mdash;the marriage of our souls. It waits but
      the passing away of this body, and then they who are betrothed shall unite
      in a stricter bond, and what is mine shall be thine. Call nothing mine
      that I have written, Daniel; for though our masters delivered rightly that
      everything should be quoted in the name of him that said it&mdash;and
      their rule is good&mdash;yet it does not exclude the willing marriage
      which melts soul into soul, and makes thought fuller as the clear waters
      are made fuller, where the fullness is inseparable and the clearness is
      inseparable. For I have judged what I have written, and I desire the body
      that I gave my thought to pass away as this fleshly body will pass; but
      let the thought be born again from our fuller soul which shall be called
      yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not ask me to promise that,&rdquo; said Deronda, smiling.
      &ldquo;I must be convinced first of special reasons for it in the writings
      themselves. And I am too backward a pupil yet. That blent transmission
      must go on without any choice of ours; but what we can&rsquo;t hinder must
      not make our rule for what we ought to choose. I think our duty is
      faithful tradition where we can attain it. And so you would insist for any
      one but yourself. Don&rsquo;t ask me to deny my spiritual parentage, when
      I am finding the clue of my life in the recognition of natural parentage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask for no promise till you see the reason,&rdquo; said
      Mordecai. &ldquo;You have said the truth: I would obey the Master&rsquo;s
      rule for another. But for years my hope, nay, my confidence, has been, not
      that the imperfect image of my thought, which is an ill-shaped work of the
      youthful carver who has seen a heavenly pattern, and trembles in imitating
      the vision&mdash;not that this should live, but that my vision and passion
      should enter into yours&mdash;yea, into yours; for he whom I longed for
      afar, was he not you whom I discerned as mine when you came near?
      Nevertheless, you shall judge. For my soul is satisfied.&rdquo; Mordecai
      paused, and then began in a changed tone, reverting to previous
      suggestions from Deronda&rsquo;s disclosure: &ldquo;What moved your
      parents&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; but he immediately checked himself, and
      added, &ldquo;Nay, I ask not that you should tell me aught concerning
      others, unless it is your pleasure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some time&mdash;gradually&mdash;you will know all,&rdquo; said
      Deronda. &ldquo;But now tell me more about yourselves, and how the time
      has passed since I went away. I am sure there has been some trouble. Mirah
      has been in distress about something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Mirah, but she immediately turned to her brother, appealing
      to him to give the difficult answer. She hoped he would not think it
      necessary to tell Deronda the facts about her father on such an evening as
      this. Just when Deronda had brought himself so near, and identified
      himself with her brother, it was cutting to her that he should hear of
      this disgrace clinging about them, which seemed to have become partly his.
      To relieve herself she rose to take up her hat and cloak, thinking she
      would go to her own room: perhaps they would speak more easily when she
      had left them. But meanwhile Mordecai said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day there has been a grief. A duty which seemed to have gone far
      into the distance, has come back and turned its face upon us, and raised
      no gladness&mdash;has raised a dread that we must submit to. But for the
      moment we are delivered from any visible yoke. Let us defer speaking of it
      as if this evening which is deepening about us were the beginning of the
      festival in which we must offer the first fruits of our joy, and mingle no
      mourning with them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda divined the hinted grief, and left it in silence, rising as he saw
      Mirah rise, and saying to her, &ldquo;Are you going? I must leave almost
      immediately&mdash;when I and Mrs. Adam have mounted the precious chest,
      and I have delivered the key to Mordecai&mdash;no, Ezra,&mdash;may I call
      him Ezra now? I have learned to think of him as Ezra since I have heard
      you call him so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please call him Ezra,&rdquo; said Mirah, faintly, feeling a new
      timidity under Deronda&rsquo;s glance and near presence. Was there really
      something different about him, or was the difference only in her feeling?
      The strangely various emotions of the last few hours had exhausted her;
      she was faint with fatigue and want of food. Deronda, observing her pallor
      and tremulousness, longed to show more feeling, but dared not. She put out
      her hand with an effort to smile, and then he opened the door for her.
      That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man of refined pride shrinks from making a lover&rsquo;s approaches to a
      woman whose wealth or rank might make them appear presumptuous or
      low-motived; but Deronda was finding a more delicate difficulty in a
      position which, superficially taken, was the reverse of that&mdash;though
      to an ardent reverential love, the loved woman has always a kind of wealth
      and rank which makes a man keenly susceptible about the aspect of his
      addresses. Deronda&rsquo;s difficulty was what any generous man might have
      felt in some degree; but it affected him peculiarly through his
      imaginative sympathy with a mind in which gratitude was strong. Mirah, he
      knew, felt herself bound to him by deep obligations, which to her
      sensibilities might give every wish of his the aspect of a claim; and an
      inability to fulfill it would cause her a pain continually revived by
      their inevitable communion in care of Ezra. Here were fears not of pride
      only, but of extreme tenderness. Altogether, to have the character of a
      benefactor seemed to Deronda&rsquo;s anxiety an insurmountable obstacle to
      confessing himself a lover, unless in some inconceivable way it could be
      revealed to him that Mirah&rsquo;s heart had accepted him beforehand. And
      the agitation on his own account, too, was not small.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even a man who has practised himself in love-making till his own glibness
      has rendered him sceptical, may at last be overtaken by the lover&rsquo;s
      awe&mdash;may tremble, stammer, and show other signs of recovered
      sensibility no more in the range of his acquired talents than pins and
      needles after numbness: how much more may that energetic timidity possess
      a man whose inward history has cherished his susceptibilities instead of
      dulling them, and has kept all the language of passion fresh and rooted as
      the lovely leafage about the hill-side spring!
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Mirah her dear head lay on its pillow that night with its former
      suspicions thrown out of shape but still present, like an ugly story which
      had been discredited but not therefore dissipated. All that she was
      certain of about Deronda seemed to prove that he had no such fetters upon
      him as she had been allowing herself to believe in. His whole manner as
      well as his words implied that there were no hidden bonds remaining to
      have any effect in determining his future. But notwithstanding this
      plainly reasonable inference, uneasiness still clung about Mirah&rsquo;s
      heart. Deronda was not to blame, but he had an importance for Mrs.
      Grandcourt which must give her some hold on him. And the thought of any
      close confidence between them stirred the little biting snake that had
      long lain curled and harmless in Mirah&rsquo;s gentle bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But did she this evening feel as completely as before that her jealousy
      was no less remote from any possibility for herself personally than if her
      human soul had been lodged in the body of a fawn that Deronda had saved
      from the archers? Hardly. Something indefinable had happened and made a
      difference. The soft warm rain of blossoms which had fallen just where she
      was&mdash;did it really come because she was there? What spirit was there
      among the boughs?

        &ldquo;Questa montagna e tale,
  Che sempre al cominciar di sotto a grave.
  E quanto uom piu va su e men fa male.&rdquo;
                   &mdash;DANTE: <i>Il Purgatorio</i>.

    <p>
      It was not many days after her mother&rsquo;s arrival that Gwendolen would
      consent to remain at Genoa. Her desire to get away from that gem of the
      sea, helped to rally her strength and courage. For what place, though it
      were the flowery vale of Enna, may not the inward sense turn into a circle
      of punishment where the flowers are no better than a crop of flame-tongues
      burning the soles of our feet?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never like to see the Mediterranean again,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, to her mother, who thought that she quite understood her child&rsquo;s
      feeling&mdash;even in her tacit prohibition of any express reference to
      her late husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow, indeed, though compelled formally to regard this time as one
      of severe calamity, was virtually enjoying her life more than she had ever
      done since her daughter&rsquo;s marriage. It seemed that her darling was
      brought back to her not merely with all the old affection, but with a
      conscious cherishing of her mother&rsquo;s nearness, such as we give to a
      possession that we have been on the brink of losing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you there, mamma?&rdquo; cried Gwendolen, in the middle of the
      night (a bed had been made for her mother in the same room with hers),
      very much as she would have done in her early girlhood, if she had felt
      frightened in lying awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear; can I do anything for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you; only I like so to know you are there. Do you mind my
      waking you?&rdquo; (This question would hardly have been Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      in her early girlhood.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not asleep, darling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed not real that you were with me. I wanted to make it real.
      I can bear things if you are with me. But you must not lie awake, anxious
      about me. You must be happy now. You must let me make you happy now at
      last&mdash;else what shall I do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, dear; I have the best happiness I can have, when you
      make much of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next night, hearing that she was sighing and restless Mrs. Davilow
      said, &ldquo;Let me give you your sleeping-draught, Gwendolen.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mamma, thank you; I don&rsquo;t want to sleep.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be so good for you to sleep more, my darling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say what would be good for me, mamma,&rdquo; Gwendolen
      answered, impetuously. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what would be good for
      me. You and my uncle must not contradict me and tell me anything is good
      for me when I feel it is not good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow was silent, not wondering that the poor child was irritable.
      Presently Gwendolen said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was always naughty to you, mamma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear, no.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was,&rdquo; said Gwendolen insistently. &ldquo;It is because
      I was always wicked that I am miserable now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She burst into sobs and cries. The determination to be silent about all
      the facts of her married life and its close, reacted in these escapes of
      enigmatic excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      But dim lights of interpretation were breaking on the mother&rsquo;s mind
      through the information that came from Sir Hugo to Mr. Gascoigne, and,
      with some omissions, from Mr. Gascoigne to herself. The good-natured
      baronet, while he was attending to all decent measures in relation to his
      nephew&rsquo;s death, and the possible washing ashore of the body, thought
      it the kindest thing he could do to use his present friendly intercourse
      with the rector as an opportunity for communicating with him, in the
      mildest way, the purport of Grandcourt&rsquo;s will, so as to save him the
      additional shock that would be in store for him if he carried his
      illusions all the way home. Perhaps Sir Hugo would have been communicable
      enough without that kind motive, but he really felt the motive. He broke
      the unpleasant news to the rector by degrees: at first he only implied his
      fear that the widow was not so splendidly provided for as Mr. Gascoigne,
      nay, as the baronet himself had expected; and only at last, after some
      previous vague reference to large claims on Grandcourt, he disclosed the
      prior relations which, in the unfortunate absence of a legitimate heir,
      had determined all the splendor in another direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector was deeply hurt, and remembered, more vividly than he had ever
      done before, how offensively proud and repelling the manners of the
      deceased had been toward him&mdash;remembered also that he himself, in
      that interesting period just before the arrival of the new occupant at
      Diplow, had received hints of former entangling dissipations, and an undue
      addiction to pleasure, though he had not foreseen that the pleasure which
      had probably, so to speak, been swept into private rubbish-heaps, would
      ever present itself as an array of live caterpillars, disastrous to the
      green meat of respectable people. But he did not make these retrospective
      thoughts audible to Sir Hugo, or lower himself by expressing any
      indignation on merely personal grounds, but behaved like a man of the
      world who had become a conscientious clergyman. His first remark was,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a young man makes his will in health, he usually counts on
      living a long while. Probably Mr. Grandcourt did not believe that this
      will would ever have its present effect.&rdquo; After a moment, he added,
      &ldquo;The effect is painful in more ways than one. Female morality is
      likely to suffer from this marked advantage and prominence being given to
      illegitimate offspring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in point of fact,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo, in his comfortable
      way, &ldquo;since the boy is there, this was really the best alternative
      for the disposal of the estates. Grandcourt had nobody nearer than his
      cousin. And it&rsquo;s a chilling thought that you go out of this life
      only for the benefit of a cousin. A man gets a little pleasure in making
      his will, if it&rsquo;s for the good of his own curly heads; but it&rsquo;s
      a nuisance when you&rsquo;re giving the bequeathing to a used-up fellow
      like yourself, and one you don&rsquo;t care two straws for. It&rsquo;s the
      next worse thing to having only a life interest in your estates. No; I
      forgive Grandcourt for that part of his will. But, between ourselves, what
      I don&rsquo;t forgive him for, is the shabby way he has provided for your
      niece&mdash;<i>our</i> niece, I will say&mdash;no better a position than
      if she had been a doctor&rsquo;s widow. Nothing grates on me more than
      that posthumous grudgingness toward a wife. A man ought to have some pride
      and fondness for his widow. <i>I</i> should, I know. I take it as a test
      of a man, that he feels the easier about his death when he can think of
      his wife and daughters being comfortable after it. I like that story of
      the fellows in the Crimean war, who were ready to go to the bottom of the
      sea if their widows were provided for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has certainly taken me by surprise,&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne,
      &ldquo;all the more because, as the one who stood in the place of father
      to my niece, I had shown my reliance on Mr. Grandcourt&rsquo;s apparent
      liberality in money matters by making no claims for her beforehand. That
      seemed to me due to him under the circumstances. Probably you think me
      blamable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not blamable exactly. I respect a man for trusting another. But
      take my advice. If you marry another niece, though it may be to the
      Archbishop of Canterbury, bind him down. Your niece can&rsquo;t be married
      for the first time twice over. And if he&rsquo;s a good fellow, he&rsquo;ll
      wish to be bound. But as to Mrs. Grandcourt, I can only say that I feel my
      relation to her all the nearer because I think that she has not been well
      treated. And I hope you will urge her to rely on me as a friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus spake the chivalrous Sir Hugo, in his disgust at the young and
      beautiful widow of a Mallinger Grandcourt being left with only two
      thousand a year and a house in a coal-mining district. To the rector that
      income naturally appeared less shabby and less accompanied with mortifying
      privations; but in this conversation he had devoured a much keener sense
      than the baronet&rsquo;s of the humiliation cast over his niece, and also
      over her nearest friends, by the conspicuous publishing of her husband&rsquo;s
      relation to Mrs. Glasher. And like all men who are good husbands and
      fathers, he felt the humiliation through the minds of the women who would
      be chiefly affected by it; so that the annoyance of first hearing the
      facts was far slighter than what he felt in communicating them to Mrs.
      Davilow, and in anticipating Gwendolen&rsquo;s feeling whenever her mother
      saw fit to tell her of them. For the good rector had an innocent
      conviction that his niece was unaware of Mrs. Glasher&rsquo;s existence,
      arguing with masculine soundness from what maidens and wives were likely
      to know, do, and suffer, and having had a most imperfect observation of
      the particular maiden and wife in question. Not so Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      mother, who now thought that she saw an explanation of much that had been
      enigmatic in her child&rsquo;s conduct and words before and after her
      engagement, concluding that in some inconceivable way Gwendolen had been
      informed of this left-handed marriage and the existence of the children.
      She trusted to opportunities that would arise in moments of affectionate
      confidence before and during their journey to England, when she might
      gradually learn how far the actual state of things was clear to Gwendolen,
      and prepare her for anything that might be a disappointment. But she was
      spared from devices on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t expect that I am going to be rich and grand,
      mamma,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, not long after the rector&rsquo;s
      communication; &ldquo;perhaps I shall have nothing at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dressed, and had been sitting long in quiet meditation. Mrs.
      Davilow was startled, but said, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, dear, you will have something. Sir Hugo knows all about the
      will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will not decide,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, dear: Sir Hugo says you are to have two thousand a year and
      the house at Gadsmere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have will depend on what I accept,&rdquo; said Gwendolen.
      &ldquo;You and my uncle must not attempt to cross me and persuade me about
      this. I will do everything I can do to make you happy, but in anything
      about my husband I must not be interfered with. Is eight hundred a year
      enough for you, mamma?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than enough, dear. You must not think of giving me so much.&rdquo;
      Mrs. Davilow paused a little, and then said, &ldquo;Do you know who is to
      have the estates and the rest of the money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, waving her hand in dismissal of the
      subject. &ldquo;I know everything. It is all perfectly right, and I wish
      never to have it mentioned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother was silent, looked away, and rose to fetch a fan-screen, with a
      slight flush on her delicate cheeks. Wondering, imagining, she did not
      like to meet her daughter&rsquo;s eyes, and sat down again under a sad
      constraint. What wretchedness her child had perhaps gone through, which
      yet must remain as it always had been, locked away from their mutual
      speech. But Gwendolen was watching her mother with that new divination
      which experience had given her; and in tender relenting at her own
      peremptoriness, said, &ldquo;Come and sit nearer to me, mamma, and don&rsquo;t
      be unhappy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davilow did as she was told, but bit her lips in the vain attempt to
      hinder smarting tears. Gwendolen leaned toward her caressingly and said,
      &ldquo;I mean to be very wise; I do, really. And good&mdash;oh, so good to
      you, dear, old, sweet mamma, you won&rsquo;t know me. Only you must not
      cry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The resolve that Gwendolen had in her mind was that she would ask Deronda
      whether she ought to accept any of her husband&rsquo;s money&mdash;whether
      she might accept what would enable her to provide for her mother. The poor
      thing felt strong enough to do anything that would give her a higher place
      in Deronda&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      An invitation that Sir Hugo pressed on her with kind urgency was that she
      and Mrs. Davilow should go straight with him to Park Lane, and make his
      house their abode as long as mourning and other details needed attending
      to in London. Town, he insisted, was just then the most retired of places;
      and he proposed to exert himself at once in getting all articles belonging
      to Gwendolen away from the house in Grosvenor Square. No proposal could
      have suited her better than this of staying a little while in Park Lane.
      It would be easy for her there to have an interview with Deronda, if she
      only knew how to get a letter into his hands, asking him to come to her.
      During the journey, Sir Hugo, having understood that she was acquainted
      with the purport of her husband&rsquo;s will, ventured to talk before her
      and to her about her future arrangements, referring here and there to
      mildly agreeable prospects as matters of course, and otherwise shedding a
      decorous cheerfulness over her widowed position. It seemed to him really
      the more graceful course for a widow to recover her spirits on finding
      that her husband had not dealt as handsomely by her as he might have done;
      it was the testator&rsquo;s fault if he compromised all her grief at his
      departure by giving a testamentary reason for it, so that she might be
      supposed to look sad, not because he had left her, but because he had left
      her poor. The baronet, having his kindliness doubly fanned by the
      favorable wind on his fortunes and by compassion for Gwendolen, had become
      quite fatherly in his behavior to her, called her &ldquo;my dear,&rdquo;
      and in mentioning Gadsmere to Mr. Gascoigne, with its various advantages
      and disadvantages, spoke of what &ldquo;we&rdquo; might do to make the
      best of that property. Gwendolen sat by in pale silence while Sir Hugo,
      with his face turned toward Mrs. Davilow or Mr. Gascoigne, conjectured
      that Mrs. Grandcourt might perhaps prefer letting Gadsmere to residing
      there during any part of the year, in which case he thought that it might
      be leased on capital terms to one of the fellows engaged with the coal:
      Sir Hugo had seen enough of the place to know that it was as comfortable
      and picturesque a box as any man need desire, providing his desires were
      circumscribed within a coal area.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> shouldn&rsquo;t mind about the soot myself,&rdquo; said
      the baronet, with that dispassionateness which belongs to the potential
      mood. &ldquo;Nothing is more healthy. And if one&rsquo;s business lay
      there, Gadsmere would be a paradise. It makes quite a feature in Scrogg&rsquo;s
      history of the county, with the little tower and the fine piece of water&mdash;the
      prettiest print in the book.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A more important place than Offendene, I suppose?&rdquo; said Mr.
      Gascoigne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much,&rdquo; said the baronet, decisively. &ldquo;I was there with
      my poor brother&mdash;it is more than a quarter of a century ago, but I
      remember it very well. The rooms may not be larger, but the grounds are on
      a different scale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our poor dear Offendene is empty after all,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Davilow. &ldquo;When it came to the point, Mr. Haynes declared off, and
      there has been no one to take it since. I might as well have accepted Lord
      Brackenshaw&rsquo;s kind offer that I should remain in it another year
      rent-free: for I should have kept the place aired and warmed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve something snug instead,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little too snug,&rdquo; said Mr. Gascoigne, smiling at his
      sister-in-law. &ldquo;You are rather thick upon the ground.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen had turned with a changed glance when her mother spoke of
      Offendene being empty. This conversation passed during one of the long
      unaccountable pauses often experienced in foreign trains at some country
      station. There was a dreamy, sunny stillness over the hedgeless fields
      stretching to the boundary of poplars; and to Gwendolen the talk within
      the carriage seemed only to make the dreamland larger with an indistinct
      region of coal-pits, and a purgatorial Gadsmere which she would never
      visit; till at her mother&rsquo;s words, this mingled, dozing view seemed
      to dissolve and give way to a more wakeful vision of Offendene and
      Pennicote under their cooler lights. She saw the gray shoulders of the
      downs, the cattle-specked fields, the shadowy plantations with rutted
      lanes where the barked timber lay for a wayside seat, the neatly-clipped
      hedges on the road from the parsonage to Offendene, the avenue where she
      was gradually discerned from the window, the hall-door opening, and her
      mother or one of the troublesome sisters coming out to meet her. All that
      brief experience of a quiet home which had once seemed a dullness to be
      fled from, now came back to her as a restful escape, a station where she
      found the breath of morning and the unreproaching voice of birds after
      following a lure through a long Satanic masquerade, which she had entered
      on with an intoxicated belief in its disguises, and had seen the end of in
      shrieking fear lest she herself had become one of the evil spirits who
      were dropping their human mummery and hissing around her with serpent
      tongues.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way Gwendolen&rsquo;s mind paused over Offendene and made it the
      scene of many thoughts; but she gave no further outward sign of interest
      in this conversation, any more than in Sir Hugo&rsquo;s opinion on the
      telegraphic cable or her uncle&rsquo;s views of the Church Rate Abolition
      Bill. What subjects will not our talk embrace in leisurely day-journeying
      from Genoa to London? Even strangers, after glancing from China to Peru
      and opening their mental stores with a liberality threatening a mutual
      impression of poverty on any future meeting, are liable to become
      excessively confidential. But the baronet and the rector were under a
      still stronger pressure toward cheerful communication: they were like
      acquaintances compelled to a long drive in a mourning-coach who having
      first remarked that the occasion is a melancholy one, naturally proceed to
      enliven it by the most miscellaneous discourse. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind
      telling <i>you</i>,&rdquo; said Sir Hugo to the rector, in mentioning some
      private details; while the rector, without saying so, did not mind telling
      the baronet about his sons, and the difficulty of placing them in the
      world. By the dint of discussing all persons and things within
      driving-reach of Diplow, Sir Hugo got himself wrought to a pitch of
      interest in that former home, and of conviction that it was his pleasant
      duty to regain and strengthen his personal influence in the neighborhood,
      that made him declare his intention of taking his family to the place for
      a month or two before the autumn was over; and Mr. Gascoigne cordially
      rejoiced in that prospect. Altogether, the journey was continued and ended
      with mutual liking between the male fellow-travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Gwendolen sat by like one who had visited the spirit-world and
      was full to the lips of an unutterable experience that threw a strange
      unreality over all the talk she was hearing of her own and the world&rsquo;s
      business; and Mrs. Davilow was chiefly occupied in imagining what her
      daughter was feeling, and in wondering what was signified by her hinted
      doubt whether she would accept her husband&rsquo;s bequest. Gwendolen in
      fact had before her the unsealed wall of an immediate purpose shutting off
      every other resolution. How to scale the wall? She wanted again to see and
      consult Deronda, that she might secure herself against any act he would
      disapprove. Would her remorse have maintained its power within her, or
      would she have felt absolved by secrecy, if it had not been for that outer
      conscience which was made for her by Deronda? It is hard to say how much
      we could forgive ourselves if we were secure from judgment by another
      whose opinion is the breathing-medium of all our joy&mdash;who brings to
      us with close pressure and immediate sequence that judgment of the
      Invisible and Universal which self-flattery and the world&rsquo;s
      tolerance would easily melt and disperse. In this way our brother may be
      in the stead of God to us, and his opinion which has pierced even to the
      joints and marrow, may be our virtue in the making. That mission of
      Deronda to Gwendolen had begun with what she had felt to be his judgment
      of her at the gaming-table. He might easily have spoiled it:&mdash;much of
      our lives is spent in marring our own influence and turning others&rsquo;
      belief in us into a widely concluding unbelief which they call knowledge
      of the world, while it is really disappointment in you or me. Deronda had
      not spoiled his mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gwendolen had forgotten to ask him for his address in case she wanted
      to write, and her only way of reaching him was through Sir Hugo. She was
      not in the least blind to the construction that all witnesses might put on
      her giving signs of dependence on Deronda, and her seeking him more than
      he sought her: Grandcourt&rsquo;s rebukes had sufficiently enlightened her
      pride. But the force, the tenacity of her nature had thrown itself into
      that dependence, and she would no more let go her hold on Deronda&rsquo;s
      help, or deny herself the interview her soul needed, because of witnesses,
      than if she had been in prison in danger of being condemned to death. When
      she was in Park Lane and knew that the baronet would be going down to the
      Abbey immediately (just to see his family for a couple of days and then
      return to transact needful business for Gwendolen), she said to him
      without any air of hesitation, while her mother was present,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Hugo, I wish to see Mr. Deronda again as soon as possible. I
      don&rsquo;t know his address. Will you tell it me, or let him know that I
      want to see him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick thought passed across Sir Hugo&rsquo;s face, but made no
      difference to the ease with which he said, &ldquo;Upon my word, I don&rsquo;t
      know whether he&rsquo;s at his chambers or the Abbey at this moment. But I&rsquo;ll
      make sure of him. I&rsquo;ll send a note now to his chambers telling him
      to come, and if he&rsquo;s at the Abbey I can give him your message and
      send him up at once. I am sure he will want to obey your wish,&rdquo; the
      baronet ended, with grave kindness, as if nothing could seem to him more
      in the appropriate course of things than that she should send such a
      message.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was convinced that Gwendolen had a passionate attachment to
      Deronda, the seeds of which had been laid long ago, and his former
      suspicion now recurred to him with more strength than ever, that her
      feeling was likely to lead her into imprudences&mdash;in which
      kind-hearted Sir Hugo was determined to screen and defend her as far as
      lay in his power. To him it was as pretty a story as need be that this
      fine creature and his favorite Dan should have turned out to be formed for
      each other, and that the unsuitable husband should have made his exit in
      such excellent time. Sir Hugo liked that a charming woman should be made
      as happy as possible. In truth, what most vexed his mind in this matter at
      present was a doubt whether the too lofty and inscrutable Dan had not got
      some scheme or other in his head, which would prove to be dearer to him
      than the lovely Mrs. Grandcourt, and put that neatly-prepared marriage
      with her out of the question. It was among the usual paradoxes of feeling
      that Sir Hugo, who had given his fatherly cautions to Deronda against too
      much tenderness in his relations with the bride, should now feel rather
      irritated against him by the suspicion that he had not fallen in love as
      he ought to have done. Of course all this thinking on Sir Hugo&rsquo;s
      part was eminently premature, only a fortnight or so after Grandcourt&rsquo;s
      death. But it is the trick of thinking to be either premature or
      behind-hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he sent the note to Deronda&rsquo;s chambers, and it found him
      there.

      CHAPTER LXV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O, welcome, pure-eyed Faith, white-handed Hope,
  Thou hovering angel, girt with golden wings!&rdquo;
                                          &mdash;MILTON.
</pre>
    <p>
      Deronda did not obey Gwendolen&rsquo;s new summons without some agitation.
      Not his vanity, but his keen sympathy made him susceptible to the danger
      that another&rsquo;s heart might feel larger demands on him than he would
      be able to fulfill; and it was no longer a matter of argument with him,
      but of penetrating consciousness, that Gwendolen&rsquo;s soul clung to his
      with a passionate need. We do not argue the existence of the anger or the
      scorn that thrills through us in a voice; we simply feel it, and it admits
      of no disproof. Deronda felt this woman&rsquo;s destiny hanging on his
      over a precipice of despair. Any one who knows him cannot wonder at his
      inward confession, that if all this had happened little more than a year
      ago, he would hardly have asked himself whether he loved her; the
      impetuous determining impulse which would have moved him would have been
      to save her from sorrow, to shelter her life forevermore from the dangers
      of loneliness, and carry out to the last the rescue he had begun in that
      monitory redemption of the necklace. But now, love and duty had thrown
      other bonds around him, and that impulse could no longer determine his
      life; still, it was present in him as a compassionate yearning, a painful
      quivering at the very imagination of having again and again to meet the
      appeal of her eyes and words. The very strength of the bond, the certainty
      of the resolve, that kept him asunder from her, made him gaze at her lot
      apart with the more aching pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awaited her coming in the back drawing-room&mdash;part of that white
      and crimson space where they had sat together at the musical party, where
      Gwendolen had said for the first time that her lot depended on his not
      forsaking her, and her appeal had seemed to melt into the melodic cry&mdash;<i>Per
      pietà non dirmi addio</i>. But the melody had come from Mirah&rsquo;s dear
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda walked about this room, which he had for years known by heart,
      with a strange sense of metamorphosis in his own life. The familiar
      objects around him, from Lady Mallinger&rsquo;s gently smiling portrait to
      the also human and urbane faces of the lions on the pilasters of the
      chimney-piece, seemed almost to belong to a previous state of existence
      which he was revisiting in memory only, not in reality; so deep and
      transforming had been the impressions he had lately experienced, so new
      were the conditions under which he found himself in the house he had been
      accustomed to think of as a home&mdash;standing with his hat in his hand
      awaiting the entrance of a young creature whose life had also been
      undergoing a transformation&mdash;a tragic transformation toward a
      wavering result, in which he felt with apprehensiveness that his own
      action was still bound up.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gwendolen was come in, looking changed; not only by her mourning
      dress, but by a more satisfied quietude of expression than he had seen in
      her face at Genoa. Her satisfaction was that Deronda was there; but there
      was no smile between them as they met and clasped hands; each was full of
      remembrance&mdash;full of anxious prevision. She said, &ldquo;It was good
      of you to come. Let us sit down,&rdquo; immediately seating herself in the
      nearest chair. He placed himself opposite to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you to come because I want you to tell me what I ought to
      do,&rdquo; she began, at once. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of telling me
      what you think is right, because it seems hard. I have made up my mind to
      do it. I was afraid once of being poor; I could not bear to think of being
      under other people; and that was why I did something&mdash;why I married.
      I have borne worse things now. I think I could bear to be poor, if you
      think I ought. Do you know about my husband&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir Hugo told me,&rdquo; said Deronda, already guessing the
      question she had to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought I to take anything he has left me? I will tell you what I
      have been thinking,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, with a more nervous eagerness.
      &ldquo;Perhaps you may not quite know that I really did think a good deal
      about my mother when I married. I <i>was</i> selfish, but I did love her,
      and feel about her poverty; and what comforted me most at first, when I
      was miserable, was her being better off because I had married. The thing
      that would be hardest to me now would be to see her in poverty again; and
      I have been thinking that if I took enough to provide for her, and no more&mdash;nothing
      for myself&mdash;it would not be wrong; for I was very precious to my
      mother&mdash;and he took me from her&mdash;and he meant&mdash;and if she
      had known&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen broke off. She had been preparing herself for this interview by
      thinking of hardly anything else than this question of right toward her
      mother; but the question had carried with it thoughts and reasons which it
      was impossible for her to utter, and these perilous remembrances swarmed
      between her words, making her speech more and more agitated and tremulous.
      She looked down helplessly at her hands, now unladen of all rings except
      her wedding-ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not hurt yourself by speaking of that,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      tenderly. &ldquo;There is no need; the case is very simple. I think I can
      hardly judge wrongly about it. You consult me because I am the only person
      to whom you have confided the most painful part of your experience: and I
      can understand your scruples.&rdquo; He did not go on immediately, waiting
      for her to recover herself. The silence seemed to Gwendolen full of the
      tenderness that she heard in his voice, and she had courage to lift up her
      eyes and look at him as he said, &ldquo;You are conscious of something
      which you feel to be a crime toward one who is dead. You think that you
      have forfeited all claim as a wife. You shrink from taking what was his.
      You want to keep yourself from profiting by his death. Your feeling even
      urges you to some self-punishment&mdash;some scourging of the self that
      disobeyed your better will&mdash;the will that struggled against
      temptation. I have known something of that myself. Do I understand you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;at least, I want to be good&mdash;not like what I have
      been,&rdquo; said Gwendolen. &ldquo;I will try to bear what you think I
      ought to bear. I have tried to tell you the worst about myself. What ought
      I to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If no one but yourself were concerned in this question of income,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, &ldquo;I should hardly dare to urge you against any
      remorseful prompting; but I take as a guide now, your feeling about Mrs.
      Davilow, which seems to me quite just. I cannot think that your husband&rsquo;s
      dues even to yourself are nullified by any act you have committed. He
      voluntarily entered into your life, and affected its course in what is
      always the most momentous way. But setting that aside, it was due from him
      in his position that he should provide for your mother, and he of course
      understood that if this will took effect she would share the provision he
      had made for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has had eight hundred a year. What I thought of was to take
      that and leave the rest,&rdquo; said Gwendolen. She had been so long
      inwardly arguing for this as a permission, that her mind could not at once
      take another attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is not your duty to fix a limit in that way,&rdquo; said
      Deronda. &ldquo;You would be making a painful enigma for Mrs. Davilow; an
      income from which you shut yourself out must be embittered to her. And
      your own course would become too difficult. We agreed at Genoa that the
      burden on your conscience is one what no one ought to be admitted to the
      knowledge of. The future beneficence of your life will be best furthered
      by your saving all others from the pain of that knowledge. In my opinion
      you ought simply to abide by the provisions of your husband&rsquo;s will,
      and let your remorse tell only on the use that you will make of your
      monetary independence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In uttering the last sentence Deronda automatically took up his hat which
      he had laid on the floor beside him. Gwendolen, sensitive to his slightest
      movement, felt her heart giving a great leap, as if it too had a
      consciousness of its own, and would hinder him from going: in the same
      moment she rose from her chair, unable to reflect that the movement was an
      acceptance of his apparent intention to leave her; and Deronda, of course,
      also rose, advancing a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do what you tell me,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, hurriedly;
      &ldquo;but what else shall I do?&rdquo; No other than these simple words
      were possible to her; and even these were too much for her in a state of
      emotion where her proud secrecy was disenthroned: as the child-like
      sentences fell from her lips they re-acted on her like a picture of her
      own helplessness, and she could not check the sob which sent the large
      tears to her eyes. Deronda, too, felt a crushing pain; but imminent
      consequences were visible to him, and urged him to the utmost exertion of
      conscience. When she had pressed her tears away, he said, in a gently
      questioning tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will probably be soon going with Mrs. Davilow into the country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in a week or ten days.&rdquo; Gwendolen waited an instant,
      turning her eyes vaguely toward the window, as if looking at some imagined
      prospect. &ldquo;I want to be kind to them all&mdash;they can be happier
      than I can. Is that the best I can do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. It is a duty that cannot be doubtful,&rdquo; said
      Deronda. He paused a little between his sentences, feeling a weight of
      anxiety on all his words. &ldquo;Other duties will spring from it. Looking
      at your life as a debt may seem the dreariest view of things at a
      distance; but it cannot really be so. What makes life dreary is the want
      of motive: but once beginning to act with that penitential, loving purpose
      you have in your mind, there will be unexpected satisfactions&mdash;there
      will be newly-opening needs&mdash;continually coming to carry you on from
      day to day. You will find your life growing like a plant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen turned her eyes on him with the look of one athirst toward the
      sound of unseen waters. Deronda felt the look as if she had been
      stretching her arms toward him from a forsaken shore. His voice took an
      affectionate imploringness when he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This sorrow, which has cut down to the root, has come to you while
      you are so young&mdash;try to think of it not as a spoiling of your life,
      but as a preparation for it. Let it be a preparation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      Any one overhearing his tones would have thought he was entreating for his
      own happiness. &ldquo;See! you have been saved from the worst evils that
      might have come from your marriage, which you feel was wrong. You have had
      a vision of injurious, selfish action&mdash;a vision of possible
      degradation; think that a severe angel, seeing you along the road of
      error, grasped you by the wrist and showed you the horror of the life you
      must avoid. And it has come to you in your spring-time. Think of it as a
      preparation. You can, you will, be among the best of women, such as make
      others glad that they were born.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were like the touch of a miraculous hand to Gwendolen. Mingled
      emotions streamed through her frame with a strength that seemed the
      beginning of a new existence, having some new power or other which stirred
      in her vaguely. So pregnant is the divine hope of moral recovery with the
      energy that fulfills it. So potent in us is the infused action of another
      soul, before which we bow in complete love. But the new existence seemed
      inseparable from Deronda: the hope seemed to make his presence permanent.
      It was not her thought, that he loved her, and would cling to her&mdash;a
      thought would have tottered with improbability; it was her spiritual
      breath. For the first time since that terrible moment on the sea a flush
      rose and spread over her cheek, brow and neck, deepened an instant or two,
      and then gradually disappeared. She did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda advanced and put out his hand, saying, &ldquo;I must not weary
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was startled by the sense that he was going, and put her hand in his,
      still without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look ill yet&mdash;unlike yourself,&rdquo; he added, while he
      held her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep much,&rdquo; she answered, with some return of
      her dispirited manner. &ldquo;Things repeat themselves in me so. They come
      back&mdash;they will all come back,&rdquo; she ended, shudderingly, a
      chill fear threatening her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By degrees they will be less insistent,&rdquo; said Deronda. He
      could not drop her hand or move away from her abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Hugo says he shall come to stay at Diplow,&rdquo; said
      Gwendolen, snatching at previously intended words which had slipped away
      from her. &ldquo;You will come too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; said Deronda, and then feeling that the word was
      cold, he added, correctively, &ldquo;Yes, I shall come,&rdquo; and then
      released her hand, with the final friendly pressure of one who has
      virtually said good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not again here, before I leave town?&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      with timid sadness, looking as pallid as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could Deronda say? &ldquo;If I can be of any use&mdash;if you wish me&mdash;certainly
      I will.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must wish it,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, impetuously; &ldquo;you know
      I must wish it. What strength have I? Who else is there?&rdquo; Again a
      sob was rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda felt a pang, which showed itself in his face. He looked miserable
      as he said, &ldquo;I will certainly come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen perceived the change in his face; but the intense relief of
      expecting him to come again could not give way to any other feeling, and
      there was a recovery of the inspired hope and courage in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be unhappy about me,&rdquo; she said, in a tone of
      affectionate assurance. &ldquo;I shall remember your words&mdash;every one
      of them. I shall remember what you believe about me; I shall try.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him firmly, and put out her hand again as if she had
      forgotten what had passed since those words of his which she promised to
      remember. But there was no approach to a smile on her lips. She had never
      smiled since her husband&rsquo;s death. When she stood still and in
      silence, she looked like a melancholy statue of the Gwendolen whose
      laughter had once been so ready when others were grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only by remembering the searching anguish which had changed the
      aspect of the world for her that we can understand her behavior to Deronda&mdash;the
      unreflecting openness, nay, the importunate pleading, with which she
      expressed her dependence on him. Considerations such as would have filled
      the minds of indifferent spectators could not occur to her, any more than
      if flames had been mounting around her, and she had flung herself into his
      open arms and clung about his neck that he might carry her into safety.
      She identified him with the struggling regenerative process in her which
      had begun with his action. Is it any wonder that she saw her own necessity
      reflected in his feeling? She was in that state of unconscious reliance
      and expectation which is a common experience with us when we are
      preoccupied with our own trouble or our own purposes. We diffuse our
      feeling over others, and count on their acting from our motives. Her
      imagination had not been turned to a future union with Deronda by any
      other than the spiritual tie which had been continually strengthening; but
      also it had not been turned toward a future separation from him.
      Love-making and marriage&mdash;how could they now be the imagery in which
      poor Gwendolen&rsquo;s deepest attachment could spontaneously clothe
      itself? Mighty Love had laid his hand upon her; but what had he demanded
      of her? Acceptance of rebuke&mdash;the hard task of self-change&mdash;confession&mdash;endurance.
      If she cried toward him, what then? She cried as the child cries whose
      little feet have fallen backward&mdash;cried to be taken by the hand, lest
      she should lose herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry pierced Deronda. What position could have been more difficult for
      a man full of tenderness, yet with clear foresight? He was the only
      creature who knew the real nature of Gwendolen&rsquo;s trouble: to
      withdraw himself from any appeal of hers would be to consign her to a
      dangerous loneliness. He could not reconcile himself to the cruelty of
      apparently rejecting her dependence on him; and yet in the nearer or
      farther distance he saw a coming wrench, which all present strengthening
      of their bond would make the harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was obliged to risk that. He went once and again to Park Lane before
      Gwendolen left; but their interviews were in the presence of Mrs. Davilow,
      and were therefore less agitating. Gwendolen, since she had determined to
      accept her income, had conceived a project which she liked to speak of: it
      was to place her mother and sisters with herself in Offendene again, and,
      as she said, piece back her life unto that time when they first went
      there, and when everything was happiness about her, only she did not know
      it. The idea had been mentioned to Sir Hugo, who was going to exert
      himself about the letting of Gadsmere for a rent which would more than pay
      the rent of Offendene. All this was told to Deronda, who willingly dwelt
      on a subject that seemed to give some soothing occupation to Gwendolen. He
      said nothing and she asked nothing, of what chiefly occupied himself. Her
      mind was fixed on his coming to Diplow before the autumn was over; and she
      no more thought of the Lapidoths&mdash;the little Jewess and her brother&mdash;as
      likely to make a difference in her destiny, than of the fermenting
      political and social leaven which was making a difference in the history
      of the world. In fact poor Gwendolen&rsquo;s memory had been stunned, and
      all outside the lava-lit track of her troubled conscience, and her effort
      to get deliverance from it, lay for her in dim forgetfulness.

      CHAPTER LXVI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;One day still fierce &lsquo;mid many a day struck calm.&rdquo;
                     &mdash;BROWNING: <i>The King and the Book</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Ezra and Mirah, whom Gwendolen did not include in her thinking
      about Deronda, were having their relation to him drawn closer and brought
      into fuller light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father Lapidoth had quitted his daughter at the doorstep, ruled by
      that possibility of staking something in play or betting which presented
      itself with the handling of any sum beyond the price of staying actual
      hunger, and left no care for alternative prospects or resolutions. Until
      he had lost everything he never considered whether he would apply to Mirah
      again or whether he would brave his son&rsquo;s presence. In the first
      moment he had shrunk from encountering Ezra as he would have shrunk from
      any other situation of disagreeable constraint; and the possession of
      Mirah&rsquo;s purse was enough to banish the thought of future
      necessities. The gambling appetite is more absolutely dominant than bodily
      hunger, which can be neutralized by an emotional or intellectual
      excitation; but the passion for watching chances&mdash;the habitual
      suspensive poise of the mind in actual or imaginary play&mdash;nullifies
      the susceptibility of other excitation. In its final, imperious stage, it
      seems the unjoyous dissipation of demons, seeking diversion on the burning
      marl of perdition.
    </p>
    <p>
      But every form of selfishness, however abstract and unhuman, requires the
      support of at least one meal a day; and though Lapidoth&rsquo;s appetite
      for food and drink was extremely moderate, he had slipped into a shabby,
      unfriendly form of life in which the appetite could not be satisfied
      without some ready money. When, in a brief visit at a house which
      announced &ldquo;Pyramids&rdquo; on the window-blind, he had first doubled
      and trebled and finally lost Mirah&rsquo;s thirty shillings, he went out
      with her empty purse in his pocket, already balancing in his mind whether
      he should get another immediate stake by pawning the purse, or whether he
      should go back to her giving himself a good countenance by restoring the
      purse, and declaring that he had used the money in paying a score that was
      standing against him. Besides, among the sensibilities still left strong
      in Lapidoth was the sensibility to his own claims, and he appeared to
      himself to have a claim on any property his children might possess, which
      was stronger than the justice of his son&rsquo;s resentment. After all, to
      take up his lodging with his children was the best thing he could do; and
      the more he thought of meeting Ezra the less he winced from it, his
      imagination being more wrought on by the chances of his getting something
      into his pocket with safety and without exertion, than by the threat of a
      private humiliation. Luck had been against him lately; he expected it to
      turn&mdash;and might not the turn begin with some opening of supplies
      which would present itself through his daughter&rsquo;s affairs and the
      good friends she had spoken of? Lapidoth counted on the fascination of his
      cleverness&mdash;an old habit of mind which early experience had
      sanctioned: and it is not only women who are unaware of their diminished
      charm, or imagine that they can feign not to be worn out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of Lapidoth&rsquo;s rapid balancing was that he went toward the
      little square in Brompton with the hope that, by walking about and
      watching, he might catch sight of Mirah going out or returning, in which
      case his entrance into the house would be made easier. But it was already
      evening&mdash;the evening of the day next to that which he had first seen
      her; and after a little waiting, weariness made him reflect that he might
      ring, and if she were not at home he might ask the time at which she was
      expected. But on coming near the house he knew that she was at home: he
      heard her singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah, seated at the piano, was pouring forth &ldquo;<i>Herz, mein Herz</i>,&rdquo;
      while Ezra was listening with his eyes shut, when Mrs. Adam opened the
      door, and said in some embarrassment,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman below says he is your father, miss.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go down to him,&rdquo; said Mirah, starting up immediately
      and looking at her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mirah, not so,&rdquo; said Ezra, with decision. &ldquo;Let him
      come up, Mrs. Adam.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mirah stood with her hands pinching each other, and feeling sick with
      anxiety, while she continued looking at Ezra, who had also risen, and was
      evidently much shaken. But there was an expression in his face which she
      had never seen before; his brow was knit, his lips seemed hardened with
      the same severity that gleamed from his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Adam opened the door to let in the father, she could not help
      casting a look at the group, and after glancing from the younger man to
      the elder, said to herself as she closed the door, &ldquo;Father, sure
      enough.&rdquo; The likeness was that of outline, which is always most
      striking at the first moment; the expression had been wrought into the
      strongest contrasts by such hidden or inconspicuous differences as can
      make the genius of a Cromwell within the outward type of a father who was
      no more than a respectable parishioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lapidoth had put on a melancholy expression beforehand, but there was some
      real wincing in his frame as he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ezra, my boy, you hardly know me after so many years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you&mdash;too well&mdash;father,&rdquo; said Ezra, with a
      slow biting solemnity which made the word father a reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are not pleased with me. I don&rsquo;t wonder at it.
      Appearances have been against me. When a man gets into straits he can&rsquo;t
      do just as he would by himself or anybody else, <i>I</i>&rsquo;ve suffered
      enough, I know,&rdquo; said Lapidoth, quickly. In speaking he always
      recovered some glibness and hardihood; and now turning toward Mirah, he
      held out her purse, saying, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your little purse, my
      dear. I thought you&rsquo;d be anxious about it because of that bit of
      writing. I&rsquo;ve emptied it, you&rsquo;ll see, for I had a score to pay
      for food and lodging. I knew you would like me to clear myself, and here I
      stand&mdash;without a single farthing in my pocket&mdash;at the mercy of
      my children. You can turn me out if you like, without getting a policeman.
      Say the word, Mirah; say, &lsquo;Father, I&rsquo;ve had enough of you; you
      made a pet of me, and spent your all on me, when I couldn&rsquo;t have
      done without you; but I can do better without you now,&rsquo;&mdash;say
      that, and I&rsquo;m gone out like a spark. I shan&rsquo;t spoil your
      pleasure again.&rdquo; The tears were in his voice as usual, before he had
      finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I could never say it, father,&rdquo; answered Mirah, with
      not the less anguish because she felt the falsity of everything in his
      speech except the implied wish to remain in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mirah, my sister, leave us!&rdquo; said Ezra, in a tone of
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at her brother falteringly, beseechingly&mdash;in awe of his
      decision, yet unable to go without making a plea for this father who was
      like something that had grown in her flesh with pain. She went close to
      her brother, and putting her hand in his, said, in a low voice, but not so
      low as to be unheard by Lapidoth, &ldquo;Remember, Ezra&mdash;you said my
      mother would not have shut him out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust me, and go,&rdquo; said Ezra.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left the room, but after going a few steps up the stairs, sat down
      with a palpitating heart. If, because of anything her brother said to him,
      he went away&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lapidoth had some sense of what was being prepared for him in his son&rsquo;s
      mind, but he was beginning to adjust himself to the situation and find a
      point of view that would give him a cool superiority to any attempt at
      humiliating him. This haggard son, speaking as from a sepulchre, had the
      incongruity which selfish levity learns to see in suffering, and until the
      unrelenting pincers of disease clutch its own flesh. Whatever preaching he
      might deliver must be taken for a matter of course, as a man finding
      shelter from hail in an open cathedral might take a little religious
      howling that happened to be going on there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lapidoth was not born with this sort of callousness: he had achieved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This home that we have here,&rdquo; Ezra began, &ldquo;is
      maintained partly by the generosity of a beloved friend who supports me,
      and partly by the labors of my sister, who supports herself. While we have
      a home we will not shut you out from it. We will not cast you out to the
      mercy of your vices. For you are our father, and though you have broken
      your bond, we acknowledge ours. But I will never trust you. You absconded
      with money, leaving your debts unpaid; you forsook my mother; you robbed
      her of her little child and broke her heart; you have become a gambler,
      and where shame and conscience were there sits an insatiable desire; you
      were ready to sell my sister&mdash;you had sold her, but the price was
      denied you. The man who has done these things must never expect to be
      trusted any more. We will share our food with you&mdash;you shall have a
      bed, and clothing. We will do this duty to you, because you are our
      father. But you will never be trusted. You are an evil man: you made the
      misery of our mother. That such a man is our father is a brand on our
      flesh which will not cease smarting. But the Eternal has laid it upon us;
      and though human justice were to flog you for crimes, and your body fell
      helpless before the public scorn, we would still say, &lsquo;This is our
      father; make way, that we may carry him out of your sight.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lapidoth, in adjusting himself to what was coming, had not been able to
      foresee the exact intensity of the lightning or the exact course it would
      take&mdash;that it would not fall outside his frame but through it. He
      could not foresee what was so new to him as this voice from the soul of
      his son. It touched that spring of hysterical excitability which Mirah
      used to witness in him when he sat at home and sobbed. As Ezra ended,
      Lapidoth threw himself into a chair and cried like a woman, burying his
      face against the table&mdash;and yet, strangely, while this hysterical
      crying was an inevitable reaction in him under the stress of his son&rsquo;s
      words, it was also a conscious resource in a difficulty; just as in early
      life, when he was a bright-faced curly young man, he had been used to
      avail himself of this subtly-poised physical susceptibility to turn the
      edge of resentment or disapprobation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezra sat down again and said nothing&mdash;exhausted by the shock of his
      own irrepressible utterance, the outburst of feelings which for years he
      had borne in solitude and silence. His thin hands trembled on the arms of
      the chair; he would hardly have found voice to answer a question; he felt
      as if he had taken a step toward beckoning Death. Meanwhile Mirah&rsquo;s
      quick expectant ear detected a sound which her heart recognized: she could
      not stay out of the room any longer. But on opening the door her immediate
      alarm was for Ezra, and it was to his side that she went, taking his
      trembling hand in hers, which he pressed and found support in; but he did
      not speak or even look at her. The father with his face buried was
      conscious that Mirah had entered, and presently lifted up his head,
      pressed his handkerchief against his eyes, put out his hand toward her,
      and said with plaintive hoarseness, &ldquo;Good-bye, Mirah; your father
      will not trouble you again. He deserves to die like a dog by the roadside,
      and he will. If your mother had lived, she would have forgiven me&mdash;thirty-four
      years ago I put the ring on her finger under the <i>Chuppa</i>, and we
      were made one. She would have forgiven me, and we should have spent our
      old age together. But I haven&rsquo;t deserved it. Good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from the chair as he said the last &ldquo;good-bye.&rdquo; Mirah
      had put her hand in his and held him. She was not tearful and grieving,
      but frightened and awe-struck, as she cried out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father, no!&rdquo; Then turning to her brother, &ldquo;Ezra,
      you have not forbidden him?&mdash;Stay, father, and leave off wrong
      things. Ezra, I cannot bear it. How can I say to my father, &lsquo;Go and
      die!&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not said it,&rdquo; Ezra answered, with great effort.
      &ldquo;I have said, stay and be sheltered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will stay, father&mdash;and be taken care of&mdash;and
      come with me,&rdquo; said Mirah, drawing him toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was really what Lapidoth wanted. And for the moment he felt a sort of
      comfort in recovering his daughter&rsquo;s dutiful attendance, that made a
      change of habits seem possible to him. She led him down to the parlor
      below, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my sitting-room when I am not with Ezra, and there is a
      bed-room behind which shall be yours. You will stay and be good, father.
      Think that you are come back to my mother, and that she has forgiven you&mdash;she
      speaks to you through me.&rdquo; Mirah&rsquo;s tones were imploring, but
      she could not give one of her former caresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lapidoth quickly recovered his composure, began to speak to Mirah of the
      improvement in her voice, and other easy subjects, and when Mrs. Adam came
      to lay out his supper, entered into converse with her in order to show her
      that he was not a common person, though his clothes were just now against
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in his usual wakefulness at night, he fell to wondering what money
      Mirah had by her, and went back over old Continental hours at <i>Roulette</i>,
      reproducing the method of his play, and the chances that had frustrated
      it. He had had his reasons for coming to England, but for most things it
      was a cursed country.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the stronger visions of the night with Lapidoth, and not the
      worn frame of his ireful son uttering a terrible judgment. Ezra did pass
      across the gaming-table, and his words were audible; but he passed like an
      insubstantial ghost, and his words had the heart eaten out of them by
      numbers and movements that seemed to make the very tissue of Lapidoth&rsquo;s
      consciousness.

    <p>
      It was an unpleasant surprise to Deronda when he returned from the Abbey
      to find the undesirable father installed in the lodgings at Brompton.
      Mirah had felt it necessary to speak of Deronda to her father, and even to
      make him as fully aware as she could of the way in which the friendship
      with Ezra had begun, and of the sympathy which had cemented it. She passed
      more lightly over what Deronda had done for her, omitting altogether the
      rescue from drowning, and speaking of the shelter she had found in Mrs.
      Meyrick&rsquo;s family so as to leave her father to suppose that it was
      through these friends Deronda had become acquainted with her. She could
      not persuade herself to more completeness in her narrative: she could not
      let the breath of her father&rsquo;s soul pass over her relation to
      Deronda. And Lapidoth, for reasons, was not eager in his questioning about
      the circumstances of her flight and arrival in England. But he was much
      interested in the fact of his children having a beneficent friend
      apparently high in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the brother who told Deronda of this new condition added to their
      life. &ldquo;I am become calm in beholding him now,&rdquo; Ezra ended,
      &ldquo;and I try to think it possible that my sister&rsquo;s tenderness,
      and the daily tasting a life of peace, may win him to remain aloof from
      temptation. I have enjoined her, and she has promised, to trust him with
      no money. I have convinced her that he will buy with it his own
      destruction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda first came on the third day from Ladipoth&rsquo;s arrival. The new
      clothes for which he had been measured were not yet ready, and wishing to
      make a favorable impression, he did not choose to present himself in the
      old ones. He watched for Deronda&rsquo;s departure, and, getting a view of
      him from the window, was rather surprised at his youthfulness, which Mirah
      had not mentioned, and which he had somehow thought out of the question in
      a personage who had taken up a grave friendship and hoary studies with the
      sepulchral Ezra. Lapidoth began to imagine that Deronda&rsquo;s real or
      chief motive must be that he was in love with Mirah. And so much the
      better; for a tie to Mirah had more promise of indulgence for her father
      than a tie to Ezra: and Lapidoth was not without the hope of recommending
      himself to Deronda, and of softening any hard prepossessions. He was
      behaving with much amiability, and trying in all ways at his command to
      get himself into easy domestication with his children&mdash;entering into
      Mirah&rsquo;s music, showing himself docile about smoking, which Mrs. Adam
      could not tolerate in her parlor, and walking out in the square with his
      German pipe, and the tobacco with which Mirah supplied him. He was too
      acute to offer any present remonstrance against the refusal of money,
      which Mirah told him that she must persist in as a solemn duty promised to
      her brother. He was comfortable enough to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time Deronda came, Lapidoth, equipped in his new clothes, and
      satisfied with his own appearance, was in the room with Ezra, who was
      teaching himself, as a part of his severe duty, to tolerate his father&rsquo;s
      presence whenever it was imposed. Deronda was cold and distant, the first
      sight of this man, who had blighted the lives of his wife and children,
      creating in him a repulsion that was even a physical discomfort. But
      Lapidoth did not let himself be discouraged, asked leave to stay and hear
      the reading of papers from the old chest, and actually made himself useful
      in helping to decipher some difficult German manuscript. This led him to
      suggest that it might be desirable to make a transcription of the
      manuscript, and he offered his services for this purpose, and also to make
      copies of any papers in Roman characters. Though Ezra&rsquo;s young eyes
      he observed were getting weak, his own were still strong. Deronda accepted
      the offer, thinking that Lapidoth showed a sign of grace in the
      willingness to be employed usefully; and he saw a gratified expression in
      Ezra&rsquo;s face, who, however, presently said, &ldquo;Let all the
      writing be done here; for I cannot trust the papers out of my sight, lest
      there be an accident by burning or otherwise.&rdquo; Poor Ezra felt very
      much as if he had a convict on leave under his charge. Unless he saw his
      father working, it was not possible to believe that he would work in good
      faith. But by this arrangement he fastened on himself the burden of his
      father&rsquo;s presence, which was made painful not only through his
      deepest, longest associations, but also through Lapidoth&rsquo;s
      restlessness of temperament, which showed itself the more as he become
      familiarized with his situation, and lost any awe he had felt of his son.
      The fact was, he was putting a strong constraint on himself in confining
      his attention for the sake of winning Deronda&rsquo;s favor; and like a
      man in an uncomfortable garment he gave himself relief at every
      opportunity, going out to smoke, or moving about and talking, or throwing
      himself back in his chair and remaining silent, but incessantly carrying
      on a dumb language of facial movement or gesticulation: and if Mirah were
      in the room, he would fall into his old habit of talk with her, gossiping
      about their former doings and companions, or repeating quirks and stories,
      and plots of the plays he used to adapt, in the belief that he could at
      will command the vivacity of his earlier time. All this was a mortal
      infliction to Ezra; and when Mirah was at home she tried to relieve him,
      by getting her father down into the parlor and keeping watch over him
      there. What duty is made of a single difficult resolve? The difficulty
      lies in the daily unflinching support of consequences that mar the blessed
      return of morning with the prospect of irritation to be suppressed or
      shame to be endured. And such consequences were being borne by these, as
      by many other heroic children of an unworthy father&mdash;with the
      prospect, at least to Mirah, of their stretching onward through the solid
      part of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Lapidoth&rsquo;s presence had raised a new impalpable partition
      between Deronda and Mirah&mdash;each of them dreading the soiling
      inferences of his mind, each of them interpreting mistakenly the increased
      reserve and diffidence of the other. But it was not very long before some
      light came to Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he could, after returning from his brief visit to the Abbey, he
      had called at Hans Meyrick&rsquo;s rooms, feeling it, on more grounds than
      one, a due of friendship that Hans should be at once acquainted with the
      reasons of his late journey, and the changes of intention it had brought
      about. Hans was not there; he was said to be in the country for a few
      days; and Deronda, after leaving a note, waited a week, rather expecting a
      note in return. But receiving no word, and fearing some freak of feeling
      in the incalculably susceptible Hans, whose proposed sojourn at the Abbey
      he knew had been deferred, he at length made a second call, and was
      admitted into the painting-room, where he found his friend in a light
      coat, without a waistcoat, his long hair still wet from a bath, but with a
      face looking worn and wizened&mdash;anything but country-like. He had
      taken up his palette and brushes, and stood before his easel when Deronda
      entered, but the equipment and attitude seemed to have been got up on
      short notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they shook hands, Deronda said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look much as if
      you had been in the country, old fellow. Is it Cambridge you have been to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hans, curtly, throwing down his palette with the
      air of one who has begun to feign by mistake; then pushing forward a chair
      for Deronda, he threw himself into another, and leaned backward with his
      hands behind his head, while he went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to I-don&rsquo;t-know-where&mdash;No
      man&rsquo;s land&mdash;and a mortally unpleasant country it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you have been drinking, Hans,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, who had seated himself opposite, in anxious survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing so good. I&rsquo;ve been smoking opium. I always meant to
      do it some time or other, to try how much bliss could be got by it; and
      having found myself just now rather out of other bliss, I thought it
      judicious to seize the opportunity. But I pledge you my word I shall never
      tap a cask of that bliss again. It disagrees with my constitution.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has been the matter? You were in good spirits enough when you
      wrote to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing in particular. The world began to look seedy&mdash;a
      sort of cabbage-garden with all the cabbages cut. A malady of genius, you
      may be sure,&rdquo; said Hans, creasing his face into a smile; &ldquo;and,
      in fact, I was tired of being virtuous without reward, especially in this
      hot London weather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing else? No real vexation?&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hans shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to tell you of my own affairs, but I can&rsquo;t do it with
      a good grace if you are to hide yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t an affair in the world,&rdquo; said Hans, in a
      flighty way, &ldquo;except a quarrel with a bric-à-brac man. Besides, as
      it is the first time in our lives that you ever spoke to me about your own
      affairs, you are only beginning to pay a pretty long debt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda felt convinced that Hans was behaving artificially, but he trusted
      to a return of the old frankness by-and-by if he gave his own confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You laughed at the mystery of my journey to Italy, Hans,&rdquo; he
      began. &ldquo;It was for an object that touched my happiness at the very
      roots. I had never known anything about my parents, and I really went to
      Genoa to meet my mother. My father has been long dead&mdash;died when I
      was an infant. My mother was the daughter of an eminent Jew; my father was
      her cousin. Many things had caused me to think of this origin as almost a
      probability before I set out. I was so far prepared for the result that I
      was glad of it&mdash;glad to find myself a Jew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not expect me to look surprised, Deronda,&rdquo; said
      Hans, who had changed his attitude, laying one leg across the other and
      examining the heel of his slipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother told me. She went to the house the morning after you had
      been there&mdash;brother and sister both told her. You may imagine we can&rsquo;t
      rejoice as they do. But whatever you are glad of, I shall come to be glad
      of in the end&mdash;<i>when</i> exactly the end may be I can&rsquo;t
      predict,&rdquo; said Hans, speaking in a low tone, which was as usual with
      him as it was to be out of humor with his lot, and yet bent on making no
      fuss about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite understand that you can&rsquo;t share my feeling,&rdquo;
      said Deronda; &ldquo;but I could not let silence lie between us on what
      casts quite a new light over my future. I have taken up some of Mordecai&rsquo;s
      ideas, and I mean to try and carry them out, so far as one man&rsquo;s
      efforts can go. I dare say I shall by and by travel to the East and be
      away for some years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hans said nothing, but rose, seized his palette and began to work his
      brush on it, standing before his picture with his back to Deronda, who
      also felt himself at a break in his path embarrassed by Hans&rsquo;s
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Hans said, again speaking low, and without turning, &ldquo;Excuse
      the question, but does Mrs. Grandcourt know of all this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; and I must beg of you, Hans,&rdquo; said Deronda, rather
      angrily, &ldquo;to cease joking on that subject. Any notions you have are
      wide of the truth&mdash;are the very reverse of the truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no more inclined to joke than I shall be at my own funeral,&rdquo;
      said Hans. &ldquo;But I am not at all sure that you are aware what are my
      notions on that subject.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;But let me say, once for
      all, that in relation to Mrs. Grandcourt, I never have had, and never
      shall have the position of a lover. If you have ever seriously put that
      interpretation on anything you have observed, you are supremely mistaken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence a little while, and to each the silence was like an
      irritating air, exaggerating discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I have been mistaken in another interpretation, also,&rdquo;
      said Hans, presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you had no wish to hold the position of a lover toward another
      woman, who is neither wife nor widow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pretend not to understand you, Meyrick. It is painful
      that our wishes should clash. I hope you will tell me if you have any
      ground for supposing that you would succeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems rather a superfluous inquiry on your part, Deronda,&rdquo;
      said Hans, with some irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why superfluous?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are perfectly convinced on the subject&mdash;and
      probably have had the very best evidence to convince you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be more frank with you than you are with me,&rdquo; said
      Deronda, still heated by Hans&rsquo; show of temper, and yet sorry for
      him. &ldquo;I have never had the slightest evidence that I should succeed
      myself. In fact, I have very little hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hans looked round hastily at his friend, but immediately turned to his
      picture again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in our present situation,&rdquo; said Deronda, hurt by the idea
      that Hans suspected him of insincerity, and giving an offended emphasis to
      his words, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I can deliberately make known my
      feeling to her. If she could not return it, I should have embittered her
      best comfort; for neither she nor I can be parted from her brother, and we
      should have to meet continually. If I were to cause her that sort of pain
      by an unwilling betrayal of my feeling, I should be no better than a
      mischievous animal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I have ever betrayed <i>my</i> feeling to
      her,&rdquo; said Hans, as if he were vindicating himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that we are on a level, then; you have no reason to envy
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not the slightest,&rdquo; said Hans, with bitter irony. &ldquo;You
      have measured my conceit and know that it out-tops all your advantages.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a nuisance to you, Meyrick. I am sorry, but I can&rsquo;t help
      it,&rdquo; said Deronda, rising. &ldquo;After what passed between us
      before, I wished to have this explanation; and I don&rsquo;t see that any
      pretensions of mine have made a real difference to you. They are not
      likely to make any pleasant difference to myself under present
      circumstances. Now the father is there&mdash;did you know that the father
      is there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. If he were not a Jew I would permit myself to damn him&mdash;with
      faint praise, I mean,&rdquo; said Hans, but with no smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She and I meet under greater constraint than ever. Things might go
      on in this way for two years without my getting any insight into her
      feeling toward me. That is the whole state of affairs, Hans. Neither you
      nor I have injured the other, that I can see. We must put up with this
      sort of rivalry in a hope that is likely enough to come to nothing. Our
      friendship can bear that strain, surely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Hans, impetuously, throwing down
      his tools, thrusting his hands into his coat-pockets, and turning round to
      face Deronda, who drew back a little and looked at him with amazement.
      Hans went on in the same tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friendship&mdash;my friendship&mdash;can&rsquo;t bear the
      strain of behaving to you like an ungrateful dastard and grudging you your
      happiness. For you <i>are</i> the happiest dog in the world. If Mirah
      loves anybody better than her brother, <i>you are the man</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hans turned on his heel and threw himself into his chair, looking up at
      Deronda with an expression the reverse of tender. Something like a shock
      passed through Deronda, and, after an instant, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a good-natured fiction of yours, Hans.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in a good-natured mood. I assure you I found the fact
      disagreeable when it was thrust on me&mdash;all the more, or perhaps all
      the less, because I believed then that your heart was pledged to the
      duchess. But now, confound you! you turn out to be in love in the right
      place&mdash;a Jew&mdash;and everything eligible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what convinced you&mdash;there&rsquo;s a good fellow,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, distrusting a delight that he was unused to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask. Little mother was witness. The upshot is, that
      Mirah is jealous of the duchess, and the sooner you relieve your mind the
      better. There! I&rsquo;ve cleared off a score or two, and may be allowed
      to swear at you for getting what you deserve&mdash;which is just the very
      best luck I know of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, Hans!&rdquo; said Deronda, putting out his hand,
      which the other took and wrung in silence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXVIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;All thoughts, all passions, all delights,
  Whatever stirs this mortal frame,
  All are but ministers of Love,
  And feed his sacred flame.&rdquo;
                                 &mdash;COLERIDGE.
</pre>
    <p>
      Deronda&rsquo;s eagerness to confess his love could hardly have had a
      stronger stimulus than Hans had given it in his assurance that Mirah
      needed relief from jealousy. He went on his next visit to Ezra with the
      determination to be resolute in using&mdash;nay, in requesting&mdash;an
      opportunity of private conversation with her. If she accepted his love, he
      felt courageous about all other consequences, and as her betrothed husband
      he would gain a protective authority which might be a desirable defense
      for her in future difficulties with her father. Deronda had not observed
      any signs of growing restlessness in Lapidoth, or of diminished desire to
      recommend himself; but he had forebodings of some future struggle, some
      mortification, or some intolerable increase of domestic disquietude in
      which he might save Ezra and Mirah from being helpless victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      His forebodings would have been strengthened if he had known what was
      going on in the father&rsquo;s mind. That amount of restlessness, that
      desultoriness of attention, which made a small torture to Ezra, was to
      Lapidoth an irksome submission to restraint, only made bearable by his
      thinking of it as a means of by-and-by securing a well-conditioned
      freedom. He began with the intention of awaiting some really good chance,
      such as an opening for getting a considerable sum from Deronda; but all
      the while he was looking about curiously, and trying to discover where
      Mirah deposited her money and her keys. The imperious gambling desire
      within him, which carried on its activity through every other occupation,
      and made a continuous web of imagination that held all else in its meshes,
      would hardly have been under the control of a contracted purpose, if he
      had been able to lay his hands on any sum worth capturing. But Mirah, with
      her practical clear-sightedness, guarded against any frustration of the
      promise she had given to Ezra, by confiding all money, except what she was
      immediately in want of, to Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s care, and Lapidoth felt
      himself under an irritating completeness of supply in kind as in a lunatic
      asylum where everything was made safe against him. To have opened a desk
      or drawer of Mirah&rsquo;s, and pocketed any bank-notes found there, would
      have been to his mind a sort of domestic appropriation which had no
      disgrace in it; the degrees of liberty a man allows himself with other
      people&rsquo;s property being often delicately drawn, even beyond the
      boundary where the law begins to lay its hold&mdash;which is the reason
      why spoons are a safer investment than mining shares. Lapidoth really felt
      himself injuriously treated by his daughter, and thought that he ought to
      have had what he wanted of her other earnings as he had of her apple-tart.
      But he remained submissive; indeed, the indiscretion that most tempted
      him, was not any insistence with Mirah, but some kind of appeal to
      Deronda. Clever persons who have nothing else to sell can often put a good
      price on their absence, and Lapidoth&rsquo;s difficult search for devices
      forced upon him the idea that his family would find themselves happier
      without him, and that Deronda would be willing to advance a considerable
      sum for the sake of getting rid of him. But, in spite of well-practiced
      hardihood, Lapidoth was still in some awe of Ezra&rsquo;s imposing friend,
      and deferred his purpose indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this day, when Deronda had come full of a gladdened consciousness,
      which inevitably showed itself in his air and speech, Lapidoth was at a
      crisis of discontent and longing that made his mind busy with schemes of
      freedom, and Deronda&rsquo;s new amenity encouraged them. This
      pre-occupation was at last so strong as to interfere with his usual show
      of interest in what went forward, and his persistence in sitting by even
      when there was reading which he could not follow. After sitting a little
      while, he went out to smoke and walk in the square, and the two friends
      were all the easier. Mirah was not at home, but she was sure to be in
      again before Deronda left, and his eyes glowed with a secret anticipation:
      he thought that when he saw her again he should see some sweetness of
      recognition for himself to which his eyes had been sealed before. There
      was an additional playful affectionateness in his manner toward Ezra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This little room is too close for you, Ezra,&rdquo; he said,
      breaking off his reading. &ldquo;The week&rsquo;s heat we sometimes get
      here is worse than the heat in Genoa, where one sits in the shaded
      coolness of large rooms. You must have a better home now. I shall do as I
      like with you, being the stronger half.&rdquo; He smiled toward Ezra, who
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am straitened for nothing except breath. But you, who might be in
      a spacious palace, with the wide green country around you, find this a
      narrow prison. Nevertheless, I cannot say, &lsquo;Go.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the country would be a banishment while you are here,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, rising and walking round the double room, which yet offered
      no long promenade, while he made a great fan of his handkerchief. &ldquo;This
      is the happiest room in the world to me. Besides, I will imagine myself in
      the East, since I am getting ready to go there some day. Only I will not
      wear a cravat and a heavy ring there,&rdquo; he ended emphatically,
      pausing to take off those superfluities and deposit them on a small table
      behind Ezra, who had the table in front of him covered with books and
      papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been wearing my memorable ring ever since I came home,&rdquo;
      he went on, as he reseated himself. &ldquo;But I am such a Sybarite that I
      constantly put it off as a burden when I am doing anything. I understand
      why the Romans had summer rings&mdash;<i>if</i> they had them. Now then, I
      shall get on better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were soon absorbed in their work again. Deronda was reading a piece
      of rabbinical Hebrew under Ezra&rsquo;s correction and comment, and they
      took little notice when Lapidoth re-entered and took a seat somewhat in
      the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      His rambling eyes quickly alighted on the ring that sparkled on the bit of
      dark mahogany. During his walk, his mind had been occupied with the
      fiction of an advantageous opening for him abroad, only requiring a sum of
      ready money, which, on being communicated to Deronda in private, might
      immediately draw from him a question as to the amount of the required sum:
      and it was this part of his forecast that Lapidoth found the most
      debatable, there being a danger in asking too much, and a prospective
      regret in asking too little. His own desire gave him no limit, and he was
      quite without guidance as to the limit of Deronda&rsquo;s willingness. But
      now, in the midst of these airy conditions preparatory to a receipt which
      remained indefinite, this ring, which on Deronda&rsquo;s finger had become
      familiar to Lapidoth&rsquo;s envy, suddenly shone detached and within easy
      grasp. Its value was certainly below the smallest of the imaginary sums
      that his purpose fluctuated between; but then it was before him as a solid
      fact, and his desire at once leaped into the thought (not yet an
      intention) that if he were quietly to pocket that ring and walk away he
      would have the means of comfortable escape from present restraint, without
      trouble, and also without danger; for any property of Deronda&rsquo;s
      (available without his formal consent) was all one with his children&rsquo;s
      property, since their father would never be prosecuted for taking it. The
      details of this thinking followed each other so quickly that they seemed
      to rise before him as one picture. Lapidoth had never committed larceny;
      but larceny is a form of appropriation for which people are punished by
      law; and, take this ring from a virtual relation, who would have been
      willing to make a much heavier gift, would not come under the head of
      larceny. Still, the heavier gift was to be preferred, if Lapidoth could
      only make haste enough in asking for it, and the imaginary action of
      taking the ring, which kept repeating itself like an inward tune, sank
      into a rejected idea. He satisfied his urgent longing by resolving to go
      below, and watch for the moment of Deronda&rsquo;s departure, when he
      would ask leave to join him in his walk and boldly carry out his meditated
      plan. He rose and stood looking out of the window, but all the while he
      saw what lay beyond him&mdash;the brief passage he would have to make to
      the door close by the table where the ring was. However he was resolved to
      go down; but&mdash;by no distinct change of resolution, rather by a
      dominance of desire, like the thirst of the drunkard&mdash;it so happened
      that in passing the table his fingers fell noiselessly on the ring, and he
      found himself in the passage with the ring in his hand. It followed that
      he put on his hat and quitted the house. The possibility of again throwing
      himself on his children receded into the indefinite distance, and before
      he was out on the square his sense of haste had concentrated itself on
      selling the ring and getting on shipboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda and Ezra were just aware of his exit; that was all. But,
      by-and-by, Mirah came in and made a real interruption. She had not taken
      off her hat; and when Deronda rose and advanced to shake hands with her,
      she said, in a confusion at once unaccountable and troublesome to herself,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only came in to see that Ezra had his new draught. I must go
      directly to Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s to fetch something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray allow me to walk with you,&rdquo; said Deronda urgently.
      &ldquo;I must not tire Ezra any further; besides my brains are melting. I
      want to go to Mrs. Meyrick&rsquo;s: may I go with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mirah, blushing still more, with the vague
      sense of something new in Deronda, and turning away to pour out Ezra&rsquo;s
      draught; Ezra meanwhile throwing back his head with his eyes shut, unable
      to get his mind away from the ideas that had been filling it while the
      reading was going on. Deronda for a moment stood thinking of nothing but
      the walk, till Mirah turned round again and brought the draught, when he
      suddenly remembered that he had laid aside his cravat, and saying&mdash;&ldquo;Pray
      excuse my dishabille&mdash;I did not mean you to see it,&rdquo; he went to
      the little table, took up his cravat, and exclaimed with a violent impulse
      of surprise, &ldquo;Good heavens, where is my ring gone?&rdquo; beginning
      to search about on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezra looked round the corner of his chair. Mirah, quick as thought, went
      to the spot where Deronda was seeking, and said, &ldquo;Did you lay it
      down?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Deronda, still unvisited by any other explanation
      than that the ring had fallen and was lurking in shadow, indiscernable on
      the variegated carpet. He was moving the bits of furniture near, and
      searching in all possible and impossible places with hand and eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But another explanation had visited Mirah and taken the color from her
      cheeks. She went to Ezra&rsquo;s ear and whispered &ldquo;Was my father
      here?&rdquo; He bent his head in reply, meeting her eyes with terrible
      understanding. She darted back to the spot where Deronda was still casting
      down his eyes in that hopeless exploration which we are apt to carry on
      over a space we have examined in vain. &ldquo;You have not found it?&rdquo;
      she said, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, meeting her frightened gaze, immediately caught alarm from it and
      answered, &ldquo;I perhaps put it in my pocket,&rdquo; professing to feel
      for it there.

    <p>
      She watched him and said, &ldquo;It is not there?&mdash;you put it on the
      table,&rdquo; with a penetrating voice that would not let him feign to
      have found it in his pocket; and immediately she rushed out of the room.
      Deronda followed her&mdash;she was gone into the sitting-room below to
      look for her father&mdash;she opened the door of the bedroom to see if he
      were there&mdash;she looked where his hat usually hung&mdash;she turned
      with her hands clasped tight and her lips pale, gazing despairingly out of
      the window. Then she looked up at Deronda, who had not dared to speak to
      her in her white agitation. She looked up at him, unable to utter a word&mdash;the
      look seemed a tacit acceptance of the humiliation she felt in his
      presence. But he, taking her clasped hands between both his, said, in a
      tone of reverent adoration,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mirah, let me think that he is my father as well as yours&mdash;that
      we can have no sorrow, no disgrace, no joy apart. I will rather take your
      grief to be mine than I would take the brightest joy of another woman. Say
      you will not reject me&mdash;say you will take me to share all things with
      you. Say you will promise to be my wife&mdash;say it now. I have been in
      doubt so long&mdash;I have had to hide my love so long. Say that now and
      always I may prove to you that I love you with complete love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The change in Mirah had been gradual. She had not passed at once from
      anguish to the full, blessed consciousness that, in this moment of grief
      and shame, Deronda was giving her the highest tribute man can give to
      woman. With the first tones and the first words, she had only a sense of
      solemn comfort, referring this goodness of Deronda&rsquo;s to his feeling
      for Ezra. But by degrees the rapturous assurance of unhoped-for good took
      possession of her frame: her face glowed under Deronda&rsquo;s as he bent
      over her; yet she looked up still with intense gravity, as when she had
      first acknowledged with religious gratitude that he had thought her
      &ldquo;worthy of the best;&rdquo; and when he had finished, she could say
      nothing&mdash;she could only lift up her lips to his and just kiss them,
      as if that were the simplest &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; They stood then, only
      looking at each other, he holding her hands between his&mdash;too happy to
      move, meeting so fully in their new consciousness that all signs would
      have seemed to throw them farther apart, till Mirah said in a whisper:
      &ldquo;Let us go and comfort Ezra.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER LXIX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;The human nature unto which I felt
  That I belonged, and reverenced with love,
  Was not a punctual presence, but a spirit
  Diffused through time and space, with aid derived
  Of evidence from monuments, erect,
  Prostrate, or leaning toward their common rest
  In earth, the widely scattered wreck sublime
  Of vanished nations.&rdquo;
                        &mdash;WORDSWORTH: <i>The Prelude</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sir Hugo carried out his plan of spending part of the autumn at Diplow,
      and by the beginning of October his presence was spreading some
      cheerfulness in the neighborhood, among all ranks and persons concerned,
      from the stately home of Brackenshaw and Quetcham to the respectable
      shop-parlors in Wanchester. For Sir Hugo was a man who liked to show
      himself and be affable, a Liberal of good lineage, who confided entirely
      in reform as not likely to make any serious difference in English habits
      of feeling, one of which undoubtedly is the liking to behold society well
      fenced and adorned with hereditary rank. Hence he made Diplow a most
      agreeable house, extending his invitations to old Wanchester solicitors
      and young village curates, but also taking some care in the combination of
      the guests, and not feeding all the common poultry together, so that they
      should think their meal no particular compliment. Easy-going Lord
      Brackenshaw, for example, would not mind meeting Robinson the attorney,
      but Robinson would have been naturally piqued if he had been asked to meet
      a set of people who passed for his equals. On all these points Sir Hugo
      was well informed enough at once to gain popularity for himself and give
      pleasure to others&mdash;two results which eminently suited his
      disposition. The rector of Pennicote now found a reception at Diplow very
      different from the haughty tolerance he had undergone during the reign of
      Grandcourt. It was not that the baronet liked Mr. Gascoigne; it was that
      he desired to keep up a marked relation of friendliness with him on
      account of Mrs. Grandcourt, for whom Sir Hugo&rsquo;s chivalry had become
      more and more engaged. Why? The chief reason was one that he could not
      fully communicate, even to Lady Mallinger&mdash;for he would not tell what
      he thought one woman&rsquo;s secret to another, even though the other was
      his wife&mdash;which shows that his chivalry included a rare reticence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda, after he had become engaged to Mirah, felt it right to make a
      full statement of his position and purposes to Sir Hugo, and he chose to
      make it by letter. He had more than a presentiment that his fatherly
      friend would feel some dissatisfaction, if not pain, at this turn of his
      destiny. In reading unwelcome news, instead of hearing it, there is the
      advantage that one avoids a hasty expression of impatience which may
      afterward be repented of. Deronda dreaded that verbal collision which
      makes otherwise pardonable feeling lastingly offensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sir Hugo, though not altogether surprised, was thoroughly vexed. His
      immediate resource was to take the letter to Lady Mallinger, who would be
      sure to express an astonishment which her husband could argue against as
      unreasonable, and in this way divide the stress of his discontent. And in
      fact when she showed herself astonished and distressed that all Daniel&rsquo;s
      wonderful talents, and the comfort of having him in the house, should have
      ended in his going mad in this way about the Jews, the baronet could say,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense, my dear! depend upon it, Dan will not make a fool of
      himself. He has large notions about Judaism&mdash;political views which
      you can&rsquo;t understand. No fear but Dan will keep himself head
      uppermost.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But with regard to the prospective marriage she afforded him no
      counter-irritant. The gentle lady observed, without rancor, that she had
      little dreamed of what was coming when she had Mirah to sing at her
      musical party and give lessons to Amabel. After some hesitation, indeed,
      she confessed it <i>had</i> passed through her mind that after a proper
      time Daniel might marry Mrs. Grandcourt&mdash;because it seemed so
      remarkable that he should be at Genoa just at that time&mdash;and although
      she herself was not fond of widows she could not help thinking that such a
      marriage would have been better than his going altogether with the Jews.
      But Sir Hugo was so strongly of the same opinion that he could not correct
      it as a feminine mistake; and his ill-humor at the disproof of his
      disagreeable conclusions on behalf of Gwendolen was left without vent. He
      desired Lady Mallinger not to breathe a word about the affair till further
      notice, saying to himself, &ldquo;If it is an unkind cut to the poor thing
      (meaning Gwendolen), the longer she is without knowing it the better, in
      her present nervous state. And she will best learn it from Dan himself.&rdquo;
      Sir Hugo&rsquo;s conjectures had worked so industriously with his
      knowledge, that he fancied himself well informed concerning the whole
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile his residence with his family at Diplow enabled him to continue
      his fatherly attentions to Gwendolen; and in these Lady Mallinger,
      notwithstanding her small liking for widows, was quite willing to second
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan of removal to Offendene had been carried out; and Gwendolen, in
      settling there, maintained a calm beyond her mother&rsquo;s hopes. She was
      experiencing some of that peaceful melancholy which comes from the
      renunciation of demands for self, and from taking the ordinary good of
      existence, and especially kindness, even from a dog, as a gift above
      expectation. Does one who has been all but lost in a pit of darkness
      complain of the sweet air and the daylight? There is a way of looking at
      our life daily as an escape, and taking the quiet return of morn and
      evening&mdash;still more the star-like out-glowing of some pure
      fellow-feeling, some generous impulse breaking our inward darkness&mdash;as
      a salvation that reconciles us to hardship. Those who have a
      self-knowledge prompting such self-accusation as Hamlet&rsquo;s, can
      understand this habitual feeling of rescue. And it was felt by Gwendolen
      as she lived through and through again the terrible history of her
      temptations, from their first form of illusory self-pleasing when she
      struggled away from the hold of conscience, to their latest form of an
      urgent hatred dragging her toward its satisfaction, while she prayed and
      cried for the help of that conscience which she had once forsaken. She was
      now dwelling on every word of Deronda&rsquo;s that pointed to her past
      deliverance from the worst evil in herself, and the worst infliction of it
      on others, and on every word that carried a force to resist self-despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was also upborne by the prospect of soon seeing him again: she did
      not imagine him otherwise than always within her reach, her supreme need
      of him blinding her to the separateness of his life, the whole scene of
      which she filled with his relation to her&mdash;no unique preoccupation of
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s, for we are all apt to fall into this passionate egoism
      of imagination, not only toward our fellow-men, but toward God. And the
      future which she turned her face to with a willing step was one where she
      would be continually assimilating herself to some type that he would hold
      before her. Had he not first risen on her vision as a corrective presence
      which she had recognized in the beginning with resentment, and at last
      with entire love and trust? She could not spontaneously think of an end to
      that reliance, which had become to her imagination like the firmness of
      the earth, the only condition of her walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Deronda was not long before he came to Diplow, which was a more
      convenient distance from town than the Abbey. He had wished to carry out a
      plan for taking Ezra and Mirah to a mild spot on the coast, while he
      prepared another home which Mirah might enter as his bride, and where they
      might unitedly watch over her brother. But Ezra begged not to be removed,
      unless it were to go with them to the East. All outward solicitations were
      becoming more and more of a burden to him; but his mind dwelt on the
      possibility of this voyage with a visionary joy. Deronda, in his
      preparations for the marriage, which he hoped might not be deferred beyond
      a couple of months, wished to have fuller consultation as to his resources
      and affairs generally with Sir Hugo, and here was a reason for not
      delaying his visit to Diplow. But he thought quite as much of another
      reason&mdash;his promise to Gwendolen. The sense of blessedness in his own
      lot had yet an aching anxiety at his heart: this may be held paradoxical,
      for the beloved lover is always called happy, and happiness is considered
      as a well-fleshed indifference to sorrow outside it. But human experience
      is usually paradoxical, if that means incongruous with the phrases of
      current talk or even current philosophy. It was no treason to Mirah, but a
      part of that full nature which made his love for her the more worthy, that
      his joy in her could hold by its side the care for another. For what is
      love itself, for the one we love best?&mdash;an enfolding of immeasurable
      cares which yet are better than any joys outside our love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda came twice to Diplow, and saw Gwendolen twice&mdash;and yet he
      went back to town without having told her anything about the change in his
      lot and prospects. He blamed himself; but in all momentous communication
      likely to give pain we feel dependent on some preparatory turn of words or
      associations, some agreement of the other&rsquo;s mood with the probable
      effect of what we have to impart. In the first interview Gwendolen was so
      absorbed in what she had to say to him, so full of questions which he must
      answer, about the arrangement of her life, what she could do to make
      herself less ignorant, how she could be kindest to everybody, and make
      amends for her selfishness and try to be rid of it, that Deronda utterly
      shrank from waiving her immediate wants in order to speak of himself, nay,
      from inflicting a wound on her in these moments when she was leaning on
      him for help in her path. In the second interview, when he went with new
      resolve to command the conversation into some preparatory track, he found
      her in a state of deep depression, overmastered by some distasteful
      miserable memories which forced themselves on her as something more real
      and ample than any new material out of which she could mould her future.
      She cried hysterically, and said that he would always despise her. He
      could only seek words of soothing and encouragement: and when she
      gradually revived under them, with that pathetic look of renewed childlike
      interest which we see in eyes where the lashes are still beaded with
      tears, it was impossible to lay another burden on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But time went on, and he felt it a pressing duty to make the difficult
      disclosure. Gwendolen, it was true, never recognized his having any
      affairs; and it had never even occurred to her to ask him why he happened
      to be at Genoa. But this unconsciousness of hers would make a sudden
      revelation of affairs that were determining his course in life all the
      heavier blow to her; and if he left the revelation to be made by different
      persons, she would feel that he had treated her with cruel
      inconsiderateness. He could not make the communication in writing: his
      tenderness could not bear to think of her reading his virtual farewell in
      solitude, and perhaps feeling his words full of a hard gladness for
      himself and indifference for her. He went down to Diplow again, feeling
      that every other peril was to be incurred rather than that of returning
      and leaving her still in ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this third visit Deronda found Hans Meyrick installed with his easel at
      Diplow, beginning his picture of the three daughters sitting on a bank,
      &ldquo;in the Gainsborough style,&rdquo; and varying his work by rambling
      to Pennicote to sketch the village children and improve his acquaintance
      with the Gascoignes. Hans appeared to have recovered his vivacity, but
      Deronda detected some feigning in it, as we detect the artificiality of a
      lady&rsquo;s bloom from its being a little too high-toned and steadily
      persistent (a &ldquo;Fluctuating Rouge&rdquo; not having yet appeared
      among the advertisements). Also with all his grateful friendship and
      admiration for Deronda, Hans could not help a certain irritation against
      him, such as extremely incautious, open natures are apt to feel when the
      breaking of a friend&rsquo;s reserve discloses a state of things not
      merely unsuspected but the reverse of what had been hoped and ingeniously
      conjectured. It is true that poor Hans had always cared chiefly to confide
      in Deronda, and had been quite incurious as to any confidence that might
      have been given in return; but what outpourer of his own affairs is not
      tempted to think any hint of his friend&rsquo;s affairs is an egotistic
      irrelevance? That was no reason why it was not rather a sore reflection to
      Hans that while he had been all along naively opening his heart about
      Mirah, Deronda had kept secret a feeling of rivalry which now revealed
      itself as the important determining fact. Moreover, it is always at their
      peril that our friends turn out to be something more than we were aware
      of. Hans must be excused for these promptings of bruised sensibility,
      since he had not allowed them to govern his substantial conduct: he had
      the consciousness of having done right by his fortunate friend; or, as he
      told himself, &ldquo;his metal had given a better ring than he would have
      sworn to beforehand.&rdquo; For Hans had always said that in point of
      virtue he was a <i>dilettante</i>: which meant that he was very fond of it
      in other people, but if he meddled with it himself he cut a poor figure.
      Perhaps in reward of his good behavior he gave his tongue the more
      freedom; and he was too fully possessed by the notion of Deronda&rsquo;s
      happiness to have a conception of what he was feeling about Gwendolen, so
      that he spoke of her without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you come down, Hans?&rdquo; said Deronda, joining him in
      the grounds where he was making a study of the requisite bank and trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ten days ago; before the time Sir Hugo fixed. I ran down with
      Rex Gascoigne and stayed at the rectory a day or two. I&rsquo;m up in all
      the gossip of these parts; I know the state of the wheelwright&rsquo;s
      interior, and have assisted at an infant school examination. Sister Anna,
      with the good upper lip, escorted me, else I should have been mobbed by
      three urchins and an idiot, because of my long hair and a general
      appearance which departs from the Pennicote type of the beautiful.
      Altogether, the village is idyllic. Its only fault is a dark curate with
      broad shoulders and broad trousers who ought to have gone into the heavy
      drapery line. The Gascoignes are perfect&mdash;besides being related to
      the Vandyke duchess. I caught a glimpse of her in her black robes at a
      distance, though she doesn&rsquo;t show to visitors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was not staying at the rectory?&rdquo; said Deronda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I was taken to Offendene to see the old house, and as a
      consequence I saw the duchess&rsquo; family. I suppose you have been there
      and know all about them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have been there,&rdquo; said Deronda, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine old place. An excellent setting for a widow with romantic
      fortunes. And she seems to have had several romances. I think I have found
      out that there was one between her and my friend Rex.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not long before her marriage, then?&rdquo; said Deronda, really
      interested, &ldquo;for they had only been a year at Offendene. How came
      you to know anything of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;not ignorant of what it is to be a miserable devil, I
      learn to gloat on the signs of misery in others. I found out that Rex
      never goes to Offendene, and has never seen the duchess since she came
      back; and Miss Gascoigne let fall something in our talk about
      charade-acting&mdash;for I went through some of my nonsense to please the
      young ones&mdash;something that proved to me that Rex was once hovering
      about his fair cousin close enough to get singed. I don&rsquo;t know what
      was her part in the affair. Perhaps the duke came in and carried her off.
      That is always the way when an exceptionally worthy young man forms an
      attachment. I understand now why Gascoigne talks of making the law his
      mistress and remaining a bachelor. But these are green resolves. Since the
      duke did not get himself drowned for your sake, it may turn out to be for
      my friend Rex&rsquo;s sake. Who knows?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it absolutely necessary that Mrs. Grandcourt should marry again?&rdquo;
      said Deronda, ready to add that Hans&rsquo;s success in constructing her
      fortunes hitherto had not been enough to warrant a new attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You monster!&rdquo; retorted Hans, &ldquo;do you want her to wear
      weeds for <i>you</i> all her life&mdash;burn herself in perpetual suttee
      while you are alive and merry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda could say nothing, but he looked so much annoyed that Hans turned
      the current of his chat, and when he was alone shrugged his shoulders a
      little over the thought that there really had been some stronger feeling
      between Deronda and the duchess than Mirah would like to know of. &ldquo;Why
      didn&rsquo;t she fall in love with me?&rdquo; thought Hans, laughing at
      himself. &ldquo;She would have had no rivals. No woman ever wanted to
      discuss theology with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder that Deronda winced under that sort of joking with a whip-lash.
      It touched sensibilities that were already quivering with the anticipation
      of witnessing some of that pain to which even Hans&rsquo;s light words
      seemed to give more reality:&mdash;any sort of recognition by another
      giving emphasis to the subject of our anxiety. And now he had come down
      with the firm resolve that he would not again evade the trial. The next
      day he rode to Offendene. He had sent word that he intended to call and to
      ask if Gwendolen could receive him; and he found her awaiting him in the
      old drawing-room where some chief crises of her life had happened. She
      seemed less sad than he had seen her since her husband&rsquo;s death;
      there was no smile on her face, but a placid self-possession, in contrast
      with the mood in which he had last found her. She was all the more alive
      to the sadness perceptible in Deronda; and they were no sooner seated&mdash;he
      at a little distance opposite to her&mdash;than she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were afraid of coming to see me, because I was so full of grief
      and despair the last time. But I am not so today. I have been sorry ever
      since. I have been making it a reason why I should keep up my hope and be
      as cheerful as I can, because I would not give you any pain about me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an unwonted sweetness in Gwendolen&rsquo;s tone and look as she
      uttered these words that seemed to Deronda to infuse the utmost cruelty
      into the task now laid upon him. But he felt obliged to make his answer a
      beginning of the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>am</i> in some trouble to-day,&rdquo; he said, looking at her
      rather mournfully; &ldquo;but it is because I have things to tell you
      which you will almost think it a want of confidence on my part not to have
      spoken of before. They are things affecting my own life&mdash;my own
      future. I shall seem to have made an ill return to you for the trust you
      have placed in me&mdash;never to have given you an idea of events that
      make great changes for me. But when we have been together we have hardly
      had time to enter into subjects which at the moment were really less
      pressing to me than the trials you have been going through.&rdquo; There
      was a sort of timid tenderness in Deronda&rsquo;s deep tones, and he
      paused with a pleading look, as if it had been Gwendolen only who had
      conferred anything in her scenes of beseeching and confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thrill of surprise was visible in her. Such meaning as she found in his
      words had shaken her, but without causing fear. Her mind had flown at once
      to some change in his position with regard to Sir Hugo and Sir Hugo&rsquo;s
      property. She said, with a sense of comfort from Deronda&rsquo;s way of
      asking her pardon,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never thought of anything but what you could do to help me; and
      I was so troublesome. How could you tell me things?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will perhaps astonish you,&rdquo; said Deronda, &ldquo;that I
      have only quite lately known who were my parents.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen was not astonished: she felt the more assured that her
      expectations of what was coming were right. Deronda went on without check.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason why you found me in Italy was that I had gone there to
      learn that&mdash;in fact, to meet my mother. It was by her wish that I was
      brought up in ignorance of my parentage. She parted with me after my
      father&rsquo;s death, when I was a little creature. But she is now very
      ill, and she felt that the secrecy ought not to be any longer maintained.
      Her chief reason had been that she did not wish me to know I was a Jew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>A Jew</i>!&rdquo; Gwendolen exclaimed, in a low tone of
      amazement, with an utterly frustrated look, as if some confusing potion
      were creeping through her system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda colored, and did not speak, while Gwendolen, with her eyes fixed
      on the floor, was struggling to find her way in the dark by the aid of
      various reminiscences. She seemed at last to have arrived at some
      judgment, for she looked up at Deronda again and said, as if remonstrating
      against the mother&rsquo;s conduct,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference need that have made?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has made a great difference to me that I have known it,&rdquo;
      said Deronda, emphatically; but he could not go on easily&mdash;the
      distance between her ideas and his acted like a difference of native
      language, making him uncertain what force his words would carry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen meditated again, and then said feelingly, &ldquo;I hope there is
      nothing to make you mind. <i>You</i> are just the same as if you were not
      a Jew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She meant to assure him that nothing of that external sort could affect
      the way in which she regarded him, or the way in which he could influence
      her. Deronda was a little helped by this misunderstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The discovery was far from being painful to me,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;I had been gradually prepared for it, and I was glad of it. I had
      been prepared for it by becoming intimate with a very remarkable Jew,
      whose ideas have attracted me so much that I think of devoting the best
      part of my life to some effort at giving them effect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Gwendolen seemed shaken&mdash;again there was a look of frustration,
      but this time it was mingled with alarm. She looked at Deronda with lips
      childishly parted. It was not that she had yet connected his words with
      Mirah and her brother, but that they had inspired her with a dreadful
      presentiment of mountainous travel for her mind before it could reach
      Deronda&rsquo;s. Great ideas in general which she had attributed to him
      seemed to make no great practical difference, and were not formidable in
      the same way as these mysteriously-shadowed particular ideas. He could not
      quite divine what was going on within her; he could only seek the least
      abrupt path of disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is an object,&rdquo; he said, after a moment, &ldquo;which
      will by-and-by force me to leave England for some time&mdash;for some
      years. I have purposes which will take me to the East.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was something clearer, but all the more immediately agitating.
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s lips began to tremble. &ldquo;But you will come back?&rdquo;
      she said, tasting her own tears as they fell, before she thought of drying
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda could not sit still. He rose, and went to prop himself against the
      corner of the mantel-piece, at a different angle from her face. But when
      she had pressed her handkerchief against her cheeks, she turned and looked
      up at him, awaiting an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I live,&rdquo; said Deronda&mdash;&ldquo;<i>some time</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both silent. He could not persuade himself to say more unless
      she led up to it by a question; and she was apparently meditating
      something that she had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; she asked, at last, very mildly.
      &ldquo;Can I understand the ideas, or am I too ignorant?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to the East to become better acquainted with the
      condition of my race in various countries there,&rdquo; said Deronda,
      gently&mdash;anxious to be as explanatory as he could on what was the
      impersonal part of their separateness from each other. &ldquo;The idea
      that I am possessed with is that of restoring a political existence to my
      people, making them a nation again, giving them a national center, such as
      the English have, though they too are scattered over the face of the
      globe. That is a task which presents itself to me as a duty; I am resolved
      to begin it, however feebly. I am resolved to devote my life to it. At the
      least, I may awaken a movement in other minds, such as has been awakened
      in my own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence between them. The world seemed getting larger
      round poor Gwendolen, and she more solitary and helpless in the midst. The
      thought that he might come back after going to the East, sank before the
      bewildering vision of these wild-stretching purposes in which she felt
      herself reduced to a mere speck. There comes a terrible moment to many
      souls when the great movements of the world, the larger destinies of
      mankind, which have lain aloof in newspapers and other neglected reading,
      enter like an earthquake into their own lives&mdash;where the slow urgency
      of growing generations turns into the tread of an invading army or the
      dire clash of civil war, and gray fathers know nothing to seek for but the
      corpses of their blooming sons, and girls forget all vanity to make lint
      and bandages which may serve for the shattered limbs of their betrothed
      husbands. Then it is as if the Invisible Power that had been the object of
      lip-worship and lip-resignation became visible, according to the imagery
      of the Hebrew poet, making the flames his chariot, and riding on the wings
      of the wind, till the mountains smoke and the plains shudder under the
      rolling fiery visitations. Often the good cause seems to lie prostrate
      under the thunder of unrelenting force, the martyrs live reviled, they
      die, and no angel is seen holding forth the crown and the palm branch.
      Then it is that the submission of the soul to the Highest is tested, and
      even in the eyes of frivolity life looks out from the scene of human
      struggle with the awful face of duty, and a religion shows itself which is
      something else than a private consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the sort of crisis which was at this moment beginning in
      Gwendolen&rsquo;s small life: she was for the first time feeling the
      pressure of a vast mysterious movement, for the first time being dislodged
      from her supremacy in her own world, and getting a sense that her horizon
      was but a dipping onward of an existence with which her own was revolving.
      All the troubles of her wifehood and widowhood had still left her with the
      implicit impression which had accompanied her from childhood, that
      whatever surrounded her was somehow specially for her, and it was because
      of this that no personal jealousy had been roused in her relation to
      Deronda: she could not spontaneously think of him as rightfully belonging
      to others more than to her. But here had come a shock which went deeper
      than personal jealousy&mdash;something spiritual and vaguely tremendous
      that thrust her away, and yet quelled all her anger into self-humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a long silence. Deronda had stood still, even thankful for
      an interval before he needed to say more, and Gwendolen had sat like a
      statue with her wrists lying over each other and her eyes fixed&mdash;the
      intensity of her mental action arresting all other excitation. At length
      something occurred to her that made her turn her face to Deronda and say
      in a trembling voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all you can tell me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was like a dart to him. &ldquo;The Jew whom I mentioned just
      now,&rdquo; he answered, not without a certain tremor in his tones too,
      &ldquo;the remarkable man who has greatly influenced my mind, has not
      perhaps been totally unheard of by you. He is the brother of Miss
      Lapidoth, whom you have often heard sing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A great wave of remembrance passed through Gwendolen and spread as a deep,
      painful flush over neck and face. It had come first at the scene of that
      morning when she had called on Mirah, and heard Deronda&rsquo;s voice
      reading, and been told, without then heeding it, that he was reading
      Hebrew with Mirah&rsquo;s brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very ill&mdash;very near death now,&rdquo; Deronda went on,
      nervously, and then stopped short. He felt that he must wait. Would she
      divine the rest?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she tell you that I went to her?&rdquo; said Gwendolen,
      abruptly, looking up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Deronda. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away her eyes again, and sat thinking. Slowly the color dried
      out of face and neck, and she was as pale as before&mdash;with that almost
      withered paleness which is seen after a painful flush. At last she said&mdash;without
      turning toward him&mdash;in a low, measured voice, as if she were only
      thinking aloud in preparation for future speech,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>can</i> you marry?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Deronda, also in a low voice. &ldquo;I am going to
      marry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At first there was no change in Gwendolen&rsquo;s attitude: she only began
      to tremble visibly; then she looked before her with dilated eyes, as at
      something lying in front of her, till she stretched her arms out straight,
      and cried with a smothered voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I should be forsaken. I have been a cruel woman. And I am
      forsaken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda&rsquo;s anguish was intolerable. He could not help himself. He
      seized her outstretched hands and held them together, and kneeled at her
      feet. She was the victim of his happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am cruel, too, I am cruel,&rdquo; he repeated, with a sort of
      groan, looking up at her imploringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His presence and touch seemed to dispel a horrible vision, and she met his
      upward look of sorrow with something like the return of consciousness
      after fainting. Then she dwelt on it with that growing pathetic movement
      of the brow which accompanies the revival of some tender recollection. The
      look of sorrow brought back what seemed a very far-off moment&mdash;the
      first time she had ever seen it, in the library at the Abbey. Sobs rose,
      and great tears fell fast. Deronda would not let her hands go&mdash;held
      them still with one of his, and himself pressed her handkerchief against
      her eyes. She submitted like a half-soothed child, making an effort to
      speak, which was hindered by struggling sobs. At last she succeeded in
      saying, brokenly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said&mdash;I said&mdash;it should be better&mdash;better with me&mdash;for
      having known you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes too were larger with tears. She wrested one of her hands from
      his, and returned his action, pressing his tears away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall not be quite parted,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will write
      to you always, when I can, and you will answer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited till she said in a whisper, &ldquo;I will try.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be more with you than I used to be,&rdquo; Deronda said
      with gentle urgency, releasing her hands and rising from his kneeling
      posture. &ldquo;If we had been much together before, we should have felt
      our differences more, and seemed to get farther apart. Now we can perhaps
      never see each other again. But our minds may get nearer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen said nothing, but rose too, automatically. Her withered look of
      grief, such as the sun often shines on when the blinds are drawn up after
      the burial of life&rsquo;s joy, made him hate his own words: they seemed
      to have the hardness of easy consolation in them. She felt that he was
      going, and that nothing could hinder it. The sense of it was like a
      dreadful whisper in her ear, which dulled all other consciousness; and she
      had not known that she was rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deronda could not speak again. He thought that they must part in silence,
      but it was difficult to move toward the parting, till she looked at him
      with a sort of intention in her eyes, which helped him. He advanced to put
      out his hand silently, and when she had placed hers within it, she said
      what her mind had been laboring with,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been very good to me. I have deserved nothing. I will try&mdash;try
      to live. I shall think of you. What good have I been? Only harm. Don&rsquo;t
      let me be harm to <i>you</i>. It shall be the better for me&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not finish. It was not that she was sobbing, but that the
      intense effort with which she spoke made her too tremulous. The burden of
      that difficult rectitude toward him was a weight her frame tottered under.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent forward to kiss his cheek, and he kissed hers. Then they looked
      at each other for an instant with clasped hands, and he turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was quite gone, her mother came in and found her sitting
      motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gwendolen, dearest, you look very ill,&rdquo; she said, bending
      over her and touching her cold hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mamma. But don&rsquo;t be afraid. I am going to live,&rdquo;
      said Gwendolen, bursting out hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother persuaded her to go to bed, and watched by her. Through the day
      and half the night she fell continually into fits of shrieking, but cried
      in the midst of them to her mother, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. I shall
      live. I mean to live.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, she slept; and when she waked in the morning light, she looked
      up fixedly at her mother and said tenderly, &ldquo;Ah, poor mamma! You
      have been sitting up with me. Don&rsquo;t be unhappy. I shall live. I
      shall be better.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    In the checkered area of human experience the seasons are all mingled
    as in the golden age: fruit and blossom hang together; in the same
    moment the sickle is reaping and the seed is sprinkled; one tends the
    green cluster and another treads the winepress. Nay, in each of our
    lives harvest and spring-time are continually one, until himself
    gathers us and sows us anew in his invisible fields.
</pre>
    <p>
      Among the blessings of love there is hardly one more exquisite than the
      sense that in uniting the beloved life to ours we can watch over its
      happiness, bring comfort where hardship was, and over memories of
      privation and suffering open the sweetest fountains of joy. Deronda&rsquo;s
      love for Mirah was strongly imbued with that blessed protectiveness. Even
      with infantine feet she had begun to tread among thorns; and the first
      time he had beheld her face it had seemed to him the girlish image of
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now she was glowing like a dark-tipped yet delicate ivory-tinted
      flower in the warm sunlight of content, thinking of any possible grief as
      part of that life with Deronda, which she could call by no other name than
      good. And he watched the sober gladness which gave new beauty to her
      movements; and her habitual attitudes of repose, with a delight which made
      him say to himself that it was enough of personal joy for him to save her
      from pain. She knew nothing of Hans&rsquo;s struggle or of Gwendolen&rsquo;s
      pang; for after the assurance that Deronda&rsquo;s hidden love had been
      for her, she easily explained Gwendolen&rsquo;s eager solicitude about him
      as part of a grateful dependence on his goodness, such as she herself had
      known. And all Deronda&rsquo;s words about Mrs. Grandcourt confirmed that
      view of their relation, though he never touched on it except in the most
      distant manner. Mirah was ready to believe that he had been a rescuing
      angel to many besides herself. The only wonder was, that she among them
      all was to have the bliss of being continually by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when the bridal veil was around Mirah it hid no doubtful tremors&mdash;only
      a thrill of awe at the acceptance of a great gift which required great
      uses. And the velvet canopy never covered a more goodly bride and
      bridegroom, to whom their people might more wisely wish offspring; more
      truthful lips never touched the sacrament marriage-wine; the
      marriage-blessing never gathered stronger promise of fulfillment than in
      the integrity of their mutual pledge. Naturally, they were married
      according to the Jewish rite. And since no religion seems yet to have
      demanded that when we make a feast we should invite only the highest rank
      of our acquaintances, few, it is to be hoped, will be offended to learn
      that among the guests at Deronda&rsquo;s little wedding-feast was the
      entire Cohen family, with the one exception of the baby who carried on her
      teething intelligently at home. How could Mordecai have borne that those
      friends of his adversity should have been shut out from rejoicing in
      common with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Meyrick so fully understood this that she had quite reconciled
      herself to meeting the Jewish pawnbroker, and was there with her three
      daughters&mdash;all of them enjoying the consciousness that Mirah&rsquo;s
      marriage to Deronda crowned a romance which would always make a sweet
      memory to them. For which of them, mother or girls, had not had a generous
      part in it&mdash;giving their best in feeling and in act to her who
      needed? If Hans could have been there, it would have been better; but Mab
      had already observed that men must suffer for being so inconvenient;
      suppose she, Kate, and Amy had all fallen in love with Mr. Deronda?&mdash;but
      being women they were not so ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Meyricks were rewarded for conquering their prejudices by hearing a
      speech from Mr. Cohen, which had the rare quality among speeches of not
      being quite after the usual pattern. Jacob ate beyond his years, and
      contributed several small whinnying laughs as a free accompaniment of his
      father&rsquo;s speech, not irreverently, but from a lively sense that his
      family was distinguishing itself; while Adelaide Rebekah, in a new Sabbath
      frock, maintained throughout a grave air of responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mordecai&rsquo;s brilliant eyes, sunken in their large sockets, dwelt on
      the scene with the cherishing benignancy of a spirit already lifted into
      an aloofness which nullified only selfish requirements and left sympathy
      alive. But continually, after his gaze had been traveling round on the
      others, it returned to dwell on Deronda with a fresh gleam of trusting
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding-feast was humble, but Mirah was not without splendid
      wedding-gifts. As soon as the betrothal had been known, there were friends
      who had entertained graceful devices. Sir Hugo and Lady Mallinger had
      taken trouble to provide a complete equipment for Eastern travel, as well
      as a precious locket containing an inscription&mdash;&ldquo;<i>To the
      bride of our dear Daniel Deronda all blessings. H. and L. M.</i>&rdquo;
      The Klesmers sent a perfect watch, also with a pretty inscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      But something more precious than gold and gems came to Deronda from the
      neighborhood of Diplow on the morning of his marriage. It was a letter
      containing these words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Do not think of me sorrowfully on your wedding-day. I have remembered
    your words&mdash;that I may live to be one of the best of women, who
    make others glad that they were born. I do not yet see how that can
    be, but you know better than I. If it ever comes true, it will be
    because you helped me. I only thought of myself, and I made you
    grieve. It hurts me now to think of your grief. You must not grieve
    any more for me. It is better&mdash;it shall be better with me because I
    have known you.

    GWENDOLEN GRANDCOURT.
</pre>
    <p>
      The preparations for the departure of all three to the East began at once;
      for Deronda could not deny Ezra&rsquo;s wish that they should set out on
      the voyage forthwith, so that he might go with them, instead of detaining
      them to watch over him. He had no belief that Ezra&rsquo;s life would last
      through the voyage, for there were symptoms which seemed to show that the
      last stage of his malady had set in. But Ezra himself had said, &ldquo;Never
      mind where I die, so that I am with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not set out with them. One morning early he said to Deronda,
      &ldquo;Do not quit me to-day. I shall die before it is ended.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He chose to be dressed and sit up in his easy chair as usual, Deronda and
      Mirah on each side of him, and for some hours he was unusually silent, not
      even making the effort to speak, but looking at them occasionally with
      eyes full of some restful meaning, as if to assure them that while this
      remnant of breathing-time was difficult, he felt an ocean of peace beneath
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till late in the afternoon, when the light was falling, that he
      took a hand of each in his and said, looking at Deronda, &ldquo;Death is
      coming to me as the divine kiss which is both parting and reunion&mdash;which
      takes me from your bodily eyes and gives me full presence in your soul.
      Where thou goest, Daniel, I shall go. Is it not begun? Have I not breathed
      my soul into you? We shall live together.&rdquo;
    </p>

      He paused, and Deronda waited, thinking that there might be another word
      for him. But slowly and with effort Ezra, pressing on their hands, raised
      himself and uttered in Hebrew the confession of the divine Unity, which
      long for generations has been on the lips of the dying Israelite.

      He sank back gently into his chair, and did not speak again. But it was
      some hours before he had ceased to breathe, with Mirah&rsquo;s and Deronda&rsquo;s
      arms around him.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
